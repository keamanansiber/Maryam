Cybersecurity in the food and beverage industry: A reference framework. Given the tendency of food companies to adopt digital technologies throughout the food supply chain and the importance assumed by the security and reliability of these systems in Industry 4.0 applications, we carried out a systematic literature review of cybersecurity issues in food and beverage industry. The research methodology was defined based on the PRISMA guidelines, and a reference framework was created that leveraged a thematic analysis of the following content categories: definitions, focus on the food and beverage industry, characterization of cybersecurity, and management of cybersecurity risks. This analysis allowed us to compare the advancement in cybersecurity in the food and beverage industry with those proposed in the literature for the Industry 4.0 paradigm. This comparison is useful, since although the Industry 4.0 paradigm finds a wide range of applications in such domain (e.g., Agriculture 4.0), the structural characteristics of this sector, its supply chain and products create a specific context and situations that may require ad hoc cybersecurity strategies and solutions. The body of knowledge on the food and beverage industry resulted mature in terms of definitions, the target supply chain, industrial assets, and cyber-threats, but requires future research effort in terms of practical analysis that can fill the emerging gaps in relation to risks, countermeasures, vulnerabilities, solutions and guidelines. The results of our review guided discussions, implications and definition of future research routes. Cybersecurity. Food and beverage. Industry 4.0. Systematic literature review. 
The role of cybersecurity and policy awareness in shifting employee compliance attitudes: Building supply chain capabilities. This paper investigates the role of general cybersecurity and cybersecurity policy awareness in enhancing supply chain cyber resilience reactive capabilities. Theorizing from the Protection Motivation Theory, 200 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were contacted to understand their perception of cybersecurity and policy awareness in affecting their overall cybersecurity hygiene. Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire survey and analysed via Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modelling to validate the research framework. Results of analysis outlined the importance of general cybersecurity and policy awareness in shifting employees’ compliance attitude towards enhancing supply chain reactive capability. Using a mixed-method approach, post-survey interviews were further conducted with practitioners in SMEs to understand the study findings. The implications outlined in this study emphasises the importance of prioritising preventive measures and proper employee cyber hygiene to address the risk and loss following a cyber-attack. Key supply chain operational areas in SMEs are still largely supported by the human workforce serving as its backbone. An unwarranted attack could cause adverse business impacts. Thus, practitioners and SMEs would be alerted to the critical need for a robust security posture and that SMEs’ need of the hour lies at the core of its policy and employee cybersecurity hygiene.

Cybersecurity strategy under uncertainties for an IoE environment. Internet of Everything (IoE) technology is increasingly being used by companies to modernize their activities. The very specific characteristics of such environments, in particular, their vulnerable exchanged data and the weak nature of the connected things, expose these companies to risks and security breaches. The principal objective of our work is to provide a cybersecurity strategy capable to consider all types of attacks that can affect an IoE environment while respecting the specified budget. For this purpose, a financial approach based on portfolio management is exploited by allowing to select a portfolio of security controls that minimizes the direct costs and maximizes the security level control. To be solved, the considered problem is assimilated to a combinatorial optimization technique and more precisely to that of the knapsack. We start by modeling the cybersecurity problem under cardinality and budget constraints that should be respected. To tackle the uncertainty of the problem, a robust optimization is used by considering the min-max criterion al-lowing to consider all the possible threats that can be generated by an attacker over the IoE environment. To solve the considered problem, we use a new iterative method under constraints and we compare it to the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) meta-heuristic to evaluate its performances. The obtained numeric results when evaluating the performances of the proposed strategy have shown its efficiency by finding efficient Pareto fronts for the two considered objective functions. Based on the iterative method, our strategy greatly outperforms the genetic algorithm by allowing good results for different problem sizes and respecting cardinality constraints in a reasonable time.

The Cultural Construction of Cybersecurity: Digital Threats and Dangerous Rhetoric [A Construção Cultural da Cibersegurança: Ameaças Digitais e Retórica Perigosa]. This article explores the contemporary construction of public culture around cybersecurity in the United States, using discourse analysis to critically examine the rise of militaristic rhetoric around digital threats in news reports and public statements by government officials and corporate experts. Cybersecurity has gone from being an obscure focus of tech and security experts to an issue of public concern. My approach advances theorizations of digital media and politics by bringing together insights from digital media studies and the anthropology of security to analyze how public culture around cybersecurity is being discursively constructed by authorities, and to advance theorizations of digital media and politics. Given the pervasive role of digital media in Americans’ lives, I contend that discourses that represent cybersecurity in terms of national security, equating hacking with cyberwar and cyberterrorism, contribute to the militarization of private civil and social life while failing to address wider vulnerabilities and threats to democracy associated with digital media.

The role of national cybersecurity strategies on the improvement of cybersecurity education. Digital information and telecommunication technologies have not only become essential to individuals’ daily lives but also to a nation's sustained economic growth, societal well-being, critical infrastructure resilience, and national security. Consequently, the protection of a nation's cyber sovereignty from malicious acts is a major concern. This signifies the importance of cybersecurity education in facilitating the creation of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem and in supporting cyber sovereignty. This study reviews a sample from world-leading countries National Cybersecurity Strategic Plans (NCSPs) and analyzes the associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement initiatives. Furthermore, a proposal to adopt the Goal-Question-Outcomes(GQO)+Strategies paradigm into cybersecurity education and training programs curricula improvement to national cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. The proposal maps cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies using the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework. The newly proposed cybersecurity education and training programs’ curricula learning outcomes were generated from the GQO+Strategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic goals: Development of secure digital and information technology infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats, and enrichment of individuals’ cybersecurity maturity and awareness. It is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program administrators utilize the proposed GQO+Strategies to align their program's curriculum to NCSP. Hence, closing the gap that exists with the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces. Cybersecurity curricula. Cybersecurity education. Cybersecurity strategic plan.

Cybersecurity education, awareness raising, and training initiatives: National level evidence-based results, challenges, and promise. This paper assesses the impact of cybersecurity education, awareness raising, and training (CEAT) on the vitality of internet use and services at the national level. CEAT encompasses one of five dimensions of a larger cybersecurity capacity building model (CMM) that was developed by the Global Cybersecurity Capacity Centre. The paper describes this dimension of capacity building within the CMM, and its indicators of education, awareness, and training in cybersecurity capacity. The paper then presents a cross-national analysis of the outcomes of CEAT on internet use based on comparative data from 80 nations. Controlling for contextual variables, such as the wealth of the nations and scale of internet use, the analysis shows a positive and statistically significant impact of CEAT on the vitality of internet use and services, as well as a distribution of CEAT scores that indicates key issues for low-income and developing nations. A qualitative analysis of responses from these nations is used to identify key reasons for their levels of maturity in this area. While recognising key limitations of these findings, it offers suggestions for policy and practice to meet the need for effective programs for education, awareness raising, and training. In addition, the research suggests the need for more detailed indicators of CEAT initiatives in more nations and over time to assess the validity of the findings and the recommendations for policy and practice in this area of capacity building offered in this paper.

An electric power digital twin for cyber security testing, research and education. Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) rely on communication and control technologies to efficiently manage devices in the system. However, a wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into integrated networks, including smart grid (SG). SG security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to train and test cyber attacks in a safe/controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying physical configuration and scalability. To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on SGs. The twin enable users to deploy real world attacks and countermeasures, and study its effectiveness. In the twin users may easily modify the components and configurations unlike in a physical test-bed. Further, reproducing the twin for advancing the research is significantly cheaper. We illustrate the typical use case with an example case study. Cyber Physical System. Digital twin. Security. Smartgrid. Test-bed. 
A new DDoS attacks intrusion detection model based on deep learning for cybersecurity. The data is exposed to many attacks during communication in the network environment. It is becoming increasingly essential to identify intrusions into network communications. Researchers use machine learning techniques to design effective intrusion detection systems. In this study, we proposed an intrusion detection system that includes preprocessing procedures and a deep learning model to detect DDoS attacks. For this purpose, various models based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have been evaluated in terms of detection performance and real-time performance. We tested the suggested model using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which is frequently used in the literature. We applied preprocess techniques such as feature elimination, random subset selection, feature selection, duplication removal, and normalization to the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. As a result, better recognition performance was obtained for the training and testing evaluations. According to the test results, 99.99% for binary and 99.30% for multiclass accuracy using the CNN-based inception like model gave the best results among the proposed models. Also, the inference time of the proposed model for various sizes of test data looks promising compared to baseline models with a smaller number of trainable parameters. The proposed IDS system, together with the preprocessing methods, provides better results when compared to state-of-the-art studies. Cloud security. Data preprocessing. DDoS. Deep learning.

Anomalous distributed traffic: Detecting cyber security attacks amongst microservices using graph convolutional networks. Currently, microservices are trending as the most popular software application design architecture. Software organisations are also being targeted by more cyber-attacks every day and newer security measures are in high demand. One available measure is the application of anomaly detection, which is defined as the discovery of irregular or unusual activity that occurs to a greater or lesser degree than normal occurrences in a data series. In this paper, we continue existing work where various real-world cyber-attacks are executed against a running microservices application, and the application traffic is logged and returned in the form of distributed traces. A Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network is used to model the set of distributed traces and learn the spatial and temporal dependencies of the application traffic. Subsequently, the model is used to make predictions for ongoing microservice activity and threshold-based anomaly detection is applied to detect irregular microservice activity indicating the presence of seeded cyber security attacks, or anomalies. The cyber-attacks used to evaluate this approach include a brute force attack, a batch registration of bot accounts and a distributed denial of service attack. Anomaly detection. Cyber security.

Enhancing cybersecurity by generating user-specific security policy through the formal modeling of user behavior. Organizations today are faced with the difficult challenge of balancing the embrace of new and emerging technology, and securing their systems and data that support critical business functions. Although there have been significant advances in security enforcement technology, attackers are still able to compromise organizations and access. The impacts of computer intrusions have become so untenable that many organizations are looking at a drastic rethinking of their approach to the security of internal networks. This approach is called Zero Trust and it seeks to remove all notion of a trusted internal network boundary. The benefits of Zero Trust include significantly increasing the work that attackers would need to perform to achieve their objectives. But Zero Trust will also increase the management complexity for internal security teams. These teams will need a way to collect data and enforce policy decisions based upon analysis. This process will need to be done for all organizational systems, and data, and it will need to be done in all access contexts. Our approach uses formal methods to model and examine end-users security-related behaviors. Researchers have found that the users’ security decisions correlate with factors including demographics, personality traits, decision-making styles, and risk-taking preferences. We describe these behaviors by using Finite-State Automata (FSA). This allows for the automated formulation of linear-time security properties based on Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL). The logic is then used to check the satisfaction of collected and observed security behaviors against policy. This formal behavioral analysis could be combined with other security and network data during the context analysis process that needs to occur for each Zero Trust access request. Other network or host security data could include address identifiers, tokens, event data, packet inspection, running process data, cyber threat intelligence, and much more. Our method allows organizations that embrace a Zero Trust philosophy to generate context specific security policies that can be automatically verified for correctness and completion.

A systematic synthesis of critical success factors for cybersecurity. Extant studies suggest that cybersecurity is critical and among the IT spending priorities of organizations. In response, the literature draws attention to the cybersecurity critical success factors (CSFs) that enable organizations to focus their scarce resources accordingly. Following a systematic literature review method, we analyze and synthesize extant CSF studies on cybersecurity implementation and management for organizations. Then, drawing on the synthesized CSFs and blending them with IT capability theory, we present an overarching cybersecurity CSF framework building upon 79 cybersecurity elements grouped into 11 CSFs under five dimensions of cybersecurity capability: organizational, infrastructural, strategic, process, and external. In addition, the descriptive analysis of the search results reveals the importance of the various factors and capabilities, the trend of the cybersecurity capability dimensions, the frequency and types of research methods, and the contextual impact of the factors. This research makes an important contribution to the literature on cybersecurity management. The CSF framework serves as the foundation for future researchers interested in measuring organizational cybersecurity success. In addition, practitioners can employ the synthesized CSFs and associated elements to guide their cybersecurity management. Critical success factors. Cybersecurity. IT capability theory.

A novel extended Internet of things (IoT) Cybersecurity protection based on adaptive deep learning prediction for industrial manufacturing applications. The use of the Internet of things (IoT) devices is growing rapidly in the current industrial market. Integrating these devices into the network system has subjected the information to Cybersecurity attacks putting the market of IoT technology at risk. As a result, accurate protection algorithms and efficient monitoring systems need to be developed. This paper proposes a new framework design relays on a stochastic measurement of determining parameters based on a novel adaptive deep learning (ADL) algorithm for industrial manufacturing such as transportation, energy. The new framework will be designed to incorporate an element of randomness as opposed to deterministic frameworks. The implemented method considered the network forensic systems and intrusion detection (ID). therefore, the prediction model is set up to alert the administrator about the system status. The framework is proposed based on five prioritized protection stages. The developed model tested on the Bot-IoT dataset, which is well-structured and valid for training, as confirmed by literature. The result has shown the ability to simulate the IoT network traffic along with risk assessment against different types of attacks by using the ADL algorithm. The new framework will be designed to improve computational efficiency by being able to adjust their structure based on the inputs. The research contributions are that it will help in the development of an algorithm which can minimize traffic accidents, improve traffic flow, minimize energy wastes, and save costs of controlling traffic flow. Findings show that using this new algorithm has 100% accuracy, which makes it an excellent choice for the detection of threats and errors. Deep learning. Industrial manufacturing.

Digital transformation of the maritime industry: A cybersecurity systemic approach. Information system solutions are increasingly being applied to the maritime industry, and eventually, all aspects of maritime operations will be aided by the digital transformation of the industry. The maritime industry is a sector driven by compliance and historically deals with security and safety matters at an international level. It has been recognized that safety and security in maritime heavily depend on cyber systems and cybersecurity implementation requirements have started to get integrated into maritime's regulatory context. This paper focuses on cybersecurity in the maritime industry, presenting an inside view of maritime cybersecurity aspects and offering a detailed case study analysis based on a real-world company's approach. The main objective of the paper is, therefore, to connect research with practice, presenting a maritime company's cybersecurity systemic approach with references to procedures and policies. The findings of the case study and the cyber security vessel audit survey that is performed show that the company was able to assess its current status, collect evidence and objectively determine security gaps, and achieve cyber risks mitigation. The gained knowledge will be used in the future to continuously improve the company's systems and move to a more predictive and proactive maturity level. Cyberattack. Cybersecurity.

Cyber risk and cybersecurity: a systematic review of data availability. Cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy just under USD 1 trillion in 2020, indicating an increase of more than 50% since 2018. With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks. Cyber insurance.

Bayesian games for the cybersecurity of nuclear power plants. Many modern critical infrastructures are cyber–physical systems that rely on the integration of physical processes and computational resources. While this integration enables advanced system diagnostics, monitoring, and control, it also exposes the physical process to cyber-threats. Critical infrastructures such as nuclear power plants may be targeted by a variety of threat agents, each with unique motivations, resources, and capabilities. A Bayesian game-theoretic approach is presented to secure critical infrastructure when the adversary's characteristics are uncertain. In a Bayesian game, some players have incomplete information about the other players. Within the context of critical infrastructure cybersecurity, plant defenders have incomplete information about threat agents, and threat agents have incomplete information about plant defenders. A Bayesian game provides a quantitative method for security teams to identify optimal defense strategies. The Bayesian game-theoretic approach is demonstrated on the residual heat removal system of a boiling water reactor. Threat agents are modeled as types in the game using a threat agent library that defines each threat's characteristics. Similarly, different types of defenders are modeled by considering consequences of importance to plant stakeholders. Using these type definitions, utility functions are defined for each player. Nash equilibria of the Stackelberg game and two simultaneous games are identified and discussed. Using this procedure, a security team at a nuclear power plant can select the optimal strategy to defend the plant from cyber-threats. Cyber–physical systems. Game theory. Industrial control systems.

That's interesting: An examination of interest theory and self-determination in organisational cybersecurity training. With government and industry experiencing a critical shortage of trained cybersecurity professionals, organisations are spearheading various training programs to cultivate cybersecurity skills. With more people working from home and the existing cybersecurity staff shortages, cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting new and existing vulnerabilities by launching ubiquitous cyberattacks. This study focuses on how to close the gap in cybersecurity skills through interest cultivation and self-determined motivation. Our study shows that situational interest (SI) in cybersecurity along with situational motivational determinants (i.e., perceived learning autonomy and perceived relatedness) engendered self-determined motivation toward cybersecurity training. Consequently, self-determined motivation facilitated actual learning behaviour. Meanwhile, individual interest in cybersecurity created positive moderating effects in the relationships between self-determination and its key antecedents (i.e., perceived relatedness and situational interest). Based on these findings, we provide research implications accordingly. cybersecurity. motivation. self-determination theory. SETA. situational interest. 
Establishing a Cybersecurity Home Monitoring System for the Elderly. Many countries have increasingly aging populations. Many of these elderly people live alone and independently, but those suffering from chronic diseases or disabilities are at risk of accidents that will require assistance. Many commercially available homecare systems provide remote monitoring functionality, but these systems require someone on the other end of the remote connection to be paying attention. This raises the need for intelligent home monitoring systems to ensure continuous awareness of user safety. This article proposes a system using beacon technology to assess subject well being based on lack of movement, and automatically activates prepositioned cameras and send an alert to family members or caregivers in response to potentially high-risk activity, such as activating particular kitchen appliances. However, the use of such cameras raises privacy concerns. To improve object readability and privacy, our research uses federated learning to enhance the readability of fast regions with convolutional neural networks features (RCNN). The presented approach stores the personal information of the elderly in the local server, which avoids revealing their home information and secures the data transmission safety by privacy protection. The article has proved the feasibility and practicality by running the experiment. the system can genuinely operate in home health care.

The security economics of EdTech: vendors’ responsibility and the cybersecurity challenge in the education sector. Purpose: The education sector is increasingly targeted by malicious cyber incidents, resulting in huge financial losses, cancelation of classes and exams and large-scale breaches of students’ and staff’s data. This paper aims to investigate education technology (EdTech) vendors’ responsibility for this cyber (in)security challenge, with a particular focus on EdTech in India as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretically, building on the security economics literature, the paper establishes a link between the dynamics of the EdTech market and the education sector’s cyber insecurities and investigates the various economic barriers that stand in the way of improving EdTech vendors’ security practices. Empirically, the paper analyses publicly reported cyber incidents targeting the Indian education sector and EdTech companies in the past 10 years as published in newspapers, using the LexisNexis database. It also examines existing EdTech procurement challenges in India and elsewhere and develops a number of policy recommendations to address the misaligned incentives and information asymmetries between EdTech vendors and educational institutions. Findings: Market forces alone cannot create sufficient incentives for EdTech vendors to prioritise security in product design. Considering the infant stage of the EdTech industry, the lack of evidence about the efficacy of EdTech tools, the fragmentation in the EdTech market and the peculiarities of educational institutions as end-users, a regulatorily and policy intervention is needed to secure education through procurement processes. Originality/value: This paper introduces a novel exploration to the cybersecurity challenge in the education sector, an area of research and policy analysis that remains largely understudied. By adding a cybersecurity angle, the paper also contributes to the literature using a political economy approach in scrutinising EdTech. Cybersecurity. EdTech. India. K-12. Liability.

Banking Information Resource Cybersecurity System Modeling. The rapid development of the process of informatization of modern society has necessitated cybersecurity in all spheres of human activity, as the implementation of deliberate or unintentional influences on the information sphere by both external and internal sources can damage security and lead to moral, material, financial, reputational and other forms of damage. The purpose of the paper is to create functional cognitive models to assess the level of their protection. The method of building a fuzzy cognitive map of the state of cybersecurity of banks is used. There have been developed cognitive models to determine the level of protection of the computer network, information security system and critical infrastructure (banks). Scenarios have been developed that reflect the response of the system at the complex maximum attenuation of the impact of the most important cyber threats. In conclusion, the practical implementation of the method provides an opportunity to predict the state of cybersecurity of banks, and contributes to the implementation of the necessary mechanisms to prevent, protect and control access at the appropriate levels of network infrastructure. banking information resources. cyber threat. efficiency. hybrid threat.

An intelligent cybersecurity system for detecting fake news in social media websites. People worldwide suffer from fake news in many life aspects, healthcare, transportation, education, economics, and many others. Therefore, many researchers have considered seeking techniques for automatically detecting fake news in the last decade. The most popular news agencies use e-publishing on their websites. even websites can publish any news they want. However, thus before quotation any news from a website, there should be a close look at news resource ranking by using a trusted websites classifier, such as the website world rank, which reflects the repute of these websites. This paper uses the world rank of news websites as the main factor of news accuracy by using two widespread and trusted websites ranking. Moreover, a secondary factor is proposed to compute the news accuracy similarity by comparing the current news with fakes news and getting the possible news accuracy. Experiments results are conducted on several benchmark datasets. The results showed that the proposed method got promising results compared to other comparative methods in defining the news accuracy.
