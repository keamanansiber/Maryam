Cybersecurity in the food and beverage industry: A reference framework. Given the tendency of food companies to adopt digital technologies throughout the food supply chain and the importance assumed by the security and reliability of these systems in Industry 4.0 applications, we carried out a systematic literature review of cybersecurity issues in food and beverage industry. The research methodology was defined based on the PRISMA guidelines, and a reference framework was created that leveraged a thematic analysis of the following content categories: definitions, focus on the food and beverage industry, characterization of cybersecurity, and management of cybersecurity risks. This analysis allowed us to compare the advancement in cybersecurity in the food and beverage industry with those proposed in the literature for the Industry 4.0 paradigm. This comparison is useful, since although the Industry 4.0 paradigm finds a wide range of applications in such domain (e.g., Agriculture 4.0), the structural characteristics of this sector, its supply chain and products create a specific context and situations that may require ad hoc cybersecurity strategies and solutions. The body of knowledge on the food and beverage industry resulted mature in terms of definitions, the target supply chain, industrial assets, and cyber-threats, but requires future research effort in terms of practical analysis that can fill the emerging gaps in relation to risks, countermeasures, vulnerabilities, solutions and guidelines. The results of our review guided discussions, implications and definition of future research routes. Cybersecurity. Food and beverage. Industry 4.0. Systematic literature review. 
The role of cybersecurity and policy awareness in shifting employee compliance attitudes: Building supply chain capabilities. This paper investigates the role of general cybersecurity and cybersecurity policy awareness in enhancing supply chain cyber resilience reactive capabilities. Theorizing from the Protection Motivation Theory, 200 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were contacted to understand their perception of cybersecurity and policy awareness in affecting their overall cybersecurity hygiene. Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire survey and analysed via Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modelling to validate the research framework. Results of analysis outlined the importance of general cybersecurity and policy awareness in shifting employees’ compliance attitude towards enhancing supply chain reactive capability. Using a mixed-method approach, post-survey interviews were further conducted with practitioners in SMEs to understand the study findings. The implications outlined in this study emphasises the importance of prioritising preventive measures and proper employee cyber hygiene to address the risk and loss following a cyber-attack. Key supply chain operational areas in SMEs are still largely supported by the human workforce serving as its backbone. An unwarranted attack could cause adverse business impacts. Thus, practitioners and SMEs would be alerted to the critical need for a robust security posture and that SMEs’ need of the hour lies at the core of its policy and employee cybersecurity hygiene.

Cybersecurity strategy under uncertainties for an IoE environment. Internet of Everything (IoE) technology is increasingly being used by companies to modernize their activities. The very specific characteristics of such environments, in particular, their vulnerable exchanged data and the weak nature of the connected things, expose these companies to risks and security breaches. The principal objective of our work is to provide a cybersecurity strategy capable to consider all types of attacks that can affect an IoE environment while respecting the specified budget. For this purpose, a financial approach based on portfolio management is exploited by allowing to select a portfolio of security controls that minimizes the direct costs and maximizes the security level control. To be solved, the considered problem is assimilated to a combinatorial optimization technique and more precisely to that of the knapsack. We start by modeling the cybersecurity problem under cardinality and budget constraints that should be respected. To tackle the uncertainty of the problem, a robust optimization is used by considering the min-max criterion al-lowing to consider all the possible threats that can be generated by an attacker over the IoE environment. To solve the considered problem, we use a new iterative method under constraints and we compare it to the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) meta-heuristic to evaluate its performances. The obtained numeric results when evaluating the performances of the proposed strategy have shown its efficiency by finding efficient Pareto fronts for the two considered objective functions. Based on the iterative method, our strategy greatly outperforms the genetic algorithm by allowing good results for different problem sizes and respecting cardinality constraints in a reasonable time.

The Cultural Construction of Cybersecurity: Digital Threats and Dangerous Rhetoric [A Construção Cultural da Cibersegurança: Ameaças Digitais e Retórica Perigosa]. This article explores the contemporary construction of public culture around cybersecurity in the United States, using discourse analysis to critically examine the rise of militaristic rhetoric around digital threats in news reports and public statements by government officials and corporate experts. Cybersecurity has gone from being an obscure focus of tech and security experts to an issue of public concern. My approach advances theorizations of digital media and politics by bringing together insights from digital media studies and the anthropology of security to analyze how public culture around cybersecurity is being discursively constructed by authorities, and to advance theorizations of digital media and politics. Given the pervasive role of digital media in Americans’ lives, I contend that discourses that represent cybersecurity in terms of national security, equating hacking with cyberwar and cyberterrorism, contribute to the militarization of private civil and social life while failing to address wider vulnerabilities and threats to democracy associated with digital media.

The role of national cybersecurity strategies on the improvement of cybersecurity education. Digital information and telecommunication technologies have not only become essential to individuals’ daily lives but also to a nation's sustained economic growth, societal well-being, critical infrastructure resilience, and national security. Consequently, the protection of a nation's cyber sovereignty from malicious acts is a major concern. This signifies the importance of cybersecurity education in facilitating the creation of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem and in supporting cyber sovereignty. This study reviews a sample from world-leading countries National Cybersecurity Strategic Plans (NCSPs) and analyzes the associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement initiatives. Furthermore, a proposal to adopt the Goal-Question-Outcomes(GQO)+Strategies paradigm into cybersecurity education and training programs curricula improvement to national cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. The proposal maps cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies using the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework. The newly proposed cybersecurity education and training programs’ curricula learning outcomes were generated from the GQO+Strategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic goals: Development of secure digital and information technology infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats, and enrichment of individuals’ cybersecurity maturity and awareness. It is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program administrators utilize the proposed GQO+Strategies to align their program's curriculum to NCSP. Hence, closing the gap that exists with the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces. Cybersecurity curricula. Cybersecurity education. Cybersecurity strategic plan.

Cybersecurity education, awareness raising, and training initiatives: National level evidence-based results, challenges, and promise. This paper assesses the impact of cybersecurity education, awareness raising, and training (CEAT) on the vitality of internet use and services at the national level. CEAT encompasses one of five dimensions of a larger cybersecurity capacity building model (CMM) that was developed by the Global Cybersecurity Capacity Centre. The paper describes this dimension of capacity building within the CMM, and its indicators of education, awareness, and training in cybersecurity capacity. The paper then presents a cross-national analysis of the outcomes of CEAT on internet use based on comparative data from 80 nations. Controlling for contextual variables, such as the wealth of the nations and scale of internet use, the analysis shows a positive and statistically significant impact of CEAT on the vitality of internet use and services, as well as a distribution of CEAT scores that indicates key issues for low-income and developing nations. A qualitative analysis of responses from these nations is used to identify key reasons for their levels of maturity in this area. While recognising key limitations of these findings, it offers suggestions for policy and practice to meet the need for effective programs for education, awareness raising, and training. In addition, the research suggests the need for more detailed indicators of CEAT initiatives in more nations and over time to assess the validity of the findings and the recommendations for policy and practice in this area of capacity building offered in this paper.

An electric power digital twin for cyber security testing, research and education. Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) rely on communication and control technologies to efficiently manage devices in the system. However, a wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into integrated networks, including smart grid (SG). SG security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to train and test cyber attacks in a safe/controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying physical configuration and scalability. To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on SGs. The twin enable users to deploy real world attacks and countermeasures, and study its effectiveness. In the twin users may easily modify the components and configurations unlike in a physical test-bed. Further, reproducing the twin for advancing the research is significantly cheaper. We illustrate the typical use case with an example case study. Cyber Physical System. Digital twin. Security. Smartgrid. Test-bed. 
A new DDoS attacks intrusion detection model based on deep learning for cybersecurity. The data is exposed to many attacks during communication in the network environment. It is becoming increasingly essential to identify intrusions into network communications. Researchers use machine learning techniques to design effective intrusion detection systems. In this study, we proposed an intrusion detection system that includes preprocessing procedures and a deep learning model to detect DDoS attacks. For this purpose, various models based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have been evaluated in terms of detection performance and real-time performance. We tested the suggested model using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which is frequently used in the literature. We applied preprocess techniques such as feature elimination, random subset selection, feature selection, duplication removal, and normalization to the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. As a result, better recognition performance was obtained for the training and testing evaluations. According to the test results, 99.99% for binary and 99.30% for multiclass accuracy using the CNN-based inception like model gave the best results among the proposed models. Also, the inference time of the proposed model for various sizes of test data looks promising compared to baseline models with a smaller number of trainable parameters. The proposed IDS system, together with the preprocessing methods, provides better results when compared to state-of-the-art studies. Cloud security. Data preprocessing. DDoS. Deep learning.

Anomalous distributed traffic: Detecting cyber security attacks amongst microservices using graph convolutional networks. Currently, microservices are trending as the most popular software application design architecture. Software organisations are also being targeted by more cyber-attacks every day and newer security measures are in high demand. One available measure is the application of anomaly detection, which is defined as the discovery of irregular or unusual activity that occurs to a greater or lesser degree than normal occurrences in a data series. In this paper, we continue existing work where various real-world cyber-attacks are executed against a running microservices application, and the application traffic is logged and returned in the form of distributed traces. A Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network is used to model the set of distributed traces and learn the spatial and temporal dependencies of the application traffic. Subsequently, the model is used to make predictions for ongoing microservice activity and threshold-based anomaly detection is applied to detect irregular microservice activity indicating the presence of seeded cyber security attacks, or anomalies. The cyber-attacks used to evaluate this approach include a brute force attack, a batch registration of bot accounts and a distributed denial of service attack. Anomaly detection. Cyber security.

Enhancing cybersecurity by generating user-specific security policy through the formal modeling of user behavior. Organizations today are faced with the difficult challenge of balancing the embrace of new and emerging technology, and securing their systems and data that support critical business functions. Although there have been significant advances in security enforcement technology, attackers are still able to compromise organizations and access. The impacts of computer intrusions have become so untenable that many organizations are looking at a drastic rethinking of their approach to the security of internal networks. This approach is called Zero Trust and it seeks to remove all notion of a trusted internal network boundary. The benefits of Zero Trust include significantly increasing the work that attackers would need to perform to achieve their objectives. But Zero Trust will also increase the management complexity for internal security teams. These teams will need a way to collect data and enforce policy decisions based upon analysis. This process will need to be done for all organizational systems, and data, and it will need to be done in all access contexts. Our approach uses formal methods to model and examine end-users security-related behaviors. Researchers have found that the users’ security decisions correlate with factors including demographics, personality traits, decision-making styles, and risk-taking preferences. We describe these behaviors by using Finite-State Automata (FSA). This allows for the automated formulation of linear-time security properties based on Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL). The logic is then used to check the satisfaction of collected and observed security behaviors against policy. This formal behavioral analysis could be combined with other security and network data during the context analysis process that needs to occur for each Zero Trust access request. Other network or host security data could include address identifiers, tokens, event data, packet inspection, running process data, cyber threat intelligence, and much more. Our method allows organizations that embrace a Zero Trust philosophy to generate context specific security policies that can be automatically verified for correctness and completion.

A systematic synthesis of critical success factors for cybersecurity. Extant studies suggest that cybersecurity is critical and among the IT spending priorities of organizations. In response, the literature draws attention to the cybersecurity critical success factors (CSFs) that enable organizations to focus their scarce resources accordingly. Following a systematic literature review method, we analyze and synthesize extant CSF studies on cybersecurity implementation and management for organizations. Then, drawing on the synthesized CSFs and blending them with IT capability theory, we present an overarching cybersecurity CSF framework building upon 79 cybersecurity elements grouped into 11 CSFs under five dimensions of cybersecurity capability: organizational, infrastructural, strategic, process, and external. In addition, the descriptive analysis of the search results reveals the importance of the various factors and capabilities, the trend of the cybersecurity capability dimensions, the frequency and types of research methods, and the contextual impact of the factors. This research makes an important contribution to the literature on cybersecurity management. The CSF framework serves as the foundation for future researchers interested in measuring organizational cybersecurity success. In addition, practitioners can employ the synthesized CSFs and associated elements to guide their cybersecurity management. Critical success factors. Cybersecurity. IT capability theory.

A novel extended Internet of things (IoT) Cybersecurity protection based on adaptive deep learning prediction for industrial manufacturing applications. The use of the Internet of things (IoT) devices is growing rapidly in the current industrial market. Integrating these devices into the network system has subjected the information to Cybersecurity attacks putting the market of IoT technology at risk. As a result, accurate protection algorithms and efficient monitoring systems need to be developed. This paper proposes a new framework design relays on a stochastic measurement of determining parameters based on a novel adaptive deep learning (ADL) algorithm for industrial manufacturing such as transportation, energy. The new framework will be designed to incorporate an element of randomness as opposed to deterministic frameworks. The implemented method considered the network forensic systems and intrusion detection (ID). therefore, the prediction model is set up to alert the administrator about the system status. The framework is proposed based on five prioritized protection stages. The developed model tested on the Bot-IoT dataset, which is well-structured and valid for training, as confirmed by literature. The result has shown the ability to simulate the IoT network traffic along with risk assessment against different types of attacks by using the ADL algorithm. The new framework will be designed to improve computational efficiency by being able to adjust their structure based on the inputs. The research contributions are that it will help in the development of an algorithm which can minimize traffic accidents, improve traffic flow, minimize energy wastes, and save costs of controlling traffic flow. Findings show that using this new algorithm has 100% accuracy, which makes it an excellent choice for the detection of threats and errors. Deep learning. Industrial manufacturing.

Digital transformation of the maritime industry: A cybersecurity systemic approach. Information system solutions are increasingly being applied to the maritime industry, and eventually, all aspects of maritime operations will be aided by the digital transformation of the industry. The maritime industry is a sector driven by compliance and historically deals with security and safety matters at an international level. It has been recognized that safety and security in maritime heavily depend on cyber systems and cybersecurity implementation requirements have started to get integrated into maritime's regulatory context. This paper focuses on cybersecurity in the maritime industry, presenting an inside view of maritime cybersecurity aspects and offering a detailed case study analysis based on a real-world company's approach. The main objective of the paper is, therefore, to connect research with practice, presenting a maritime company's cybersecurity systemic approach with references to procedures and policies. The findings of the case study and the cyber security vessel audit survey that is performed show that the company was able to assess its current status, collect evidence and objectively determine security gaps, and achieve cyber risks mitigation. The gained knowledge will be used in the future to continuously improve the company's systems and move to a more predictive and proactive maturity level. Cyberattack. Cybersecurity.

Cyber risk and cybersecurity: a systematic review of data availability. Cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy just under USD 1 trillion in 2020, indicating an increase of more than 50% since 2018. With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks. Cyber insurance.

Bayesian games for the cybersecurity of nuclear power plants. Many modern critical infrastructures are cyber–physical systems that rely on the integration of physical processes and computational resources. While this integration enables advanced system diagnostics, monitoring, and control, it also exposes the physical process to cyber-threats. Critical infrastructures such as nuclear power plants may be targeted by a variety of threat agents, each with unique motivations, resources, and capabilities. A Bayesian game-theoretic approach is presented to secure critical infrastructure when the adversary's characteristics are uncertain. In a Bayesian game, some players have incomplete information about the other players. Within the context of critical infrastructure cybersecurity, plant defenders have incomplete information about threat agents, and threat agents have incomplete information about plant defenders. A Bayesian game provides a quantitative method for security teams to identify optimal defense strategies. The Bayesian game-theoretic approach is demonstrated on the residual heat removal system of a boiling water reactor. Threat agents are modeled as types in the game using a threat agent library that defines each threat's characteristics. Similarly, different types of defenders are modeled by considering consequences of importance to plant stakeholders. Using these type definitions, utility functions are defined for each player. Nash equilibria of the Stackelberg game and two simultaneous games are identified and discussed. Using this procedure, a security team at a nuclear power plant can select the optimal strategy to defend the plant from cyber-threats. Cyber–physical systems. Game theory. Industrial control systems.

That's interesting: An examination of interest theory and self-determination in organisational cybersecurity training. With government and industry experiencing a critical shortage of trained cybersecurity professionals, organisations are spearheading various training programs to cultivate cybersecurity skills. With more people working from home and the existing cybersecurity staff shortages, cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting new and existing vulnerabilities by launching ubiquitous cyberattacks. This study focuses on how to close the gap in cybersecurity skills through interest cultivation and self-determined motivation. Our study shows that situational interest (SI) in cybersecurity along with situational motivational determinants (i.e., perceived learning autonomy and perceived relatedness) engendered self-determined motivation toward cybersecurity training. Consequently, self-determined motivation facilitated actual learning behaviour. Meanwhile, individual interest in cybersecurity created positive moderating effects in the relationships between self-determination and its key antecedents (i.e., perceived relatedness and situational interest). Based on these findings, we provide research implications accordingly. cybersecurity. motivation. self-determination theory. SETA. situational interest. 
Establishing a Cybersecurity Home Monitoring System for the Elderly. Many countries have increasingly aging populations. Many of these elderly people live alone and independently, but those suffering from chronic diseases or disabilities are at risk of accidents that will require assistance. Many commercially available homecare systems provide remote monitoring functionality, but these systems require someone on the other end of the remote connection to be paying attention. This raises the need for intelligent home monitoring systems to ensure continuous awareness of user safety. This article proposes a system using beacon technology to assess subject well being based on lack of movement, and automatically activates prepositioned cameras and send an alert to family members or caregivers in response to potentially high-risk activity, such as activating particular kitchen appliances. However, the use of such cameras raises privacy concerns. To improve object readability and privacy, our research uses federated learning to enhance the readability of fast regions with convolutional neural networks features (RCNN). The presented approach stores the personal information of the elderly in the local server, which avoids revealing their home information and secures the data transmission safety by privacy protection. The article has proved the feasibility and practicality by running the experiment. the system can genuinely operate in home health care.

The security economics of EdTech: vendors’ responsibility and the cybersecurity challenge in the education sector. Purpose: The education sector is increasingly targeted by malicious cyber incidents, resulting in huge financial losses, cancelation of classes and exams and large-scale breaches of students’ and staff’s data. This paper aims to investigate education technology (EdTech) vendors’ responsibility for this cyber (in)security challenge, with a particular focus on EdTech in India as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretically, building on the security economics literature, the paper establishes a link between the dynamics of the EdTech market and the education sector’s cyber insecurities and investigates the various economic barriers that stand in the way of improving EdTech vendors’ security practices. Empirically, the paper analyses publicly reported cyber incidents targeting the Indian education sector and EdTech companies in the past 10 years as published in newspapers, using the LexisNexis database. It also examines existing EdTech procurement challenges in India and elsewhere and develops a number of policy recommendations to address the misaligned incentives and information asymmetries between EdTech vendors and educational institutions. Findings: Market forces alone cannot create sufficient incentives for EdTech vendors to prioritise security in product design. Considering the infant stage of the EdTech industry, the lack of evidence about the efficacy of EdTech tools, the fragmentation in the EdTech market and the peculiarities of educational institutions as end-users, a regulatorily and policy intervention is needed to secure education through procurement processes. Originality/value: This paper introduces a novel exploration to the cybersecurity challenge in the education sector, an area of research and policy analysis that remains largely understudied. By adding a cybersecurity angle, the paper also contributes to the literature using a political economy approach in scrutinising EdTech. Cybersecurity. EdTech. India. K-12. Liability.

Banking Information Resource Cybersecurity System Modeling. The rapid development of the process of informatization of modern society has necessitated cybersecurity in all spheres of human activity, as the implementation of deliberate or unintentional influences on the information sphere by both external and internal sources can damage security and lead to moral, material, financial, reputational and other forms of damage. The purpose of the paper is to create functional cognitive models to assess the level of their protection. The method of building a fuzzy cognitive map of the state of cybersecurity of banks is used. There have been developed cognitive models to determine the level of protection of the computer network, information security system and critical infrastructure (banks). Scenarios have been developed that reflect the response of the system at the complex maximum attenuation of the impact of the most important cyber threats. In conclusion, the practical implementation of the method provides an opportunity to predict the state of cybersecurity of banks, and contributes to the implementation of the necessary mechanisms to prevent, protect and control access at the appropriate levels of network infrastructure. banking information resources. cyber threat. efficiency. hybrid threat.

An intelligent cybersecurity system for detecting fake news in social media websites. People worldwide suffer from fake news in many life aspects, healthcare, transportation, education, economics, and many others. Therefore, many researchers have considered seeking techniques for automatically detecting fake news in the last decade. The most popular news agencies use e-publishing on their websites. even websites can publish any news they want. However, thus before quotation any news from a website, there should be a close look at news resource ranking by using a trusted websites classifier, such as the website world rank, which reflects the repute of these websites. This paper uses the world rank of news websites as the main factor of news accuracy by using two widespread and trusted websites ranking. Moreover, a secondary factor is proposed to compute the news accuracy similarity by comparing the current news with fakes news and getting the possible news accuracy. Experiments results are conducted on several benchmark datasets. The results showed that the proposed method got promising results compared to other comparative methods in defining the news accuracy.

In addition, the solutions proposed in this study includes that top technological figures, institutions and companies in Nigeria, Russia and the US need to put their cyber differences aside, move beyond the firewall protection approach and critically assess how data breach can be massively reduced if not avoided in its entirety. cyber-threat. industry 4.0. socioeconomic. sociopolitical. technological innovations. 
Recent Advances on Federated Learning for Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity for Federated Learning for Internet of Things. Decentralized paradigm in the field of cybersecurity and machine learning (ML) for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) has gained a lot of attention from the government, academia, and industries in recent years. Federated cybersecurity (FC) is regarded as a revolutionary concept to make the IoT safer and more efficient in the future. This emerging concept has the potential of detecting security threats, taking countermeasures, and limiting the spreading of threats over the IoT network system efficiently. An objective of cybersecurity is achieved by forming the federation of the learned and shared model on top of various participants. Federated learning (FL), which is regarded as a privacy-aware ML model, is particularly useful to secure the vulnerable IoT environment. In this article, we start with background and comparison of centralized learning, distributed on-site learning, and FL, which is then followed by a survey of the application of FL to cybersecurity for IoT. This survey primarily focuses on the security aspect but it also discusses several approaches that address the performance issues (e.g., accuracy, latency, resource constraint, and others) associated with FL, which may impact the security and overall performance of the IoT. To anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts, challenges, and research trends in this area. With this article, readers can have a more thorough understanding of FL for cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity for FL, different security attacks, and countermeasures. Cybersecurity.

A Cyber-Security Risk Assessment Methodology for Medical Imaging Devices: the Radiologists’ Perspective. Medical imaging devices (MIDs) are exposed to cyber-security threats. Currently, a comprehensive, efficient methodology dedicated to MID cyber-security risk assessment is lacking. We propose the Threat identification, ontology-based Likelihood, severity Decomposition, and Risk assessment (TLDR) methodology and demonstrate its feasibility and consistency with existing methodologies, while being more efficient, providing details regarding the severity components, and supporting organizational prioritization and customization. Using our methodology, the impact of 23 MIDs attacks (that were previously identified) was decomposed into six severity aspects. Four Radiology Medical Experts (RMEs) were asked to assess these six aspects for each attack. The TLDR methodology’s external consistency was demonstrated by calculating paired T-tests between TLDR severity assessments and those of existing methodologies (and between the respective overall risk assessments, using attack likelihood estimates by four healthcare cyber-security experts). the differences were insignificant, implying externally consistent risk assessment. The TLDR methodology’s internal consistency was evaluated by calculating the pairwise Spearman rank correlations between the severity assessments of different groups of two to four RMEs and each of their individual group members, showing that the correlations between the severity rankings, using the TLDR methodology, were significant (P < 0.05), demonstrating that the severity rankings were internally consistent for all groups of RMEs. Using existing methodologies, however, the internal correlations were insignificant for groups of less than four RMEs. Furthermore, compared to standard risk assessment techniques, the TLDR methodology is also sensitive to local radiologists’ preferences, supports a greater level of flexibility regarding risk prioritization, and produces more transparent risk assessments.

Methodology to Quantitatively Assess Impacts of 5G Telecommunications Cybersecurity Risk Scenarios on Dependent Connected Urban Transportation Systems. The fifth generation (5G) technology standard for cellular networks is currently being developed and is in the early stages of rollout across the United States. This upgrade from 4G LTE (long-term evolution) will not only have implications for the telecommunications network itself, but also on the many critical infrastructure systems that will use and depend on 5G for operations and functionality. Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology utilizes 5G and has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of the transportation system by allowing vehicles to communicate with one another and automating certain driving features. However, it is important to consider the risks that 5G brings, including cybersecurity risks, and how attacks through the 5G network can disrupt a traffic network that includes C-V2X technology. This paper presents a method to characterize the effects of several risk scenarios. Compared to prior qualitative risk assessments, outcomes include quantitative indicators measuring system safety and performance for analysis. The approach enables a more detailed and rigorous assessment of interdependent systems risks between the telecommunications and transportation networks than previously possible, particularly in the transition to 5G. A range of potential risk scenarios are assessed. The results show that cyberattacks that alter the behavior of vehicles cause delays across the entire network, cascading across the system and affecting more than just the vehicles directly targeted. The simulations show different levels of traffic delays and numbers of collisions for each risk scenario, indicating that the effects of a cyberattack can differ widely depending on the specifics of the attack. The simulation is easily adaptable to the location, C-V2X features, and risk scenarios of interest. Results provide information to formulate and prioritize risk mitigation strategies as the technology is developed to minimize the impacts of these attacks and system disruptions. Cascading effects.

Security beyond cybersecurity: side-channel attacks against non-cyber systems and their countermeasures. Side-channels are unintended pathways within target systems that leak internal information, exploitable via side-channel attack techniques that extract the target information, compromising the system’s security and privacy. Side-channel attacks are well established within the cybersecurity domain, and thus their cyber-physical systems are actively defended with countermeasures. Non-cyber systems are equally as vulnerable to side-channel attacks. however, this is largely unrecognised and therefore countermeasures to defend them are limited. This paper surveys side-channel attacks against non-cyber systems and investigates the consequent security and privacy ramifications. Side-channel attack techniques rely on respective side-channel properties in order to succeed. therefore, countermeasures that disrupt each side-channel property are identified, effectively thwarting the side-channel attack. This principle is captured within a countermeasure algorithm: a systematic and extensible approach to identifying candidate countermeasures for non-cyber systems. We validate the output of this process by showing how the candidate countermeasures could be applied in the context of each non-cyber system and in the real world. This work provides an extensible platform for translating cybersecurity-derived side-channel attack research into defending systems from non-cyber domains. Countermeasure. Cybersecurity.

Training a Quantum Annealing Based Restricted Boltzmann Machine on Cybersecurity Data. A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative model that could be used in effectively balancing a cybersecurity dataset because the synthetic data a RBM generates follows the probability distribution of the training data. RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques. Further, we show that synthetic data generated from a RBM can be used to balance the original dataset. Cybersecurity. D-Wave quantum computer. ISCX dataset. Machine learning. Quantum annealing.

Development of the cybersecurity scale (CS-S): Evidence of validity and reliability. This study aimed to develop a cybersecurity scale to measure individuals’ practices and perceptions regarding cybersecurity. The study tested psychometric properties of the Cybersecurity Scale (CS-S) by employing a multi-stage research design. In the first study, an Exploratory-Factor-Analysis (EFA) was conducted to explore the underlying factor structure and evaluate internal consistency reliability of the CS-S. The EFA results showed good internal consistency reliability (α =.88) and a six-factor structure. In the second study, a Confirmatory-Factor-Analysis (CFA) was conducted to verify the factor structure. The CFA results indicated that the six-factor model (i.e., confidentiality, control/possession, integrity, authenticity, availability, and utility) fits the data well. Significant individual differences were observed in each dimension of the CS-S. Results indicated that the CS-S has evidence of convergent, discriminant, and construct validity along with internal consistency reliability. The results suggested that the CS-S is a valid and reliable instrument to measure individuals’ cybersecurity practices and perceptions.

Investigating the accessibility and impacts of cybersecurity programs on high-school girls’ long-term industry engagement. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether having accessible cybersecurity programs (CPs) for high-school students affected girls’ long-term engagement with the industry, given that they already had interests in technology. Although much research has been done to evaluate how high-school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs retain girls in computing fields, it is necessary to see if this same long-term engagement exists in cybersecurity-specific programs. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 55 members were surveyed from the aspirations in computing community regarding their experience in and accessibility to high-school CPs. A quantitative analysis of such responses was then undertaken using inferential statistical tools and chi-squared tests for independence. Findings: The results showed that the existence of CPs alone are not influential factors in increasing long-term engagement with the field, showcasing that the high-knowledge barrier of CPs affects many students (even those with prior interests in technology). Instead, by having multiple occurrences of these programs and providing more cybersecurity resources to areas that lacked them, girls were more likely to report an increased interest in the field. Practical implications: Such information can support future program leaders to develop effective, accessible and more targeted cybersecurity initiatives for students of various communities. Originality/value: By analyzing the unique interactions of tech-aspiring women with cybersecurity, this exploration was able to demonstrate that women of different computing experiences face a shared barrier when entering the cybersecurity field. Likewise, in comparing these perspectives across different age groups, the investigation highlighted the development and subsequent growth of cybersecurity programming over the years and why such initiatives should be supported into the future.

ASSESSING AND REVIEWING OF CYBER-SECURITY THREATS, ATTACKS, MITIGATION TECHNIQUES IN IOT ENVIRONMENT. Despite Internet of Things (IoT) technology has a great potential to connect devices and sensors through communication media, such as Wi-Fi, to the internet and customized applications. However, it is vulnerable to cyber security attacks. Thus, integrating IoT technology requires attention to the increased cybersecurity threats. Based on above, this study has several objectives: (1) to review the common types of cybersecurity threats and attacks on IoT and (2) to review the suitable mitigation techniques for IOT threats and attacks. A systematic review has been conducted on 35 recent paper which have published in top ranking journal like IEEE, Elsevier and Springer. Based on our findings, which indicates that Jamming attack is the most common threats on the perception layer or sensors layer, and DoS/DDoS attacks are the most common method at the Network and Application layer. In addition, the results indicate that the most suitable mitigation technique for addressing the IOT attacks is the authentication technique. In addition, some of studies have been employed the AI methods to reduce IoT threats to reduce risks that cannot be addressed with traditional mitigation techniques. Finally, few of IOT studies used the blockchain technology for mitigating the cybersecurity threats and attacks in IOT environment. Attacks. Countermeasures. Cybersecurity. Internet of things(IoT).

Cybersecurity assessment of bim/cde design environment using cyber assessment framework. Digitalisation of the construction industry is exposing it to cybersecurity risks. All phases of construction can be affected. Particularly vulnerable are information-intensive phases such as building design and building operation. Construction is among the last industries that are discovering its cybersecurity risks and can rely on frameworks developed for other contexts. In this paper, we evaluate the cybersecurity risks of the design phase of construction using the Cyber Assessment Framework from the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) of the UK. The goal of this study is twofold. First, to examine cybersecurity risks themselves, and second, to evaluate the applicability of the NCSC framework for construction to see if and how construction is specific. The analysis shows that the cybersecurity risks follow the information impact curve that has been motivating the introduction of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The framework is applicable but is weak in addressing the specifics of the construction industrial ecosystem, which involves a multitude of dynamically connected actors, their overlapping authorities, and conflicting motives. It is suggested that a specialized constructionrelated framework should be developed. Building information modelling. Common data environment. Construction. Cybersecurity. Designing.

Analysis of Trending Topics and Text-based Channels of Information Delivery in Cybersecurity. Computer users are generally faced with difficulties in making correct security decisions. While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts from this grey literature can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by creating the patterns of the security knowledge gained from different sources. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts. Moreover, existing topic modelling methods are not capable of identifying the cybersecurity concepts completely and the generated topics considerably overlap. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive security categories to analyse trending topics. We further compare the identified 16 security categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several surprising findings as follows: (1) The impact reflected from cybersecurity texts strongly correlates with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes, (2) security blogs have produced the context of cybersecurity most intensively, and (3) websites deliver security information without caring about timeliness much. cybersecurity topics.

A Shared Two-way Cybersecurity Model for Enhancing Cloud Service Sharing for Distributed User Applications. Cloud services provide decentralized and pervasive access for resources to reduce the complex infrastructure requirements of the user. In decentralized service access, the implication of security is tedious to match the user requirements. Therefore, cloud services incorporate cybersecurity measures for administering standard resource access to users. In this paper, a shared two-way security model (STSM) is proposed to provide adaptable service security for the end-users. In this security model, a cooperative closed access session for information sharing between the cloud and end-user is designed with the help of cybersecurity features. This closed access provides less complex authentication for users and data that is capable of matching the verifications of the cloud services. A deep belief learning algorithm is used to differentiate the cooperative and non-cooperative secure sessions between the users and the cloud to ensure closed access throughout the data sharing time. The output of the belief network decides the actual session time between the user and the cloud, improving the span of the sharing session. Besides, the proposed model reduces false alarm, communication failures, under controlled complexity. Belief learning. cloud services. cybersecurity. service authentication. user verification.

Cyber-Security Threats and Side-Channel Attacks for Digital Agriculture. The invention of smart low-power devices and ubiquitous Internet connectivity have facilitated the shift of many labour-intensive jobs into the digital domain. The shortage of skilled workforce and the growing food demand have led the agriculture sector to adapt to the digital transformation. Smart sensors and systems are used to monitor crops, plants, the environment, water, soil moisture, and diseases. The transformation to digital agriculture would improve the quality and quantity of food for the ever-increasing human population. This paper discusses the security threats and vulnerabilities to digital agriculture, which are overlooked in other published articles. It also provides a comprehensive review of the side-channel attacks (SCA) specific to digital agriculture, which have not been explored previously. The paper also discusses the open research challenges and future directions. cryptography. digital agriculture. power analysis attack. security threats. side-channel attacks. smart agriculture. smart farming. vulnerability analysis. 
Enhancing Cyber Security of LoRaWAN Gateways under Adversarial Attacks. The Internet of Things (IoT) has disrupted the IT landscape drastically, and Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is one specification that enables these IoT devices to have access to the Internet. Former security analyses have suggested that the gateways in LoRaWAN in their current state are susceptible to a wide variety of malicious attacks, which can be notoriously difficult to mitigate since gateways are seen as obedient relays by design. These attacks, if not addressed, can cause malfunctions and loss of efficiency in the network traffic. As a solution to this unique problem, this paper presents a novel certificate authentication technique that enhances the cyber security of gateways in the LoRaWAN network. The proposed technique considers a public key infrastructure (PKI) solution that considers a two-tier certificate authority (CA) setup, such as a root-CA and intermediate-CA. This solution is promising, as the simulation results validate that about 66.67% of the packets that are arriving from an illegitimate gateway (GW) are discarded in our implemented secure and reliable solution. attacks. authentication. cybersecurity. gateway.

A Client-Centered Information Security and Cybersecurity Auditing Framework. Information security and cybersecurity management play a key role in modern enterprises. There is a plethora of standards, frameworks, and tools, ISO 27000 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework being two relevant families of international Information Security Management Standards (ISMSs). Globally, these standards are implemented by dedicated tools to collect and further analyze the information security auditing that is carried out in an enterprise. The overall goal of the auditing is to evaluate and mitigate the information security risk. The risk assessment is grounded by auditing processes, which examine and assess a list of predefined controls in a wide variety of subjects regarding cybersecurity and information security. For each control, a checklist of actions is applied and a set of corrective measures is proposed, in order to mitigate the flaws and to increase the level of compliance with the standard being used. The auditing process can apply different ISMSs in the same time frame. However, as these processes are time-consuming, involve on-site interventions, and imply specialized consulting teams, the methodology usually adopted by enterprises consists of applying a single ISMS and its existing tools and frameworks. This strategy brings overall less flexibility and diversity to the auditing process and, consequently, to the assessment results of the audited enterprise. In a broad sense, the auditing needs of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are different from large companies and do not fit with all the existing ISMSs’ frameworks, that is a set of controls of a particular ISMS is not suitable to be applied in an auditing process, in an SME. In this paper, we propose a generic and client-centered web-integrated cybersecurity auditing information system. The proposed system can be widely used in a myriad of auditing processes, as it is flexible and it can load a set of predefined controls’ checklist assessment and their corresponding mitigation tasks’ list. It was designed to meet both SMEs’ and large enterprises’ requirements and stores auditing and intervention-related data in a relational database. The information system was tested within an ISO 27001:2013 information security auditing project, in which fifty SMEs participated. The overall architecture and design are depicted and the global results are detailed in this paper. auditing. cybersecurity. information security. ISO 27001:2013. SME. 
Cybersecurity as illuminator for the future of computing research. Experts suggest that the role of cybersecurity in real-world systems, and the costs of its absence, are making the effects of these forces visible to the cybersecurity research community both clearly and early. Lessons being learned by cybersecurity researchers can help illuminate the path toward evolution of the larger computing research enterprise tomorrow. To explore this idea, experts outline several motivating forces we see at play and some lessons cybersecurity researchers are drawing from them. They then turn to the field more broadly, and propose a series of questions worth asking and exploring in that context.. 
Adaptive Blockchain Technology for a Cybersecurity Framework in IIoT. This article presents the problem regarding the assurance of the information that circulates in the devices that are connected to the internet, due to the multiple threats to which they are exposed, running the risk of losing or leaking information. However, with the passage of time, new technologies are emerging that encourage organizations to maintain continuous improvement of their applications and tools, but at the same time the emergence of new technologies brings with it cybersecurity risks that organizations must face when carrying out an integration with them. Therefore, through the action research methodology, two phases were defined, one of them reviewing Blockchain technologies and the second comparing Blockchain technologies to finally determine the most adaptable technology to a cybersecurity Framework focused on IIoT, capable of managing the integrity of the information and achieving a consensus among all the nodes belonging to a certain network.

Cybersecurity Resilience Maturity Assessment Model for Critical National Information Infrastructure. Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) that supports modern society is faced with constantly evolving threats due to inherent vulnerabilities and complex interlace of interdependencies. Thus, traditional approaches in protecting critical infrastructure can no longer suffice. Successful cyberattacks against CNII may have a debilitating impact on a nation due to cascading or common cause effects. Therefore, to ensure the continuous availability of CNII, the infrastructure must be prepared to be resilient to cyberattacks. Consequently, CNII organisations need to understand their cybersecurity maturity status and identify the gaps to aid improvement. Current approaches in gauging infrastructural resilience are qualitative and cannot quantify the degree of maturity. Thus, this article presents a Cybersecurity Resilience Measurement Model (CRMM) for quantitative assessment of CNII resilience maturity. Considering the effects of pre-event, during-event and post-event factors, the concept of CNII Resilience Quadrant (CNIIRQ) was developed for the comparative analysis of organisations. The CRMM was evaluated using data collected from 20 CNII organisations and it accurately gave the CNII Resilience Index. A grouping of CNIIRI of the organisations in CNIIRQ showed that 35% of them fall in Q4—a level of optimised resilience, 10% are in Q1, depicting an initial and weak resilience. Analysis of the Resilience Temporal Dimensions (RTDs) and Resilient Functions (RFs) revealed that while most of the organisations are prepared to resist attacks (pre-event), there is weak preparedness to respond to or recover from successful cyberattacks. The implication is that these organisations have gaps in during-event and post-event capabilities that need to be addressed. Critical national information infrastructure.

A hybrid encryption framework based on Rubik's cube for cancelable biometric cyber security applications. The need for high-speed and secure multi-biometric systems has grown in the last few decades. The progress in Internet applications and computer networks has prompted new problems with security and privacy. Having a reliable and secure means for storing biometrics is a necessary issue. Hence, data encryption and network security have become significant. Thence, because of the fast progress in network development, humans can easily and arbitrarily distribute or access digital data from networks. Therefore, ownership security has become a significant issue for individuals, and it requires much interest. Thus, there is a significant threat to copyright owners and digital multimedia producers to conserve multimedia from intruder prospection to avert loss in transmitted data. Ten years ago, most modern security systems depended on biometrics. Unfortunately, these systems have suffered for a long time from hacking trials. If the biometric databases have been hacked and stolen, the saved biometrics will be lost forever. Thus, there is a bad need to develop new cancelable biometric systems. In a classical authentication system, a user can easily change a password if it is compromised. However, the user's biometrics are limited and unique, and if a user biometric is compromised, it will be impossible to change it in a particular system or at least difficult. Cancelable biometrics can be generated with intentional, repeatable distortions of biometric signals based on transforms. Hence, biometric templates are compared in the transform domain. Cancelable biometrics depend on transforming data to replace a single biometric template in the same or different systems. This paper presents a cancelable biometric system that depends on a novel hybrid encryption framework based on the Rubik’ cube technique. It allows simultaneous encryption of multiple images. The suggested hybrid enrollment stage begins with chaotic Baker map permutation in the Cipher FeedBack (CFB) operation mode, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Ron's Code (RC6) algorithm as a first stage for encrypting the multiple images, separately. After that, the output encrypted images are passed to the second encryption stage via Rubik's cube technique. Chaotic, RC6, or AES encrypted face images are utilized as the Rubik's cube faces. For the RC6 and AES algorithms, they add a degree of diffusion, while the chaotic algorithm adds a degree of permutation. Moreover, the Rubik's cube technique adds more permutations to the encrypted images, simultaneously. The encrypted images are used in the cancelable biometric system. The simulation results prove that the hybrid proposed encryption framework is efficient. Moreover, it has strong robustness and security. AES. Cancelable biometric system. Chaotic. RC6. Rubik's cube.

Cyber security and the Leviathan. Dedicated cyber-security functions are common in commercial businesses, who are confronted by evolving and pervasive threats of data breaches and other perilous security events. Such businesses are enmeshed with the wider societies in which they operate. Using data gathered from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 15 Chief Information Security Officers, as well as six senior organisational leaders, we show that the work of political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, particularly Leviathan, offers a useful lens through which to understand the context of these functions and of cyber security in Western society. Our findings indicate that cyber security within these businesses demonstrates a number of Hobbesian features that are further implicated in, and provide significant benefits to, the wider Leviathan-esque state. These include the normalisation of intrusive controls, such as surveillance, and the stimulation of consumption. We conclude by suggesting implications for cyber-security practitioners, in particular, the reflexivity that these perspectives offer, as well as for businesses and other researchers.

E-commerce supply chains with considerations of cyber-security: Should governments play a role?. E-commerce supply chains and their members face risks from cyber-attacks. Consumers who purchase goods online also risk having their private information stolen. Thus, businesses are investing to improve cyber-security at a nontrivial cost. In this paper, we conduct a Stackelberg game-theoretical analysis. In the basic model, we first derive the equilibrium pricing and cyber-security level decisions in the e-commerce supply chain. Based on real-world practices, we then explore whether governments should impose cyber-security penalty schemes. Our findings show that when the government is characterized by having sufficiently high emphasis on consumer surplus, implementing the penalty scheme is beneficial to social welfare. Then, we extend the analysis to examine how adopting systems security enhancing technologies (such as blockchain) will affect the government's choice of imposing penalty. We uncover that when it is beneficial to have government's penalty scheme, the technology benefit-to-cost ratio is a critical factor that governs whether the optimal penalty will be lower or higher with the adoption of systems security enhancing technologies. To generate more insights, we conduct further analyses for various extended modeling cases (e.g., with alliance, competition, and the defense-level dependent penalty scheme) and find that our main results remain robust. One important insight we have uncovered in this study is that imposing government penalty schemes on cyber-security issues may do more harm than good. while once it is beneficial to implement, the government should charge the heaviest possible fine. This finding may explain why in the real world, governments basically always adopt a polarized strategy, that is, either do not impose penalty or impose a super heavy penalty, on cyber-security issues. blockchain technologies. cyber-security. e-commerce supply chains. government. social welfare. 
Modeling and executing cyber security exercise scenarios in cyber ranges. The skill shortage in global cybersecurity is a well-known problem. to overcome this issue, cyber ranges have been developed. These ranges provide a platform for conducting cybersecurity exercises. however, conducting such exercises is a complex process because they involve people with different skill sets for the scenario modeling, infrastructure preparation, dry run, execution, and evaluation. This process is very complex and inefficient in terms of time and resources. Moreover, the exercise infrastructure created in current cyber ranges does not reflect the dynamic environment of real-world systems and does not provide adaptability for changing requirements. To tackle these issues, we developed a system that can automate many tasks of the cybersecurity exercise life cycle. We used model-driven approaches to (1) model the roles of the different teams present in the cybersecurity exercises and (2) generate automation artifacts to execute their functions efficiently in an autonomous manner. By executing different team roles such as attackers and defenders, we can add friction in the environment, making it dynamic and realistic. We conducted case studies in the form of operational cybersecurity exercises involving national-level cybersecurity competitions and a university class setting in Norway to evaluate our developed system for its efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, and skill improvement of the exercise participants. In the right conditions, our proposed system could create a complex cybersecurity exercise infrastructure involving 400 nodes with customized vulnerabilities, emulated attackers, defenders, and traffic generators under 40 minutes. It provided a realistic environment for cybersecurity exercises and positively affected the exercise participants’ skill sets. Cyber range. Exercises. Modeling. Scenario. Security. 
Blockchain-based automated and robust cyber security management. We initiate the study on the problem of automated and robust Cyber Security Management (CSM). We exemplify the problem by investigating how CSM should respond to the discovery of cyber intelligence that identifies new attackers, victims, or defense capabilities. Given the complexity of CSM, we divide it into three classes, referred to as Network-centric (N-CSM), Tools-centric (T-CSM) and Application-centric (A-CSM). These lead to a range of functions for examining whether, and to what extent, a network has been compromised. Moreover, we propose to incorporate blockchain (via Hyperledger Fabric) to build a decentralized CSM system, dubbed B2CSM, that ensures the retrieval of valid invocation results for CSM purposes. We also integrate B2CSM with a decentralized storage network (DSN), instantiated by InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), to reduce on-chain storage costs without hindering its robustness. We present the design and implementation of the prototype B2CSM system. Experiments with real-world datasets show that the CSM solutions and system are effective and efficient. Blockchain.

Game-based learning platform to enhance cybersecurity education. Computer security competitions have been playing a significant role in encouraging students to get into cybersecurity, as well as enhancing the cybersecurity education system. The level of difficulty of the computer security tasks could be intimidating for most students and learners, one of the reasons there has been a shortage of cybersecurity professionals, in addition to that the lack of technical training and materials. The risks posed by the cyberattacks keep constantly evolving that positions the cybersecurity education as constantly changing area, which are at times hard to teach. Furthermore, the cybersecurity laboratories are hard to setup and the assessment tools are not accurate. This obviously impacts the proper engagement of students and the learning outcomes. To address these issues, we propose a game-based learning platform to enhance cybersecurity education. The platform applies an adapted ARCS motivational model to design and evaluate different challenges, it includes a virtual lab for students with the necessary tools for practice and a web portal where all challenges and learning materials are hosted. The aim is to help students learn at their own pace about different cybersecurity challenges, give them the opportunity to gain hacking skills with ethics taken in mind in a much safer environment. Learning by solving fun puzzles and playing educational games has a huge impact on students’ performances in cybersecurity. Although the contributed solution is developed for UAE University, we believe it imparts same gains in similar educational institutes. Competitions. Computer security. Cybersecurity. Education.

A cybersecurity assessment framework for virtual operational technology in power system automation. Assessment of cybersecurity in power system automation (PSA) requires a framework to study and analyze the complex relationships between the cyber-based control systems and power systems. A production system is not ideal or available for such assessment due to potential impacts and disruptions. In this paper,1 we propose a framework constituents of power system, process network, communication network, automation network, and enterprize network for cybersecurity assessment in PSA. Both real and virtual components supportability are incorporated in the framework for covering good enough functionalities of power systems maintaining hardware diversity and scalability. A specific instance of the proposed framework, Virtual Operational Technology Network (VOTNet), is presented explaining simulated and emulated systems such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), network devices, computing systems, software, and tools. The VOTNet consists of a centralized control center deployed with computing devices, an emulated communication network, a substation control center, and power systems. We evaluate and assess the VOTNet for cybersecurity and scalability issues and its cyber–physical impacts under different cyberattacks such as unauthorized access, denial of service (DoS), modbus protocol scanning and data reading, data manipulation/injection, and session hijacking. We also present risk assessment and mitigation against all the demonstrated attacks. Situational awareness and coordination under cyberattacks are also demonstrated. Finally, the usefulness of a virtual testbed in terms of different research applications and lessons learnt from its usage are also presented. Attack scenarios. Automation. Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity Awareness Enhancement: A Study of the Effects of Age and Gender of Thai Employees Associated with Phishing Attacks. Cybersecurity is crucial at present because cyber threats (e.g., phishing) have become a very common occurrence in everyday life. A literature review showed that there are no studies based on cybersecurity awareness which involved a large number of Thai users. Thus, this research focused on the cybersecurity awareness of approximately 20,000 nationwide employees in a large financial institution in Thailand. The study consisted of three phases, a first phishing attack, knowledge transfer through a mixed-approach and a second phishing attack with different content. After data validation and analysis of the results, it was found that the level of cybersecurity awareness of employees improved significantly. The number of employees who opened the phishing email decreased by 71.5%. Therefore, this approach could be applied to cybersecurity enhancement in other organizations and other sectors/industries. Also, it was found that gender played a significant role in cybersecurity awareness within the Thai cybersecurity ecosystem since Thai female employees were found to have a higher level of cybersecurity awareness than male employees. Furthermore, it was found that the different generations of Thai employees (Generations Y and X and Baby Boomers) did not affect cybersecurity awareness. Age. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity Awareness.

Federated Learning for Cybersecurity: Concepts, Challenges, and Future Directions. Federated learning (FL) is a recent development in artificial intelligence, which is typically based on the concept of decentralized data. As cyberattacks are frequently happening in the various applications deployed in real time, most industrialists are hesitating to move forward in adopting the technology of the Internet of Everything. This article aims to provide an extensive study on how FL could be utilized for providing better cybersecurity and prevent various cyberattacks in real time. We present an extensive survey of the various FL models currently developed by researchers for providing authentication, privacy, trust management, and attack detection. We also discuss few real-time use cases that have been deployed recently and how FL is adopted in them for preserving privacy of data and improving the performance of the system. Based on the study, we conclude this article with some prominent challenges and future directions on which the researchers can focus for adopting FL in real-time scenarios.

Leveraging human factors in cybersecurity: an integrated methodological approach. Computer and Information Security (CIS) is usually approached adopting a technology-centric viewpoint, where the human components of sociotechnical systems are generally considered as their weakest part, with little consideration for the end users’ cognitive characteristics, needs and motivations. This paper presents a holistic/Human Factors (HF) approach, where the individual, organisational and technological factors are investigated in pilot healthcare organisations to show how HF vulnerabilities may impact on cybersecurity risks. An overview of current challenges in relation to cybersecurity is first provided, followed by the presentation of an integrated top–down and bottom–up methodology using qualitative and quantitative research methods to assess the level of maturity of the pilot organisations with respect to their capability to face and tackle cyber threats and attacks. This approach adopts a user-centred perspective, involving both the organisations’ management and employees, The results show that a better cyber-security culture does not always correspond with more rule compliant behaviour. In addition, conflicts among cybersecurity rules and procedures may trigger human vulnerabilities. In conclusion, the integration of traditional technical solutions with guidelines to enhance CIS systems by leveraging HF in cybersecurity may lead to the adoption of non-technical countermeasures (such as user awareness) for a comprehensive and holistic way to manage cyber security in organisations.

Board Gender Diversity and Corporate Response to Cyber Risk: Evidence from Cybersecurity Related Disclosure. Cyber risk has become one of the greatest threats to firms in recent years. Accordingly, boards of directors must be continually vigilant about this danger. They have a duty to ensure that the companies adopt appropriate cybersecurity measures to manage the risk of cyber fraud. Boards should also ensure that the firm disclose material cyber risk and breaches. We examine how the board’s gender composition can influence the extent of such disclosure, based on a sample of the companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 Index over the period 2014–2018. Results show evidence of a positive association between the presence and level of cybersecurity disclosure and board gender diversity. However, the board must boast a critical mass of at least three women before this positive impact can be observed. Our findings contribute to the debate on the importance of gender diversity by adding the concept of the positive influence of heterogeneity on cyber disclosure. We also augment the literature on the critical mass of women in boardrooms by providing empirical evidence that three or more women constitute the threshold for better governance. Our study has important implications for investors, stakeholders and regulators. If investors wish to increase cybersecurity disclosure, they should ask for more diversified boards. Our findings support regulators in their efforts to increase women’s representation on boards by providing empirical evidence of better outcomes with this type of board composition.

MULTİ-CRİTERİAL OPTİMİZATİON COMPOSİTİON OF CYBER SECURİTY CİRCUİTS BASED ON GENETİC ALGORİTHM. The article proposes a method of multicriteria optimization (MCO) of costs for an information security system (SIS) of an informatization object (OBI). The technique is based on the use of the genetic algorithm (hereinafter GA) VEGA (Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm). The modified algorithm for solving the problem of multicriteria optimization of the parameters of the OBI multi-loop SIS allows substantiating the rational characteristics of the DSS components, taking into account the priority cybersecurity metrics of the OBI selected by the expert. Unlike the existing classical VEGA algorithm, the modified algorithm additionally applies the Pareto principle, as well as a new selection mechanism. Cybersecurity. Genetic Algorithm.

LEGAL, POLITICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS OF CYBERSECURITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. The main objective of the article is to present the development and the current situation with regard to political, legal and organizational aspects of cybersecurity in the European Union. The European Communities entered the information society era later than the US and Japan did. Following the Lisbon Strategy, however, the European Union has been developing it dynamically, and one of the main elements of these activities is cybersecurity. It has been increasingly a crucial point of safety of the whole virtual environment since the rising and such rapid development of information and communications technologies. The article presents a short history of the development of the information, digital and gigabit society in the European Union according to its subsequent long-term strategies, emphasising on the analysis of the development of European Union activities as regards cybersecurity in the political, legislative and organisational aspects. Some Polish threads are included, too. The paper is a result of a longstanding observation by the Author of the development of the information society in the European Union, is based on the EU’s official documents, national and international reports, visits, expert studies, and literature on the subject. The study shows that the activities implemented by the European Union are very often of a pioneering character on a world scale, apply system solutions, and are characterised by the logic of the sequence of endeavours made to ensure a high level of cybersecurity in its territory. These seem to be effective as shown by the high position of the European continent in cybersecurity rankings in the world . Cybersecurity. European union.

Cybersecurity Skills among European High-School Students: A New Approach in the Design of Sustainable Educational Development in Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity has increasingly become a headline feature in news media in recent years, generally prompted by spectacular security breaches in various information systems. The importance of cybersecurity awareness for the sustainable development of society is now recognized widely, but the problem of how to build an educational ecosystem which will include the most relevant target audiences that need to develop cybersecurity skills, is not yet solved. This paper elaborates the state of cybersecurity skills and knowledge in European high-school students by collecting data from the students, their teachers and parents by means of surveys and interviews in nine European countries. The analysis of the information collected has revealed the required topics from the area of cybersecurity that need to be introduced in high school educational programs and the most suitable delivery methods for educational content, such as videos and serious games. A selection of thirteen serious games related to cybersecurity was evaluated and then presented to a class of high-school students. The study of the collected data has shown that cybersecurity education at high school level requires innovative and interactive approaches that build the required skills for a more effective sustainable education and social development. cybersecurity. education. high-school level. serious games. sustainability. 
The Missing Case of Disinformation from the Cybersecurity Risk Continuum: A Comparative Assessment of Disinformation with Other Cyber Threats. This study examines the phenomenon of disinformation as a threat in the realm of cyber-security. We have analyzed multiple authoritative cybersecurity standards, manuals, handbooks, and literary works. We present the unanimous meaning and construct of the term cyber threat. Our results reveal that although their definitions are mostly consistent, most of them lack the inclusion of disinformation in their list/glossary of cyber threats. We then proceeded to dissect the phenomenon of disinformation through the lens of cyber threat epistemology. it displays the presence of the necessary elements required (i.e., threat agent, attack vector, target, impact, defense) for its appro-priate classification. To conjunct this, we have also included an in-depth comparative analysis of disinformation and its similar nature and characteristics with the prevailing and existing cyber threats. We, therefore, argue for its recommendation as an official and actual cyber threat. The sig-nificance of this paper, beyond the taxonomical correction it recommends, rests in the hope that it influences future policies and regulations in combatting disinformation and its propaganda. cyber threat. cybersecurity. disinformation. infodemic. information disorder. vulnerability. 
The Impact of Potential Risks on the Use of Exploitable Online Communities: The Case of South Korean Cyber-Security Communities. The aim of this study is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how risk and value factors affect the intention to use South Korean exploitable cyber-security communities based on the value-maximisation perspective of economics. According to the research model—applying the theory of planned behaviour, prospect theory and perceived risk theory—the test results revealed that intention is negatively affected by security threats, privacy concerns, performance risk and social risk of malicious use. Security threats had a positive impact on privacy concerns. The test results also indicated that perceived value affects both attitude and intention significantly and positively. The findings demonstrate that online-community users, such as computer experts and hackers, are influenced by various sources of perceived risks and perceived value when using exploitable cyber-security communities. cyber-security communities. cyber-security community. online hacker community. perceived risk theory. perceived value. prospect theory. theory of planned behaviour. 
Decision-Makers’ Understanding of Cyber-Security’s Systemic and Dynamic Complexity: Insights from a Board Game for Bank Managers. Cyber-security incidents show how difficult it is to make optimal strategic decisions in such a complex environment. Given that it is hard for researchers to observe organisations’ decision-making processes driving cyber-security strategy, we developed a board game that mimics this real-life environment and shows the challenges of decision-making. We observed cyber-security experts participating in the game. The results showed that decision-makers who performed poorly tended to employ heuristics, leading to fallacious decision approaches (overreaction strategies in place of proactive ones), and were not always aware of their poor performances. We advocate the need for decision support tools that capture this complex dynamic nature. banking cyber-security. cyber-security board game. cyber-security dynamics. cyber-security management. cyber-security training. system dynamics gamification. 
Institutional Strategies for Cybersecurity in Higher Education Institutions. Cybersecurity threats have grown exponentially, posing a heavy burden on organisations. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are particularly vulnerable, and their cybersecurity issues are receiving greater attention. However, existing research on cybersecurity has limited referencing value for HEI leaders and policy-makers because they are usually technology-focused. Publications that showcase best practices often lack system-wide perspectives towards cybersecurity in HEIs. Our paper, therefore, aims to bridge this literature gap and generate institutional cybersecurity strategies for HEI leaders and policy-makers from a system perspective. We first review how the cybersecurity landscape has evolved over the last few decades and its latest trends and projections for the next decade. By analysing these historical developments and new changes, we further illuminate the importance of strengthening HEI cybersecurity capacities. As we explore why HEIs face severe challenges to tackle the ever-escalating cyberattacks, we propose a system-wide approach to safeguard HEI cybersecurity and highlight the necessity to reassess prioritised areas. By taking an extensive literature review and desk research of methods that could respond to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of the next decade, we synthesise our findings with a set of institutional strategies, with takeaways designed to equip HEIs better to address cybersecurity threats into the future. The strategies include: (1) Strengthening Institutional Governance for Cybersecurity. (2) Revisiting Cybersecurity KPIs. (3) Explicating Cybersecurity Policies, Guidelines and Mechanisms. (4) Training and Cybersecurity Awareness Campaigns to Build Cybersecurity Culture. (5) Responding to AI-based Cyber-threats and Harnessing AI to Enhance Cybersecurity. (6) Introduction of New and More Sophisticated Security Measures. (7) Paying Attention to Mobile Devices Use, Using Encryption as a Daily Practice. and (8) Risk Management. We believe that cybersecurity can be safeguarded throughout the new decade when these strategies are considered thoroughly and with the concerted effort of relevant HEI stakeholders. cyber threats. cybersecurity. higher education.

Cost and Cybersecurity Challenges in the Commissioning of Microgrids in Critical Infrastructure: COGE Case Study. The application of microgrids in critical infrastructures has grown considerably due to the power supply reliability and resilience, and the island operation possibility of providing independence from the main grid. However, the necessity of intense information exchange between the devices that compose the microgrid to their proper operation, and the communication infrastructure required to realize that, makes the system vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. In this context, the case study presented in this paper raises two important subjects of discussion in the Brazilian electrical sector context, which are microgrids and cybersecurity in critical infrastructures of the electrical sector. Therefore, this paper presents the practical challenges related to these two subjects by reporting the development, implementation, and commissioning of a new microgrid controller, and the solutions found to accelerate the development by reducing costs, mitigating risks, and optimizing the commissioning time. cybersecurity. dispatched generation. hardware-in-the-loop. microgrid modeling. real-time simulation. risk mitigation. 
Collaboration or separation maximizing the partnership between a Gray hat hacker and an organization in a two-stage cybersecurity game. Vulnerability disclosure is a key topic in cybersecurity. It is a practice ensuring that organizations address and fix vulnerabilities before bad actors can find and exploit them. This study focuses on the disclose or exploit dilemma. It presents a two-player non-zero-sum simultaneous cyber-security game between a hacker and an organization at multiple rounds. The vulnerabilities classified as high, medium, and low are based on a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The hacker can decide to act separately or to collaborate with the organization. Subsequently, the organization chooses to operate individually or cooperate with the hacker. The organization also has a budget limit to patch the vulnerabilities. The paper developed an algorithm to determine the Nash equilibria of the game and conducted a numerical analysis. It found that maximum cooperation occurred at the beginning of the game when both the organization and the hacker decided to cooperate. 
Systematic Review on Identification and Prediction of Deep Learning‐Based Cyber Security Technology and Convergence Fields. Recently, as core technologies leading the fourth industrial revolution, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, the cloud, and big data, have promoted smart convergence across national socioeconomic infrastructures, cyber systems are expanding and becoming complex, and they are not effective in responding to cyber safety risks and threats using security technology solutions limited to a single system. Therefore, we developed cyber security technology that combines machine learning and AI technology to solve complex problems related to cyber safety. In this regard, this study aims to identify technology development trends to prevent the risks and threats of various cyber systems by monitoring major cyber security convergence fields and technologies through the symmetrical thesis and patent analysis. Because thesis information can explain the superiority of technology and patent information can explain the usefulness of a technology, they can be effectively used for analyzing and predicting technology development trends. Therefore, in this study, latent Dirichlet allocation is applied to extract text‐document‐based technical topics for the symmetrical thesis and patent information to identify security convergence fields and technologies for cyber safety. In addition, it elucidates cyber security convergence fields and technology trends by applying a dynamic topic model and long short‐term memory, which are useful for analyzing technological changes and predicting trends. Based on these results, cyber security administrators, system operators, and developers can effectively identify and respond to trends in related technologies to reduce threats, and companies and experts developing cyber security solutions can present a new security approach. cyber security. dynamic topic model (DTM). latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). long short‐term memory (LSTM). security convergence. technology prediction. 
Smart Cybersecurity Framework for IoT-Empowered Drones: Machine Learning Perspective. Drone advancements have ushered in new trends and possibilities in a variety of sectors, particularly for small-sized drones. Drones provide navigational interlocation services, which are made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT). Drone networks, on the other hand, are subject to privacy and security risks due to design flaws. To achieve the desired performance, it is necessary to create a protected network. The goal of the current study is to look at recent privacy and security concerns influencing the network of drones (NoD). The current research emphasizes the importance of a security-empowered drone network to prevent interception and intrusion. A hybrid ML technique of logistic regression and random forest is used for the purpose of classification of data instances for maximal efficacy. By incorporating sophisticated artificial-intelligence-inspired techniques into the framework of a NoD, the proposed technique mitigates cybersecurity vulnerabilities while making the NoD protected and secure. For validation purposes, the suggested technique is tested against a challenging dataset, registering enhanced performance results in terms of temporal efficacy (34.56 s), statistical measures (precision (97.68%), accuracy (98.58%), recall (98.59%), F-measure (99.01%), reliability (94.69%), and stability (0.73). drones.

Sustainable Digital Health Demands Cybersecurity Transformation. SUMMARY: Technology has become a mission-critical part of healthcare business operations. The electronic health record, medical equipment, revenue cycle, enterprise resource planning, marketing, legal, planning and building new facilities… every component today is dependent on automated tools. When computer systems go offline, everyone feels the stress of conducting business and delivering care without access to all the information they need. Downtimes are especially dangerous for patients.While there are many reasons that these systems go offline, cybersecurity breaches are primary culprits. Logically then, digital innovation becomes unsustainable in healthcare without cybersecurity transformation. What was good enough at one time is not acceptable anymore. As healthcare has accelerated toward digital dependence, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic, cybersecurity threats have also increased. The time to transform cybersecurity is now.The first thing for healthcare leaders to understand is this: You do not have a malware problem or a ransomware problem-you have a cybersecurity adversary problem. It is important to learn everything about the organizations attacking you, including their structure, motivation, and goals. Armed with those insights, you are more likely to be able to defend your health system. By transforming your cybersecurity program, you will build a foundation on which you can thrive as a modern healthcare operation. Copyright . 
ThreatSurf: A method for automated Threat Surface assessment in automotive cybersecurity engineering. Connected smart cars enable new attacks that may have serious consequences. Thus, the development of new cars must follow a cybersecurity engineering process including a Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). The attack surface assessment is a central aspect of a TARA. In this paper, we introduce a concrete approach for attack surface assessment following the steps asset identification, threat scenario identification, attack path analysis, and attack feasibility rating of a TARA compliant to ISO/SAE DIS 21434 and an approach to automatize them. We define a generic reference architecture and assets constituting the attack surface, attack building blocks with associated feasibility rating, and a method for automated generation and rating of attack paths using the attack building blocks and attack feasibility. Our exemplary application of the automated attack surface assessment on several threats from the UN regulation no. 155 shows the feasibility of our approach. Attack feasibility rating.

Cybersecurity as praxis and as a state: The EU law path towards acknowledgement of a new right to cybersecurity?. The end of the second decade of the 21st century has been the best of times for EU's cybersecurity law and policy: Its NIS Directive has been transposed into all Member States’ national law, creating a new administrative structure at EU and Member State level and mandating relevant policies and strategies to update and harmonise those that were already in place. Its Cybersecurity Act of 2019 incorporated the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and promises to install a new European cybersecurity certification scheme. To support policy with funding, large sums of research money have been spent on the development of cybersecurity tools and the relevant framework. However, EU's significant regulatory activity is faced with substantial difficulties. While cybersecurity concerns are placed high on the list of issues that worry Europeans making a regulatory response pressing, the cybersecurity theoretical framework is far from concluded: Difficulties start as early as when attempting to define the term, ultimately divulging a lack of common understanding. Different actors understand cybersecurity differently under different circumstances. A distinction that could perhaps prove useful in creating clarity as to its exact meaning would distinguish between cybersecurity as praxis and cybersecurity as a state. Cybersecurity as praxis would then be understood as the activities and measures that need to be undertaken in order to accomplish cybersecurity's aims and objectives. Accordingly, cybersecurity as a state would mean the condition that is achieved once cybersecurity as praxis has succeeded. Within cybersecurity as a state persons need to be protected against any cyber threat. A distinction between cybersecurity as praxis and cybersecurity as a state would not only be useful in delineating the term's content but could also constitute the necessary theoretical groundwork for development, ultimately, of a new right to cybersecurity. EU law has already taken positive steps towards acknowledgement of a new right to cybersecurity. However, a lot more needs to be done. Past progress needs to be continued and updated. A conceivable next step could take the form of formal acknowledgement of such a new right in EU law, in a future amendment of the Act's provisions or otherwise. 
Artificial intelligence, digital transformation and cybersecurity in the banking sector: A multi-stakeholder cognition-driven framework. Traditional banking institutions are currently under great pressure from their stakeholders to adapt to new technologies. However, due to this sector's inherent nature, data security cannot be jeopardized. Users must place great trust in their bank branches—a necessary feature of relationships between banking institutions and their clients. Banks’ reputation also directly affects their success, ability to attract new customers, and retention of existing ones. These issues mean that making decisions regarding how to deal with the challenges of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), digital transformation and cybersecurity into the banking sector is quite complex. This study sought to develop a realistic decision-support model by combining cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method in order to address this topic. Group sessions with an expert panel were conducted to apply the methodological procedures, thereby allowing realism to be incorporated into the final results. Artificial intelligence (AI).

Advancing the concept of cybersecurity as a public good. This paper presents an agent-based model of cybersecurity as a participatory public good. Ineffective cybersecurity measures pose serious threats and risks to the development and stability of information societies in the world. Various doctrines and thesis explore how this domain should be treated by the public and private stakeholders. One of these doctrines is cybersecurity as a public good. In this paper, we highlight divergent views about the type of cybersecurity as an economic good. Then, the paper proposes an agent-based simulation model of a repeated public goods game among a set of defenders that are in an uncertain environment with incomplete and imperfect information. In the model, defenders have a probability to choose contribution or being a free-rider, depending on their own preferences and facing with revealed preferences of other defenders. This model implements a utility maximization that applies to each individual, modeling the existence of free-riders, punishments, and interdependency of decisions under a polycentric governance structure. The results of this simulation model show that, over time, defenders update their preferences in reaction to the behavior of other defenders and the experience of cyber-attacks. They indicate a high level of contribution to the provision of cybersecurity as a public good and the effectiveness of decentralized punishment on increasing the contributions. The consistency of the pattern of our results across different empirical studies lends us some reassurance that our model behavior is in quantitative agreement with empirical macro-structures. Furthermore, implementation of a polycentric structure challenges all the relevant agents to take action, and provides more robust environment. Agent-based modeling. Collective actions.

Performance evaluation of IEC 61850 MMS messages under cybersecurity considerations. IEC 62351-4 standard is published to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities of IEC 61850 Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) messages. This standard includes a set of cipher suites that are recommended for securing MMS messages. However, these are only a set of recommendations. There is no work in the literature that implements them on an IEC 61850 MMS message and reports the performances. In order to fill this importance knowledge gap, this short communication reports results of implementing cipher suites recommended by IEC 62351-4 on IEC 61850 messages. In addition to implementation details, real message exchanges are demonstrated with lab experiments. Finally, changing certificate and message sizes are reported. The results show that cipher suite selection is critical as some suites have 29.67 % smaller certificate size than others. The novelty of this short communication is showing details of IEC 62351 application and relevant changes on message sizes and structures of IEC 61850 MMS messages. There is no similar work or publication showing such procedures and results. IEC 61850. IEC 62351-4. MMS message. Power system communication. Smart grid.

Changing the landscape of cybersecurity education in the EU: Will the new approach produce the required cybersecurity skills?. Recruiting, retaining, and maintaining sufficient numbers of cybersecurity professionals in the workplace is a constant battle, not only for the technical side of cybersecurity, but also for the overlooked area of non-technical, managerial-related jobs in the cyber sector. The problem is the lack of cybersecurity skills in the European labour force. This paper presents the results of a study carried out with the aim to identify how much the cybersecurity education system within the high-level educational institutions and the industrial sector meets the needs for graduate students to gain the required cybersecurity skills. The method applied in the study is based on data collected from surveys carried out by the European competence centres on cybersecurity and the European Cybersecurity organisation. The problem of common educational program accreditation in Europe is highlighted and discussed. The actions undertaken to improve the education in both sectors are described and the emerging educational landscape is commented. The main cybersecurity knowledge specified by the industrial needs is presented in the form of five knowledge pillars. The study’s findings show that there are missing topics in high-level institution’s cybersecurity programs and that that there is a need to re-shape the content of the courses provided by the professional education providers.

Bayesian Models Applied to Cyber Security Anomaly Detection Problems. Cyber security is an important concern for all individuals, organisations and governments globally. Cyber attacks have become more sophisticated, frequent and dangerous than ever, and traditional anomaly detection methods have been proved to be less effective when dealing with these new classes of cyber threats. In order to address this, both classical and Bayesian models offer a valid and innovative alternative to the traditional signature-based methods, motivating the increasing interest in statistical research that it has been observed in recent years. In this review, we provide a description of some typical cyber security challenges, typical types of data and statistical methods, paying special attention to Bayesian approaches for these problems. anomaly detection.

Core-level cybersecurity assurance using cloud-based adaptive machine learning techniques for manufacturing industry. Cybersecurity is the domain that ensures safeness in both individual system and overall network systems. The classification and learning approaches used in different machine learning (ML) techniques improve the protection of the cyber systems against various attacks. Techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NN), principle component analysis (PCA), and reinforcement learning (RL) are used against various cyber threats. Applying these techniques at the front-end services (either online or offline) makes less effect than back end process-level services of any computer system. The proposed work analyzes the benefits of implementing customized ML and deep learning (DL) techniques on the core of the operating system than application level services, which in effect increases the speed and correctness of attack detection. The core (kernel) of the operating system has the capability to extract all internal attributes of process and file systems. The kernel space security activities can be improved by proposed work where the process level attributes classified using ML and DL techniques. The cloud service helps in sharing of the kernel abilities of the system ensuring core level security. The following work uses recurrent NN (RNN), SVM, PCA, and RL for analyzing the system data collected using Process Explorer. This technique finds application in manufacturing domain where the systems are protected from the various attacks to secure the data of the manufacturing company. 
Cybersecurity capabilities for critical infrastructure resilience. Purpose: For many innovative organisations, Industry 4.0 paves the way for significant operational efficiencies, quality of goods and services and cost reductions. One of the ways to realise these benefits is to embark on digital transformation initiatives that may be summed up as the intelligent interconnectivity of people, processes, data and cyber-connected things. Sadly, this interconnectivity between the enterprise information technology (IT) and industrial control systems (ICS) environment introduces new attack surfaces for critical infrastructure (CI) operators. As a result of the ICS cybersecurity risk introduced by the interconnectivity between the enterprise IT and ICS networks, the purpose of this study is to identify the cybersecurity capabilities that CI operators must have to attain good cybersecurity resilience. Design/methodology/approach: A scoping literature review of best practice international CI protection frameworks, standards and guidelines were conducted. Similar cybersecurity practices from these frameworks, standards and guidelines were grouped together under a corresponding National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework (CF) practice. Practices that could not be categorised under any of the existing NIST CF practices were considered new insights, and therefore, additions. Findings: A CI cybersecurity capability framework comprising 29 capability domains (cybersecurity focus areas) was developed as an adaptation of the NIST CF with an added dimension. This added dimension emphasises cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) security. Each of the 29 cybersecurity capability domains is executed through various capabilities (cybersecurity processes and procedures). The study found that each cybersecurity capability can further be operationalised by a set of cybersecurity controls derived from various frameworks, standards and guidelines, such as COBIT®, CIS®, ISA/IEC 62443, ISO/IEC 27002 and NIST Special Publication 800-53. Practical implications: CI sectors are immediately able to adopt the CI cybersecurity capability framework to evaluate their levels of resilience against cyber-attacks, given new attack surfaces introduced by the interconnectivity of cyber-connected things between the enterprise and ICS levels. Originality/value: The authors present an added dimension to the NIST framework for CI cyber protection. In addition to emphasising cryptography, IoT and cloud computing security aspects, this added dimension highlights the need for an integrated approach to CI cybersecurity resilience instead of a piecemeal approach.

Cybersecurity educational games: a theoretical framework. Purpose: Computer games that teach cybersecurity concepts have been developed to help both individuals and organizations shore up their defence against cybercrimes. Evidence of the effectiveness of these games has been rather weak, however. This paper aims to guide the design and testing of more effective cybersecurity educational games by developing a theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature is conducted to explore the dependent variable of this research stream, learning outcomes and its relationship with four independent variables, game characteristics, game context, learning theory and user characteristics. Findings: The dependent variable can be measured by five learning outcomes: information, content, strategic knowledge, eagerness to learn/time spent and behavioral change. Game characteristics refer to features that contribute to a game’s usefulness, interactivity, playfulness or attractiveness. Game context pertains to factors that determine how a game is used, including the target audience, the skill involved and the story. Learning theory explains how learning takes place and can be classified as behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, social learning or constructivism. User characteristics including gender, age, computer experience, knowledge and perception, are attributes that can impact users’ susceptibility to cybercrimes and hence learning outcomes. Originality/value: The framework facilitates taking stock of past research and guiding future research. The use of the framework is illustrated in a critique of two research streams. Multiple research directions are discussed for continued research into the design and testing of next-generation cybersecurity computer games. Computer crime. Computer security. Computer-based learning. Cybercrime. Human behavior. Information security. Information security modeling. Information systems. Phishing. Serious games. Training. 
SEMMA-Based visual exploration of cyber security event [基于SEMMA的网络安全事件可视探索]. Nowadays,the feature of cyber-security can be extracted intuitively and the cyber-security situation can be perceived in all aspects through cyber-security visualization. However, macro control of the overall analysis process of cyber-security is still a research challenge. In this paper, a set of general cyber-security event analysis model is proposed combined with the cyber-security visualization and the classic SEMMA (sample-explore-modify-model-assess) analytic model in DM. In order to standardize the security event exploration analysis process, it divides the analysis process into several specific steps such as data processing, behavioral feature exploration, anomalous object localization, anomalous event description and behavioral pattern association analysis. Fuzzy C-Means is referenced in the analysis model to quantify host behavior and identify network asset structures in the process of feature exploration. PBNLD (protocol-based node link diagram), a new visual presentation, is presented to construct network communication model, which can enhance the rendering quality of massive scale of nodes. Guided by the security event analysis model, the cyber-security event visual exploration system is built for multi-source security log instance data. Network asset segmentation, network anomaly event extraction and attack event evolution are implemented through multi-views synergy and backtracking way. Experimental results prove the validity of the analytical model. Cyber-security visualization. Fuzzy C-means algorithm. Protocol-based node link diagram (PBNLD). SEMMA. 
Human Factors in Electronic Health Records Cybersecurity Breach: An Exploratory Analysis. The healthcare sector continues to be the industry suffering one of the highest costs of a data security breach. Healthcare lags behind other industries in cybersecurity preparedness despite advances in cybersecurity technologies. Technical safeguards to protect electronic health records must be combined with human behavioral interventions to promote a robust cybersecurity plan. Using data from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, we conducted an exploratory analysis of past data breaches in healthcare organizations from January 2015 to December 2020 to explore the extent to which human elements played a role in data security incidents. We found that a vast majority of health records were compromised due to poor human security. The mean number of records affected by a breach due to unintentional insider threats is more than twice that of breaches caused by malicious intent such as external cyberattacks and theft. Our findings also indicate that, on average, more patient records are compromised from falling for a phishing scam than any other reason. We argue that proper cybersecurity contingency plans in healthcare must include human behavioral interventions that go beyond technical controls.

A Methodology on Assessment of Cybersecurity Risk in Large-Scale Smart Grids. A smart grid (SG) is a new paradigm in power systems, which is a high value-added platform through real-time information sharing. However, SGs are exposed to cyber-attacks because of the structural characteristics. In a power system in which a real-time balance of supply and demand is essential, cyber-attacks directly lead to a power outage and cause a complex disaster leading to a secondary subordinate accident simultaneously. In this paper, the concept of cybersecurity risk is defined considering the structural characteristics of Large-Scale SGs and its evaluation method is proposed based on NERC CIP. The evaluation method quantifies the risk of information security by applying the related standards (SGSF-121-1-1) and analyzes the optimal power flow calculation, state of balanced power supply and demand and frequency stability to evaluate the robustness of large-scale intelligent power systems. This study may contribute toward finding the basis for optimal decision-making when establishing a cybersecurity contingency plan. Balanced Power Supply and Demand. Contingency Analysis.

A Hybrid Approach to Analyze Cybersecurity News Articles by Utilizing Information Extraction & Sentiment Analysis Methods. Cybersecurity is becoming indispensable for everyone and everything in the times of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. Every aspect of human society - be it political, financial, technological, or cultural - is affected by cyber-attacks or incidents in one way or another. Newspapers are an excellent source that perfectly captures this web of cybersecurity. By implementing various NLP techniques such as tf-idf, word embedding and sentiment analysis (SA) (machine learning method), this research will examine the cybersecurity-related articles from 18 major newspapers (English language online version) from six countries (three newspapers from each country) collected within one year from April 2018 till March 2019. The first objective is to extract the crucial events from each country, which we will achieve by our first step - 'information extraction.' The next objective is to find out what kind of sentiments those crucial issues garnered, which we will accomplish from our second step - 'SA.' SA of news articles would also help in understanding each 'nation's mood' on critical cybersecurity issues, which can aid decision-makers in charting new policies.

SCADA Cybersecurity Awareness and Teaching with Hardware-In-The-Loop Platforms. This article deals with SCADA cybersecurity awareness and teaching. We present two twin demonstrators based on the same technology: (i) WonderICS, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) demonstrator used for awareness demonstrations and (ii) G-ICS, a flexible lab used for students training and pentesting. Both are based on a common Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) technology which combines simulation, emulation and real devices to reproduce realistic industrial environments. Our solution simulates the physical process alongside real sensors and actuators, which are then connected with real industrial control devices using open-source electronic interface boards. Moreover, an innovative firmware emulation platform allows to run real devices’ firmwares taken from vendors’ websites without the need of the actual physical devices. After describing the architecture and implementation inner workings of our HIL platform, we explain what are the attack scenarios implemented on both platforms. These attacks scenarios allow us to conduct both demonstrations and teaching. We show how they are carried out and the feedback they get. Cybersecurity. Emulation. SCADA. Simulation. Testbeds. 
Factors Affecting Cybersecurity Awareness among University Students. One of the essential stages in increasing cyber security is implementing an effective security awareness program. This work studies the present level of security knowledge among Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University college students. A module was created to assist the students in becoming more informed. The main contribution of this work is an assessment of cybersecurity awareness among the university students based on three essential aspects: Password security, browser security, and social media. Numerous questions were designed and sent to them to evaluate their awareness. The current survey received as many as 450 responses with their answers. Various statistical analyses were applied to the responses, including the validity and reliability test, feasibility test of a variable, correlation test, multicollinearity test, multiple regression, and heteroskedasticity test, carried out using SPSS. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression model and coefficient of determination, a hypothesis test, ANOVA test, and a partial test using ANOVA were also carried out. The hypothesis investigated here concerns password security, browser security, and social media. The results of partial hypothesis testing using a t-test showed that the password security variable significantly affects cybersecurity awareness (p-value = 0.0001). The regression coefficient of the password security variable in the multiple linear regression model was found to have a beta value of 0.147. In addition, the browser security variable significantly affects awareness, with a p-value = 0.0001. The regression coefficient of the password security variable had a beta value of 0.188. The social media activities variable significantly affects cybersecurity awareness (p-value = 0.0001). The regression coefficient of the social media activities variable had a beta value of 0.241. Based on the research conducted, it is concluded that knowledge of password security, browser security, and social media activities significantly influences cybersecurity awareness in students. Overall, students have realized the importance of cybersecurity awareness. ANOVA. Browser security. Cybersecurity. Password security. Social media. SPSS. 
Changing the Paradigm of Control System Cybersecurity. Current cybersecurity protection relies on network monitoring. Changing the paradigm to monitor process sensors makes it practical to develop workable control system cybersecurity engineering solutions while simultaneously addressing reliability, safety, resilience, and productivity concerns. 
Framework and key technologies of digital twin system cyber security under perspective of bionics [仿生视角的数字孪生系统信息安全框架及技术]. In order to promote the transformation of industrial cyber security defense mode from static passive defense to active defense, and alleviate the contradiction between the serious shortage of security experts and the sharp increase of cyber security demands, a cyber security active defense system framework of digital twin system was built from the perspective of bionics, and then five kinds of key technologies focusing on active defense were proposed based on the digital twin security brain (DTSB), including security data interaction and systems collaborative defense based on cloud-edge collaboration, cyber security active defense model of parallel digital twin system, situation awareness of parallel digital twin systems based on digital twin security brain, active defense and control technical framework for digital twin system based on immune system, and anti-attack intelligent recognition of digital twin system based on artificial intelligence. A case study of a digital twin workshop was given to demonstrate the successful application of digital twin cyber security in smart manufacturing. Copyright . Active defense. Cyber security.

EE-ISAC—Practical Cybersecurity Solution for the Energy Sector. A recent survey of cybersecurity assessment methods proposed by the scientific community revealed that their practical adoption constitutes a great challenge. Further research that aimed at identifying the reasons for that situation demonstrated that several factors influence the applicability, including the documentation level of detail, the availability of supporting tools, and the continuity of support. This paper presents the European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (EE-ISAC)—a cybersecurity platform for the energy sector that has been adopted by multiple organisations. The platform facilitates sharing information about cybersecurity incidents, countermeasures, and assessment results. Prospectively, it is envisaged to be integrated with the threat intelligence platform that enables real-time situational awareness. By considering both fault and attack scenarios together, threat awareness can be mapped onto operational contexts to prioritise decisions and responses. This paper analyses EE-ISAC’s approach based on the conceptual applicability framework developed during the research, to improve the applicability and usefulness of this platform for energy sector participants and to identify areas that require further development. applicability. cybersecurity. information sharing. organisational management. situational awareness. threat intelligence. 
Cybersecurity in the GCC: From Economic Development to Geopolitical Controversy. While the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are not alone in their increasing exposure to the negative side effects of greater digital dependency, their status as technological leaders—not just in the region, but also in the world—means that they are vulnerable to a variety of cybersecurity threats. This article examines the trajectory of cybersecurity in the GCC states, exploring the main threats, the role of the GCC states in regional and international governance mechanisms, and the tensions between steps to achieve a more secure digital space on the one hand, and the privacy and human-rights risks of widespread surveillance on the other. The article argues that cybersecurity in the GCC follows a clear trajectory: beginning with economic drivers for securing a digital economy, cybersecurity organizations and policies then become entangled in geopolitical controversies, from the sale of surveillance technologies to superpower rivalry over AI and 5G communications. 
Data Protection and Cybersecurity Certification Activities and Schemes in the Energy Sector. Cybersecurity concerns have been at the forefront of regulatory reform in the European Union (EU) recently. One of the outcomes of these reforms is the introduction of certification schemes for information and communication technology (ICT) products, services and processes, as well as for data processing operations concerning personal data. These schemes aim to provide an avenue for consumers to assess the compliance posture of organisations concerning the privacy and security of ICT products, services and processes. They also present manufacturers, providers and data controllers with the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements through a verifiable third-party assessment. As these certification schemes are being developed, various sectors, including the electrical power and energy sector, will need to access the impact on their operations and plan towards successful implementation. Relying on a doctrinal method, this paper identifies relevant EU legal instruments on data protection and cybersecurity certification and their interpretation in order to examine their potential impact when applying certification schemes within the Electrical Power and Energy System (EPES) domain. The result suggests that the EPES domain employs different technologies and services from diverse areas, which can result in the application of several certification schemes within its environment, including horizontal, technological and sector-specific schemes. This has the potential for creating a complex constellation of implementation models and would require careful design to avoid proliferation and disincentivising of stakeholders. Certification.

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A DEVS-BASED CYBER-ATTACK SIMULATOR FOR CYBER SECURITY. The necessity of conducting business processes of institutions and individuals with information technologies has brought risks and threats. Cyber-attacks may lead to hard-to-recover results. Although many security systems have been developed against to these attacks, attacks and security breaches of information systems are increasing rapidly. In this study, it is aimed to understand the security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which is one of the most important issues at the point of providing cyber security, and to detect cyber-attacks. Using physical networks to test cyber-attack methods is a very costly and time consuming process. In this paper, as a different method, a cyber-attack simulation model has been developed using the DEVS modelling approach to simulate and test cyber-attack scenarios and evaluate the results. An application has been developed that simulates an attack scenario in a virtual network and evaluates detector alerts by generating appropriate intrusion detection system signals. The DEVS-Suite simulation environment was used as a development environment. Comparisons were made with different cyber-attack simulation applications and their differences were revealed.

The effects of antecedents and mediating factors on cybersecurity protection behavior. This paper identifies opportunities for potential theoretical and practical improvements in employees' awareness of cybersecurity and their motivational behavior to protect themselves and their organizations from cyberattacks using the protection motivation theory. In addition, it contributes to the literature by examining additional variables and mediators besides the core constructs of the Protection Motivation Model (PMT). This article uses empirical data and structural equation modeling to test the antecedents and mediators of employees' cybersecurity motivational behavior. The study offers theoretical and pragmatic guidance for cybersecurity programs. First, the model developed in this study can partially explain how people may change their cybersecurity protection behavior about security threats and coping actions. Secondly, the result of the study indicates that security coping factors are reliable predictors in projecting individual intention to take protective measures. Third, organizational effort in combatting cyber threats and increasing employee awareness is significantly associated with the use of cyber threat coping processes. Additionally, several practical prescriptions are suggested based on gender, generations, and types of organizations. For example, government organizations have taken well-designed cybersecurity measures and developed detailed protocols to enhance employees’ motivational behavior. Finally, future cybersecurity training materials should adapt to the unique traits of different generations, especially the Gen Edge group and digital natives for all cybersecurity subjects.

Adopting the cybersecurity concepts into curriculum: The potential effects on students' cybersecurity knowledge. This study examines the effect of adopting cybersecurity concepts on the information and technology (IT) curriculum and determines the potential effect on students' knowledge of cybersecurity practices and level of awareness. To this end, a pilot study was first conducted to measure the current level of cybersecurity awareness. The results revealed that students do not have much knowledge of cybersecurity. Thus, a four-step approach was proposed to infuse the relevant cybersecurity topics in five matched courses based on the latest cybersecurity curricular guidelines (CSEC2017). A sample of 42 students was selected purposively without prior knowledge of cybersecurity and divided identically into experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group were asked to take five consecutive courses over five semesters. In each course, groups went through a pre-test for the infused topics. Then, the experimental group taught the corresponding infused topics. A post-test was administered to both groups at the end of each course, and the t-test was conducted. The results found significant differences between marks of prior and post-tests for 11 out of 14 infused topics. These satisfactory results would encourage universities to infuse cybersecurity concepts into their curriculum. Curricular guidelines. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity awareness. Knowledge improvement.

Cybersecurity of multi-cloud healthcare systems: A hierarchical deep learning approach. With the increase in sophistication and connectedness of the healthcare networks, their attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase significantly. Malicious agents threaten patients’ health and life by stealing or altering data as it flows among the multiple domains of healthcare networks. The problem is likely to exacerbate with the increasing use of IoT devices, edge, and core clouds in the next generation healthcare networks. Presented in this paper is MUSE, a system of deep hierarchical stacked neural networks for timely and accurate detection of malicious activity that leads to alteration of meta-information or payload of the dataflow between the IoT gateway, edge and core clouds. Smaller models at the edge clouds take substantially less time to train as compared to the large models in the core cloud. To improve the speed of training and accuracy of detection of large core cloud models, the MUSE system uses a novel method of merging and aggregating layers of trained edge cloud models to construct a partly pre-trained core cloud model. As a result, the model in the core cloud takes substantially smaller number of epochs (6 to 8) and, consequently, less time, compared to those in the edge clouds, training of which take 35 to 40 epochs to converge. With the help of extensive evaluations, it is shown that with the MUSE system, large, merged models can be trained in significantly less time than the unmerged models that are created independently in the core cloud. Through several runs it is seen that the merged models give on an average 26.2% reduction in training times. From the experimental evaluation we demonstrate that along with fast training speeds the merged MUSE model gives high training and test accuracies, ranging from 95% to 100%, in detection of unknown attacks on dataflows. The merged model thus generalizes very well on the test data. This is a marked improvement when compared with the accuracy given by un-merged model as well as accuracy reported by other researchers with newer datasets. Cloud networks. Critical healthcare.

Application of cognitive computing in healthcare, cybersecurity, big data and IoT: A literature review. Human Intelligence is considered superior compared to Artificial Intelligence (AI) because of its ability to adapt faster to changes. Due to increasing data deluge, it is cumbersome for humans to analyse the vast amount of data and hence AI systems are in demand in today's world. However, these AI systems lack self-awareness, social skills, multitasking and faster adaptability. Cognitive Computing (CC), a subset of AI, acts as an effective solution in solving these challenges by serving as an important driver for knowledge-rich automation work. Knowing the latest research and state of the art in CC is one of the initial steps needed for researchers to make progress in this front. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of prior research in the CC domain along with the challenges, solutions and future research directions. Specifically, CC-based techniques solving real-world problems in four widely-researched application areas, namely, healthcare, cybersecurity, big data and IoT, have been reviewed in detail and the open research issues are discussed.

Lost in privacy? Online privacy from a cybersecurity expert perspective. Research on the privacy paradox shows that ICT users have serious concerns about their online privacy but often do not behave accordingly. Most insights, however, are based on research among lay users. It is unclear whether users with high expertise on online privacy and cybersecurity would show similar discrepancies between concerns and behavior. We therefore interviewed 20 privacy and cybersecurity experts about their views on online privacy regarding mobile apps. Despite their technical knowledge, results showed that the experts’ perceptions and reported behaviors resembled those of lay users. A lack of specialized knowledge therefore does not seem to be a plausible explanation for the privacy paradox among mobile app users. Experts. Mobile apps. Online behavior. Privacy paradox.

Effectiveness of cybersecurity audit. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of internal audit of cybersecurity. We developed a Cybersecurity Audit Index composed of three dimensions – planning, performing and reporting – to address this question. We hypothesize that cybersecurity audit effectiveness is positively related to cyber risk management maturity and negatively to the probability of a successful cyber attack. We tested our hypotheses in a survey with auditors and Chief Audit Executives from various countries and industries. We found that Cybersecurity Audit Index scores significantly vary, with a mean of 58 on a scale from 0 to 100. While the planning and performing phases are strongly and positively correlated, they are less strongly related to reporting about cyber risk management effectiveness to the Board of Directors. As predicted, the Cybersecurity Audit Index is positively associated with maturity, but contrary to expectations, it is not related to the probability of a successful cyber attack. This is the first paper that comprehensively measures the effectiveness of cybersecurity audit and its effects on cyber risk management. Assurance. Cybersecurity. Index. Internal audit. Maturity. 
Strategic roles of IT modernization and cloud migration in reducing cybersecurity risks of organizations: The case of U.S. federal government. Many organizations run their core business operations on decades-old legacy IT systems. Some security professionals argue that legacy IT systems significantly increase security risks because they are not designed to address contemporary cybersecurity risks. Others counter that the legacy systems might be secure by antiquity and argue that due to lack of adequate documentation on the systems, it is very difficult for potential attackers to discover and exploit security vulnerabilities. There is a shortage of empirical evidence on either argument. Routine activity theory (RAT) argues that an organization's guardianship is critical for reducing security incidents. However, RAT does not well explain how organizations might guard against security risks of legacy IT systems. We theorize that organizations can enhance their guardianship by either modernizing their legacy IT systems in-house or by outsourcing them to cloud vendors. With datasets from the U.S. federal agencies, we find that agencies that have more legacy IT systems experience more frequent security incidents than others with more modern IT systems. A 1%-point increase in the proportion of IT budgets spent on IT modernization is associated with a 5.6% decrease in the number of security incidents. Furthermore, migration of the legacy systems to the cloud is negatively associated with the number of security incidents. The findings advance the literature on strategic information systems by extending RAT to explain why the security by antiquity argument is not valid and how organizations can reduce the security risks of legacy IT systems through modernization and migration to the cloud.

Multifractal Characterization of Distribution Synchrophasors for Cybersecurity Defense of Smart Grids. 'Source ID Mix' spoofing emerged as a new type of cyber-attack on Distribution Synchrophasors (DS) where adversaries have the capability to swap the source information of DS without changing the measurement values. Accurate detection of such a highly-deceptive attack is a challenging task especially when the spoofing attack happens on short fragments of DS recorded within a relatively small geographical scale. This letter proposes an effective approach to detect this cyber-attack by realizing the multifractal characteristics of DS measurements. First, the multifractal cross-correlation of DS measured at multiple intra-state locations is revealed. Then the derived correlation is integrated with weighted two-dimensional multifractal surface interpolation to reconstruct quasi high-resolution signals. Finally, informative location-specific signatures are extracted from the high-resolution DS and they are integrated with advanced machine learning techniques for source authentication. Experiments using the real-life DS are performed to verify the proposed method. cyber-physical security. distribution network. OT security. phasor measurement unit (PMU). Source ID Mix. 
The spillover effect of focal firms’ cybersecurity breaches on rivals and the role of the CIO: Evidence from stock trading volume. This study investigates whether there is any spillover uncertainty regarding a rival firm's future operations upon a focal firm's announcement of cybersecurity breaches and whether the existence of a chief information officer (CIO) in rival firms can reduce this spillover uncertainty. Using abnormal trading volume to capture the change in investors’ expectations, we show that compared with the focal firms, rival firms experience an increase in abnormal trading volume following the focal firm's announcement of a security breach. The findings suggest that the spillover effect generates even more uncertainties toward these nonbreached rival firms regarding the impact of the focal firm's security breach. However, CIOs in nonbreached rival firms can play a shielding role in mitigating such effects. Our study contributes to the literature on the impact of cybersecurity and has policy implications for encouraging a strategic perspective when managing cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity breach.

Deep Learning Based Attack Detection for Cyber-Physical System Cybersecurity: A Survey. With the booming of cyber attacks and cyber criminals against cyber-physical systems (CPSs), detecting these attacks remains challenging. It might be the worst of times, but it might be the best of times because of opportunities brought by machine learning (ML), in particular deep learning (DL). In general, DL delivers superior performance to ML because of its layered setting and its effective algorithm for extract useful information from training data. DL models are adopted quickly to cyber attacks against CPS systems. In this survey, a holistic view of recently proposed DL solutions is provided to cyber attack detection in the CPS context. A six-step DL driven methodology is provided to summarize and analyze the surveyed literature for applying DL methods to detect cyber attacks against CPS systems. The methodology includes CPS scenario analysis, cyber attack identification, ML problem formulation, DL model customization, data acquisition for training, and performance evaluation. The reviewed works indicate great potential to detect cyber attacks against CPS through DL modules. Moreover, excellent performance is achieved partly because of several high-quality datasets that are readily available for public use. Furthermore, challenges, opportunities, and research trends are pointed out for future research. Cyber-physical system. cybersecurity. deep learning. intrusion detection. pattern classification. 
Business, Organisational and governance modalities of collaborative cybersecurity networks. Countering advanced cyber threats requires investments in awareness and qualified personnel, as well as advanced technological solutions. Very few companies have the competencies and capacity to attempt to provide comprehensive solutions and sustain the technological drive and skill levels. Novel organisational solutions are needed to deliver advantages vis-à-vis both threat actors and competitors. The European Union sees one potential solution in the establishment of a network of cybersecurity competence centres. Starting in the beginning of the centuy, the creation of collaborative networked organisations in other fields demonstrated significant benefits in sharing knowledge, resources, and risk to exploit quickly emerging market opportunities. The major challenge in creating networked organisations is to provide long-term, effective collaboration through adequate governance and management. To support the elaboration of a solid governance model of a cybersecurity competence network in a Horizon 2020 research project, this article presents the results of a study of 92 existing network organisations working in cybersecurity and closely related fields. It presents the implemented methodological approach, the identification of main types of business models depending on funding streams and the degree of coordination among partners, organisational modalities, and prevailing governance models depending on member representation on senior governance bodies.

Municipal Cybersecurity: More Work Needs to be Done. As governments have digitized their operations, they have opened themselves to cyberattacks, resulting in harmful disruptions to government services. The scholarly world has been slow to pick up on this growing risk. Professional associations have conducted studies of their own, and produced recommendations, but few scholars have looked closely at cybersecurity practices at the municipal level. The interconnectedness of local infrastructure—across and among agencies and levels of government—makes it hard to figure out what is happening. In this paper, we urge scholars from multiple disciplines to examine the dangers created by the cross-linkages that characterize local cybersecurity. We examine the existing academic research, and demonstrate the significant growth in cybersecurity practice that has cropped up in spite of the relative sparsity of academic work. Theory and practice need to catch up with each other. cybersecurity. infrastructure@@. urban governance. 
Social network analysis of law information privacy protection of cybersecurity based on rough set theory. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem of information privacy and security of social users. Mobile internet and social network are more and more deeply integrated into people’s daily life, especially under the interaction of the fierce development momentum of the Internet of Things and diversified personalized services, more and more private information of social users is exposed to the network environment actively or unintentionally. In addition, a large amount of social network data not only brings more benefits to network application providers, but also provides motivation for malicious attackers. Therefore, under the social network environment, the research on the privacy protection of user information has great theoretical and practical significance. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, based on the social network analysis, combined with the attribute reduction idea of rough set theory, the generalized reduction concept based on multi-level rough set from the perspectives of positive region, information entropy and knowledge granularity of rough set theory were proposed. Furthermore, it was traversed on the basis of the hierarchical compatible granularity space of the original information system and the corresponding attribute values are coarsened. The selected test data sets were tested, and the experimental results were analyzed. Findings: The results showed that the algorithm can guarantee the anonymity requirement of data publishing and improve the effect of classification modeling on anonymous data in social network environment. Research limitations/implications: In the test and verification of privacy protection algorithm and privacy protection scheme, the efficiency of algorithm and scheme needs to be tested on a larger data scale. However, the data in this study are not enough. In the following research, more data will be used for testing and verification. Practical implications: In the context of social network, the hierarchical structure of data is introduced into rough set theory as domain knowledge by referring to human granulation cognitive mechanism, and rough set modeling for complex hierarchical data is studied for hierarchical data of decision table. The theoretical research results are applied to hierarchical decision rule mining and k-anonymous privacy protection data mining research, which enriches the connotation of rough set theory and has important theoretical and practical significance for further promoting the application of this theory. In addition, combined the theory of secure multi-party computing and the theory of attribute reduction in rough set, a privacy protection feature selection algorithm for multi-source decision table is proposed, which solves the privacy protection problem of feature selection in distributed environment. It provides a set of effective rough set feature selection method for privacy protection classification mining in distributed environment, which has practical application value for promoting the development of privacy protection data mining. Originality/value: In this study, the proposed algorithm and scheme can effectively protect the privacy of social network data, ensure the availability of social network graph structure and realize the need of both protection and sharing of user attributes and relational data.

Cyberattacks as state of exception reconceptualizing cybersecurity from prevention to surviving and accommodating. Purpose: This paper aims to outline how destructive communication exemplified by ransomware cyberattacks destroys the process of organization, causes a state of exception, and thus constitutes organization. The authors build on Agamben's state of exception and translate it into communicative constitution of organization (CCO) theory. Design/methodology/approach: A significant increase of cyberattacks have impacted organizations in recent times and laid organizations under siege. This conceptual research builds on illustrative cases chosen by positive deviance case selection (PDCS) of ransomware attacks. Findings: CCO theory focuses mainly on ordering characteristics of communication. The authors aim to complement this view with a perspective on destructive communication that destroys the process of organization. Based on illustrative cases, the authors conceptualize a process model of destructive CCO. Practical implications: The authors expand thoughts about a digital corporate immune system to question current offensive cybersecurity strategies of deterrence and promote resilience approaches instead. Originality/value: Informed by destructive communication of cyberattacks, this theory advancement supports arguments to include notions of disorder into CCO theory. Furthermore, the paper explains where disruptions like cyberattacks may trigger sensemaking and change to preserve stability. Finally, a novel definition of ‘destructive CCO’ is provided: Destructive Communication Constitutes Organization by disrupting and destroying its site and surface while triggering sensemaking and becoming part of sensemaking itself.

A Cybersecurity Culture Survey Targeting Healthcare Critical Infrastructures. Recent studies report that cybersecurity breaches noticed in hospitals are associated with low levels of personnel’s cybersecurity awareness. This work aims to assess the cybersecurity culture in healthcare institutions from middle‐ to low‐income EU countries. The evaluation process was designed and performed via anonymous online surveys targeting individually ICT (internet and communication technology) departments and healthcare professionals. The study was conducted in 2019 for a health region in Greece, with a significant number of hospitals and health centers, a large hospital in Portugal, and a medical clinic in Romania, with 53.6% and 6.71% response rates for the ICT and healthcare professionals, respectively. Its findings indicate the necessity of establishing individual cybersecurity departments to monitor assets and attitudes while underlying the importance of continuous security awareness training programs. The analysis of our results assists in comprehending the countermeasures, which have been implemented in the healthcare institutions, and consequently enhancing cybersecurity defense, while reducing the risk surface.

Metaphor identification in cybersecurity texts: a lightweight linguistic approach. The use of metaphor in cybersecurity discourse has become a topic of interest because of its ability to aid communication about abstract security concepts. In this paper, we borrow from existing metaphor identification algorithms and general theories to create a lightweight metaphor identification algorithm, which uses only one external source of knowledge. The algorithm also introduces a real time corpus builder for extracting collocates. this is, identifying words that appear together more frequently than chance. We implement several variations of the introduced algorithm and empirically evaluate the output using the TroFi dataset, a de facto evaluation dataset in metaphor research. We find first, contrary to our expectation, that adding word sense disambiguation to our metaphor identification algorithm decreases its performance. Second, we find, that our lightweight algorithms perform comparably to their existing, more complex, counterparts. Finally, we present the results of several case studies to observe the utility of the algorithm for future research in linguistic metaphor identification in text related to cybersecurity texts and threats.

Development of Additive Fibonacci Generators with Improved Characteristics for Cybersecurity Needs. Pseudorandom sequence generation is used in many industries, including cryptographic information security devices, measurement technology, and communication systems. The purpose of the present work is to research additive Fibonacci generators (AFG) and modified AFG (MAFG) with modules p prime numbers, designed primarily for their hardware implementation. The known AFG and MAFG, as with any cryptographic generators of pseudorandom sequences, are used in arguments with tremendous values. At the same time, there are specific difficulties in defining of their statistical characteristics. In this regard, the following research methodologies were used in work: for each variant of AFG and MAFG, two models were created—abstract, which is not directly related to the circuit solution, and hardware, which corresponds to the proposed structure. for relatively small values of arguments, the identity of models was proved. the research of statistical characteristics, with large values of arguments, was carried out using an abstract model and static tests NIST. Proven identity of hardware and abstract models suggest that the principles laid down in the organization of AFG and MAFG structures with modules of prime numbers ensure their effective hardware implementation in compliance with all requirements for their statistical characteristics and the possibility of application in cryptographic information security devices.

The Disclosures of Information on Cybersecurity in Listed Companies in Latin America—Proposal for a Cybersecurity Disclosure Index. For the corporate sphere, cybersecurity becomes an inescapable business responsibility, and accountability becomes a way of providing trust and ensuring resilience against cyber risks and high-impact cyber threats. The purpose of this study was to create a disclosure index that allows analysis of the scope of the disclosure of voluntary and mandatory cybersecurity information. The content analysis technique used focuses on the examination and identification of the cybersecurity information revealed in the annual reports and the 20 F annual forms of the companies with the highest stock market prices in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru during the period of 2016–2020. Longitudinal analysis indicates an increase over time in the disclosures and scope of information. The findings highlight that the country with the highest related disclosure is Argentina. the most extensive disclosures are due to the financial sector. and the strategy dimension represents the greatest weight in the index score. The study provides a novel instrument for measuring the content of disclosure on cybersecurity that is applicable in any specific context. In this case, the scope of disclosure in Latin America—a region which, according to our research, does not have previous studies on the subject—is evaluated. Cybersecurity disclosure.

On the scalability of Big Data Cyber Security Analytics systems. Big Data Cyber Security Analytics (BDCA) systems use big data technologies (e.g., Apache Spark) to collect, store, and analyse a large volume of security event data for detecting cyber-attacks. The volume of digital data in general and security event data in specific is increasing exponentially. The velocity with which security event data is generated and fed into a BDCA system is unpredictable. Therefore, a BDCA system should be highly scalable to deal with the unpredictable increase/decrease in the velocity of security event data. However, there has been little effort to investigate the scalability of BDCA systems to identify and exploit the sources of scalability improvement. In this paper, we first investigate the scalability of a Spark-based BDCA system with default Spark settings. We then identify Spark configuration parameters (e.g., execution memory) that can significantly impact the scalability of a BDCA system. Based on the identified parameters, we finally propose a parameter-driven adaptation approach, SCALER, for optimizing a system's scalability. We have conducted a set of experiments by implementing a Spark-based BDCA system on a large-scale OpenStack cluster. We ran our experiments with four security datasets. We have found that (i) a BDCA system with default settings of Spark configuration parameters deviates from ideal scalability by 59.5% (ii) 9 out of 11 studied Spark configuration parameters significantly impact scalability and (iii) SCALER improves the BDCA system's scalability by 20.8% compared to the scalability with default Spark parameter setting. The findings of our study highlight the importance of exploring the parameter space of the underlying big data framework (e.g., Apache Spark) for scalable cyber security analytics. Adaptation.

Developing decision support for cybersecurity threat and incident managers. Cybersecurity threat and incident managers in large organizations, especially in the financial sector, are confronted more and more with an increase in volume and complexity of threats and incidents. At the same time, these managers have to deal with many internal processes and criteria, in addition to requirements from external parties, such as regulators that pose an additional challenge to handling threats and incidents. Little research has been carried out to understand to what extent decision support can aid these professionals in managing threats and incidents. The purpose of this research was to develop decision support for cybersecurity threat and incident managers in the financial sector. To this end, we carried out a cognitive task analysis and the first two phases of a cognitive work analysis, based on two rounds of in-depth interviews with ten professionals from three financial institutions. Our results show that decision support should address the problem of balancing the bigger picture with details. That is, being able to simultaneously keep the broader operational context in mind as well as adequately investigating, containing and remediating a cyberattack. In close consultation with the three financial institutions involved, we developed a critical-thinking memory aid that follows typical incident response process steps, but adds big picture elements and critical thinking steps. This should make cybersecurity threat and incident managers more aware of the broader operational implications of threats and incidents while keeping a critical mindset. Although a summative evaluation was beyond the scope of the present research, we conducted iterative formative evaluations of the memory aid that show its potential. Cognitive task analysis.

A conceptual system dynamics model for cybersecurity assessment of connected and autonomous vehicles. Emerging Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) technology have a ubiquitous communication framework. It poses security challenges in the form of cyber-attacks, prompting rigorous cybersecurity measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the anticipated cause-effect relationships and mechanisms of CAVs cybersecurity and the possible system behaviour, especially the unintended consequences. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model to analyse cybersecurity in the complex, uncertain deployment of CAVs. Specifically, the SD model integrates six critical avenues and maps their respective parameters that either trigger or mitigate cyber-attacks in the operation of CAVs using a systematic theoretical approach. These six avenues are: i) CAVs communication framework, ii) secured physical access, iii) human factors, iv) CAVs penetration, v) regulatory laws and policy framework, and iv) trust—across the CAVs-industry and among the public. Based on the conceptual model, various system archetypes are analysed. Fixes that Fail, in which the upsurge in hacker capability is the unintended natural result of technology maturity, requires continuous efforts to combat it. The primary mitigation steps are human behaviour analysis, knowledge of motivations and characteristics of CAVs cyber-attackers, CAVs users and Original Equipment Manufacturers education. Shifting the burden, where policymakers counter the perceived cyber threats of hackers by updating legislation that also reduces CAVs adaptation by imitations, indicated the need for calculated regulatory and policy intervention. The limits to success triggered by CAVs penetration increase the defended hacks to establish regulatory laws, improve trust, and develop more human analysis. However, it may also open up caveats for cyber-crimes and alert that CAVs deployment to be alignment with the intended goals for enhancing cybersecurity. The proposed model can support decision-making and training and stimulate the roadmap towards an optimized, self-regulating, and resilient cyber-safe CAV system. Cyber-safety. Driverless cars.

Modeling effective cybersecurity training frameworks: A delphi method-based study. Today, cybersecurity training is commonplace in both large companies and Small & Medium Enterprise (SME). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of many of the current training offerings is put into question by reports of increasing successful cyber-attacks. While a number of models for developing Cybersecurity (CS) training frameworks for industrial personnel or general audience have been proposed, these models often lack consideration for humans aspects of learning (cognitive abilities, learning styles, meta-cognition among others) during development. Additionally, the success of a CS training program highly depends on its ability to engage participants. To develop a CS training framework that is able to motivate participants, we must consider individual-specific factors that can affect the result of training, besides establishing optimal training delivery methods and assessment. For this, in this work we propose a CS training framework based on a revised version of the ADDIE model and more recent research personalised learning theory. The Delphi method was used to both develop and validate our decisions during the development of the training framework model. The results of the decision of the Delphi method have later been compared to recommendations in the literature to create the finalised framework. This work presents two major distinctions from other CS training frameworks models described in the literature. First, the developed model is strongly based in learning theory foundations and takes into consideration differences in learning styles, cognitive abilities and metacognition of individuals, to offer tailored solutions optimized for each group of employees and single individual. Second, the use of the Delphi method and the involvement of experts stakeholders from various sides of academia and industry gave a wide insight into current needs and recommendations for CS training, as well as formal validation for the final development.

Data-driven insight into the puzzle-based cybersecurity training. Puzzle-based training is a common type of hands-on activity accompanying formal and informal cybersecurity education, much like programming or other IT skills. However, there is a lack of tools to help the educators with the post-training data analysis. Through a visualization design study, we designed the Training Analysis Tool that supports learning analysis of a single hands-on session. It allows an in-depth trainee comparison and enables the identification of flaws in puzzle assignments. We also performed a qualitative evaluation with cybersecurity experts and students. The participants apprised the positive influence of the tool on their workflows. Our insights and recommendations could aid the design of future tools supporting educators, even beyond cyber security. Cybersecurity education. Design study. Hands-on training. Learning analytics.

AI-assisted Computer Network Operations testbed for Nature-Inspired Cyber Security based adaptive defense simulation and analysis. In the current ever-changing cybersecurity scenario, active cyber defense strategies are imperative. In this work, we present a standard testbed to measure the efficacy and efficiency of customized networks while analyzing various parameters during the active attack. The presented testbed can be used for analyzing the network behavior in presence of various types of attacks and can help in fine-tuning the proposed algorithm under observation. The proposed testbed will allow users to design, implement, and evaluate the active cyber defense mechanisms with good library support of nature-inspired and AI-based techniques. Network loads, number of clusters, types of home networks, and number of nodes in each cluster and network can be customized. While using the presented testbed and incorporating active-defense strategies on existing network architectures, users can also design and propose new network architectures for effective and safe operation. In this paper, we propose a unified and standard testbed for cyber defense strategy simulation and bench-marking, which would allow the users to investigate current approaches and compare them with others, while ultimately aiding in the selection of the best approach for a given network security situation. We have compared the network performance in difference scenarios namely, normal, under attack and under attack in presence of NICS-based adaptive defense mechanism and achieved stable experimental results. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed testbed is able to simulate the network conditions effectively with minimum efforts in network configuration. The simulation results of defense mechanisms verified on the proposed testbed got the improvement on almost 80 percent while increasing the turnaround time to 1–2 percent. The applicability of proposed testbed in modern technologies like Fog Computing and Edge Computing is also discussed in this paper. Adaptive cyber defense. Computer Network Operations. Cyber range.

Dangerous games: A literature review on cybersecurity investments. Cybersecurity has gained prominence in the decision-making of firms. Due to the increasing occurrences of threats in the cyberspace, investments in cybersecurity have become critical to mitigate the operational disruption of businesses. This paper surveys the theoretical literature on the firms' incentives to invest in cybersecurity. A taxonomy of the existing contributions is provided to frame them in a common reference scheme and a model is developed to encompass such contributions and discuss their main findings. Papers that investigate the investment problem of an isolated firm are distinguished from those that consider interdependent firms. In turn, interdependent cybersecurity is analyzed in three different contexts: (i) firms that operate their business via a common computer network, but are not competitors in the product market. (ii) firms that are competitors in the product market, but run their business using non-interconnected computer systems. (iii) firms that are competitors and rely on a common computer network. Finally, promising avenues for future research and policy implications are discussed. 
A Study of Cybersecurity Education Using a Present-Test-Practice-Assess Model. Contribution: Based on a previous exploratory study, this research further investigated learning mode contributions from simulations and live competitive activities compared to a traditional classroom, laboratory, and testing approach to instruction in order to assess the applied behavioral contributions of each. Background: Cybersecurity capabilities in organizations lag behind the threats. consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity education. However, education appears to lack its full potential in most settings. Few empirical studies have systematically tested the efficacy of various training methods and modes, and those that have been conducted have yielded inconsistent findings. Recent literature on the use of gamified simulations have suggested that they may improve cybersecurity behaviors. Similarly, live activities, such as hackathons and capture the flag events, have been surmised to augment learning and capabilities. This study sought to systematically investigate this question. Research Questions: 1) Do cybersecurity simulations improve applied learning performance. 2) do live competitive activities improve applied learning performance. and 3) do any or each of these modes amplify applied learning performance when used in combination? Methodology: This study randomly assigned computer science students to one of four sections using different modalities. It used pretest scores on an applied exam as the co-variate, with post-test scores as the dependent variable. Results: Simulations improved learning performance over traditional classroom/lab instruction alone whereas live competitive activities did not. However, the greatest learning outcomes achieved was structured cybersecurity simulated environments combined with live competitive activities.

Cyber security threat modeling based on the MITRE Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix. Enterprise systems are growing in complexity, and the adoption of cloud and mobile services has greatly increased the attack surface. To proactively address these security issues in enterprise systems, this paper proposes a threat modeling language for enterprise security based on the MITRE Enterprise ATT&CK Matrix. It is designed using the Meta Attack Language framework and focuses on describing system assets, attack steps, defenses, and asset associations. The attack steps in the language represent adversary techniques as listed and described by MITRE. This entity-relationship model describes enterprise IT systems as a whole. by using available tools, the proposed language enables attack simulations on its system model instances. These simulations can be used to investigate security settings and architectural changes that might be implemented to secure the system more effectively. Our proposed language is tested with a number of unit and integration tests. This is visualized in the paper with two real cyber attacks modeled and simulated. Attack simulations.

A Parallel Control Framework of Analog Proportional Integral and Digital Model Predictive Controllers for Enhancing Power Converters Cybersecurity. Digital control endows power electronic converters with networking capability and makes them potential for the Internet of Energy (IoE). However, the IoE provides many interfaces for hackers and increases the risk of cybersecurity. To defend networked converters against cyberattacks, this article proposes a control framework where the digital model predictive controller (MPC) and the analog proportional integral controller (PIC) are physically connected in parallel. Due to such a parallel structure, once the converter is cyberattacked, the digital MPC can be physically isolated from the control loop, while the converter can still persist working under the dominating of only the analog PIC. In addition, the digital MPC and the analog PIC can compatibly operate under normal conditions to achieve excellent dynamic performances and zero steady-state error. The validity of the parallel control is verified on a buck converter as an example, and the control performances are also verified by experiments. Buck converter. cybersecurity.

Robotics cyber security: vulnerabilities, attacks, countermeasures, and recommendations. The recent digital revolution led robots to become integrated more than ever into different domains such as agricultural, medical, industrial, military, police (law enforcement), and logistics. Robots are devoted to serve, facilitate, and enhance the human life. However, many incidents have been occurring, leading to serious injuries and devastating impacts such as the unnecessary loss of human lives. Unintended accidents will always take place, but the ones caused by malicious attacks represent a very challenging issue. This includes maliciously hijacking and controlling robots and causing serious economic and financial losses. This paper reviews the main security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and their impacts, and the main security attacks within the robotics domain. In this context, different approaches and recommendations are presented in order to enhance and improve the security level of robotic systems such as multi-factor device/user authentication schemes, in addition to multi-factor cryptographic algorithms. We also review the recently presented security solutions for robotic systems. Counter-terrorism/insurgency. Countermeasures. Risk analysis. Robotics. Robotics against COVID-19. Security attacks.

Cybersecurity framework of hybrid watermarking and selective encryption for secure HEVC communication. Recently, the digital multimedia cybersecurity has become a research topic of interest due to the fast development of real-time multimedia applications over public networks such as the Internet. Therefore, this research paper introduces an efficient cybersecurity framework for protecting the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) frames. The suggested selective cybersecurity HEVC framework employs a robust hybrid technique based on watermarking and selective encryption for maintaining confidentiality and achieving copyright protection of the transmitted HEVC information. The watermarking method employs the Homomorphic transform and singular value decomposition in the discrete wavelet transform to increase the immunity of watermarked HEVC streams to attacks. Moreover, the selective encryption technique uses the Chaotic logistic map for encrypting the motion vector difference and the discrete cosine transform sign bits to provide the feature of HEVC format compliance with low encryption overhead cost. An extensive security investigation is carried out for the proposed selective HEVC cybersecurity framework. The obtained experimental outcomes ensure and validate the effectiveness of the selective HEVC cybersecurity framework for HEVC sequences transmission. Chaotic logistic map. DWT. HEVC security.

Organizational science and cybersecurity: abundant opportunities for research at the interface. Cybersecurity is an ever-present problem for organizations, but organizational science has barely begun to enter the arena of cybersecurity research. As a result, the human factor in cybersecurity research is much less studied than its technological counterpart. The current manuscript serves as an introduction and invitation to cybersecurity research by organizational scientists. We define cybersecurity, provide definitions of key cybersecurity constructs relevant to employee behavior, illuminate the unique opportunities available to organizational scientists in the cybersecurity arena (e.g., publication venues that reach new audiences, novel sources of external funding), and provide overall conceptual frameworks of the antecedents of employees’ cybersecurity behavior. In so doing, we emphasize both end-users of cybersecurity in organizations and employees focused specifically on cybersecurity work. We provide an expansive agenda for future organizational science research on cybersecurity—and we describe the benefits such research can provide not only to cybersecurity but also to basic research in organizational science itself. We end by providing a list of potential objections to the proposed research along with our responses to these objections. It is our hope that the current manuscript will catalyze research at the interface of organizational science and cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. Incident response. Information security. Insider threat.

Cybersecurity in the Local Government Sector in Poland: More Work Needs to be Done. Although cybersecurity is an important and complex issue that should be addressed by all government levels, so far little research has been devoted to cybersecurity at the local level. Existing literature lacks information on whether municipalities have implemented cybersecurity policies, if such policies are applied in practice and what they encompass. A CAWI method was used to collect the required data. The results indicate that while most municipalities have a document defining their security policy, they do not always apply it in practice. There is still little awareness regarding countering cyber-attacks. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on such issues as: integrating cybersecurity policies into local government management, the rising threat of cyber-attacks, consultations with security auditors, and cybersecurity management training. Based on all Polish municipalities, the research described in this paper partly fills the identified gap. cybersecurity. information security. local government. Poland. public sector. 
CYBER-SECURITY KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF NURSES IN PRIVATE HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN DURBAN, KWAZULU-NATAL. South African nurses work extensively with predominately paper-based medical information (patient/health records). Private secondary healthcare facilities are leading the transition towards digitised and interconnected Medical Information Systems (MIS). Electronic Health (eHealth) information is extremely lucrative on the black-market. therefore, large MIS databases (found in leading private hospitals) are prime targets for cybercrime. Employee negligence and human error account for almost half of database breach causes globally. Therefore, the security of MIS is significantly dependent on the MIS custodians (nursing, support, pharmaceutical, administration and management) utilising them. As South Africa transitions towards her eHealth strategic objectives, this study evaluated an essential element of information security – the cyber security awareness and practice of her MIS custodians. 185 MIS custodians working in two leading private hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), were investigated and their reactions around cyber practice, cyber threats targeting end-users within the healthcare industry (viz. malware, social engineering, spam, phishing and Ransomware), and cyber awareness was evaluated. The results indicate a significant misunderstanding or ignorance of cyber and information terminology. lack of cyber security awareness and secure cyber practice. poor understanding of cyber threats and prescribed mitigations. and uncertainty pertaining to relevant legislation around electronic patient information. The current cyber security practice and knowledge of MIS custodians is concerning warranting intervention. Cyber-crime. Cyber-security. EHealth. Medical Information Systems. Tele-health.

A Corporate Governance Approach to Cybersecurity Risk Disclosure. This article sheds light on cybersecurity risk disclosure practices, offering explanations based on the corporate governance literature. We argue that cybersecurity risk management poses particular challenges for corporations due to amplified agency problems. Cybersecurity risks are increasing in number and growing in complexity for companies worldwide. The financial sector in the Benelux region was already digitalising rapidly when, in 2020, enhanced remote-working requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic further contributed to risk exposure. Substantiating our theoretical discussion, we present and discuss insights as to the most pressing cybersecurity risk management issues in the financial sector based on evidence from semi-structured interviews with Chief Information Security Officers/Chief Security Officers from financial sector leads in the Benelux region. We discuss contemporary factors that might induce management to dedicate more attention to cybersecurity. This apparent shift in companies' approaches regarding cybersecurity is likely to encounter obstacles and should not be expected to be an even and linear process, given the challenges of processing and communicating information in an environment featuring high uncertainty and technical complexity as well as potentially misaligned incentives.

EXTRACTING EXPLOITS AND ATTACK VECTORS FROM CYBERSECURITY NEWS USING NLP. Cybersecurity has an immense impact on society as it enables the digital protection of individuals and enterprises against an increasing number of online threats. Moreover, the rate at which attackers discover and exploit critical vulnerabilities outperforms the vendors’ capabilities to respond accordingly and provide security patches. As such, open-source intelligence data (OSINT) has become a valuable resource, from which details on zero-day vulnerabilities can be retrieved and timely actions can be taken before the patches become available. In this paper we propose a method to automatically label articles on vulnerabilities and cyberattacks from trusted sources. Using Named Entity Recognition, we extract essential information about new vulnerabilities, such as the exploit’s public release and the environment in which the attack’s exploitation is possible. Our balanced dataset contains 1095 samples out of which 250 entries are from cybersecurity articles. the rest of the articles were crawled and annotated from the U.S. Government’s Vulnerability Database, whereas automated text augmentation techniques were also considered. Our model built on top of spaCy obtained an overall performance of 75% recall on the Exploit Available task. When considering the Attack Vector metric, the model achieved the following recalls: Network 72%, Local 78%, and Physical 92%. Attack Vector. Entity Labeling. Exploit. spaCy. Zero-days Attack. 
Cybersecurity Attack-resilience Authentication Mechanism for Intelligent Healthcare System. People focus on the intelligent healthcare system expecting sufficient medical facilities even from a remote location. However, to make the healthcare system more trustworthy, secure access control plays a vital role in resisting several cyber-attacks Security threat on medical data is highly sensitive since it is associated with life risks. Traditional authentication provides a solution to allow such kind of application only to the authorized users. But once a user is authenticated, and he/she is idle for a while, the chances of security threat are reasonably high. In this paper, we have addressed an intelligent user-recognization mechanism for continuous monitoring of the users activity throughout the session. We have made the system more user-friendly through single sign-on and eliminated trusted third-party dependency to avoid data breaches. Once the authentication is performed, then in a later stage, the continuous monitoring mechanism, which is based on machine-learning techniques, helps to decide the user&#x0027. s unique behavior allowing the server to make better decisions regarding the users authenticity in an ongoing session. The security analysis shows that the overall system is more secure than the traditional authentication mechanism. IEEE. Attack. Authentication. Behavioral sciences. Continuous Authentication.

Cyber Security in Power Electronics Using Minimal Data &#x2013. A Physics-Informed Spline Learning Approach. Cyber attacks can be strategically counterfeited to replicate grid faults, thereby manipulating the protection system and leading to accidental disconnection of grid-tied converters. To prevent such setbacks, we propose a physics-informed spline learning (PiSL) approach based anomaly diagnosis mechanism to distinguish between both events using minimal data for the first time in the realm of power electronics. This methodology not only provides compelling accuracy with limited data, but also reduces the training and computational resources significantly. We validate its effectiveness and accuracy under experimental conditions to conclude how data availability problem can be handled. IEEE. anomaly diagnosis. artificial intelligence.

Effective Cyber Security Using IoT to Prevent E-Threats and Hacking During Covid-19. This research work is conducted to make the analysis of digital technology is one of the most admired and effective technologies that has been applied in the global context for faster data management. Starting from business management to connectivity, everywhere the application of IoT and digital technology is undeniable. Besides the advancement of the data management, cyber security is also important to prevent the data stealing or accessing from the unauthorized data. In this context the IoT security technology focusing on the safeguarding the IoT devices connected with internet. Different technologies are taken under the consideration for developing the IoT based cyber security such as Device authentication, Secure on boarding, data encryption and creation of the bootstrap server. All of these technologies are effective to its ground for protecting the digital data. In order to prevent cyber threats and hacking activities like SQL injection, Phishing, and DoS, this research paper has proposed a newer technique of the encryption process by using the python codes and also shown the difference between typical conventional system and proposed system for understanding both the system in a better way.

When is a law firm liable for a data breach? An exploration into the legal liability of ransomware and cybersecurity. Purpose: The threat of cybercrime is pervasive. Corporations cannot be convinced, out of sheer luck or naïve conviction, that they will remain unaffected. When targeted, the stark reality is that a company also incurs a liability risk. This paper aims to explore the boundaries of liability resulting from a data breach and privacy concerns according to the emerging regulations on cybersecurity. Design/methodology/approach: The nature of cybercrime and its constant evolution is analysed as a threat of liability. Its distinctly modern developments require consideration. In response to the threat of hackers, the protection that a corporation can invoke is also considered as a mitigating factor in ascribing liability. Findings: Preventative steps to protect a corporation from cyberthreats must remain a consistent priority in the running of a company. The influence of human behaviour has become a foreseeable element in cybersecurity and as such the management of unreliable user behaviour is a key determining factor in ascribing liability in hindsight. Originality/value: Foresight is everything in the prevention of cyberattacks. Cyberattacks can no longer be dismissed as an unlikely eventuality. Legislation on data security and data privacy is demanding higher standards of preventative action, under the duty of care to stakeholders. There is a substantial literature deficit on data security and data liability regulations in light of the liability risk incurred by cyberattacks. Cyberattacks. Cybersecurity. Data privacy.

The Reality of Cybersecurity and its Challenges in Saudi Arabia [واقع الأمن السيبراني وتحدياته في السعودية]. Recent technological developments have led to an increasingly wide use of electronic devices, platforms and applications. These technologies are now an important factor in the digital transformations taking place in many governmental agencies. In parallel with these technological advancements, new cybercrime techniques have been developed, making them a complex and highly prioritized national security issue for many countries around the world. To address this challenge, the Saudi Arabian government, through a royal decree, has urged government agencies to create internal cybersecurity departments to safeguard their information and technical assets. This makes cybersecurity a critical element of the Kingdom’s 2030 Vision. This study aims to shed light on the reality of cybersecurity and its challenges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The researcher designed a questionnaire to measure several dimensions, including cybersecurity management, addressing cyber threats and risks, security techniques, and future (strategic) challenges. A sample of 98 IT employees working in different government agencies participated in this study. The results of the data analysis show that the level of cybersecurity against cyber threats and risks is high in the government agencies of Saudi Arabia. Cyber risks management.

Action Bias and the Two Most Dangerous Words in Cybersecurity Incident Response: An Argument for More Measured Incident Response. An inherent aspect of cybersecurity is managing incidents where people expect to see an immediate response. Action bias is our tendency to favor action over inaction because it makes us feel better-even if we have made things worse. 
Detecting Cybersecurity Threats: The Role of the Recency and Risk Compensating Effects. Detecting and responding to information security threats quickly and effectively is becoming increasingly crucial as modern attackers continue to engineer their attacks to operate covertly to maintain long-term access to victims’ systems after the initial penetration. We conducted an experiment to investigate various aspects of decision makers’ behavior in monitoring for threats in systems that potentially have been compromised by intrusions. In checking for threats, decision makers showed a recency effect: they deviated from optimal monitoring behavior by altering their checking pattern in response to recent random incidents. Decision makers’ monitoring behavior was also adversely affected when there was an increase in security, exhibiting a risk compensating behavior through which heightened security leads to debilitated security behaviors. Although the magnitude of the risk compensating behavior was significant, it was not enough to fully offset the benefits from added security. We discuss implications for theory and practice of information security. Incident detection and response. Information security. Post-compromise stage. Recency effect. Risk compensating behavior. 
Cybersecurity in business education: The ‘how to’ in incorporating education into practice. Cybersecurity threats have been intensifying and becoming more diverse. Social engineering can enable or enhance these technical attacks. This interplay between technical attacks and social engineering, when used, makes every employee, manager and board member a part of the security infrastructure of an organization. As such, it is incumbent upon systems of higher education to educate both information technologists and organizational leaders on the broader issues: a multidisciplinary approach is needed. This article contributes to the literature by providing a comparison of industry-identified needs to protect against cybersecurity threats and what should be offered by business school academic programs. business curriculum. cybersecurity.

Cyber-security and risky behaviors in a developing country context: a Pakistani perspective. Cyber-security behavior research is scant with even scarce studies carried out in developing countries. We examine the cyber-security and risky Internet behaviors of undergraduate students from Pakistan, taking into account the diversity of these students in terms of demographics, socioeconomic status, and the digital divide. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire. A total of 294 students belonging to six different cities of Pakistan were surveyed employing multistage stratified sampling in face-to-face interaction. The results indicated significant differences of cyber-security posture in terms of gender, age and digital divide variables. The profiles of students based on cyber-security and risky Internet behaviors indicate three groups with a majority of them falling into group that exhibits more risk-averse yet low cyber-security behavior. Moreover, proactive cyber-security awareness behavior has a positive impact on high risk-averse behavior. The implications of the findings are studied in terms of providing customized training and awareness. The future directions are laid out for further explorations in terms of cultural differences within and cross-country contexts. Cyber-security behavior. Developing country. Risky behavior. Survey.

A deep recursively learning LSTM model to improve cyber security Botnet attack intrusion detection. The occurrence of botnets over the network is crucial as it shows advent effect on various applications like finance, cyber-security, and healthcare application. Botnets are refined and more dangerous in their functionality over the network model. Most of the prevailing models and flow- and rule-based models feel challenging to predict the bot functionalities in a preventive manner. Therefore, the modeling of efficient and automated botnet detection approaches is highly essential. This research concentrates on modeling a novel botnet detection approach based on the recursively analyzing the flow of features of the network nodes spatially and temporally where the attack samples are intra-dependent time-series data. The hierarchical structural design of the network helps to integrate various levels of feature information and learns the spatial and temporal information automatically among the adjacent network connection. This process is carried out by the proposed architectural model known as Recursively Learning Long Short-Term Memory over spatial and temporal (RL2TM-st). Thus, the bot activities are detected by recursively analyzing the limited number of nodes. The RL2TM-st model is modeled to improve the efficiency of the network by eliminating unnecessary activities. The proposed model is validated using the online accessible CTU-13 dataset and benchmarked against the prevailing classification approaches for botnet detection. The simulation is done in a MATLAB environment, and the outcomes work efficiently and evaluated with prevailing models to project the significance of the RL2TM-st model. automated system.

Applications of educational data mining and learning analytics on data from cybersecurity training. Cybersecurity professionals need hands-on training to prepare for managing the current advanced cyber threats. To practice cybersecurity skills, training participants use numerous software tools in computer-supported interactive learning environments to perform offensive or defensive actions. The interaction involves typing commands, communicating over the network, and engaging with the training environment. The training artifacts (data resulting from this interaction) can be highly beneficial in educational research. For example, in cybersecurity education, they provide insights into the trainees’ learning processes and support effective learning interventions. However, this research area is not yet well-understood. Therefore, this paper surveys publications that enhance cybersecurity education by leveraging trainee-generated data from interactive learning environments. We identified and examined 3021 papers, ultimately selecting 35 articles for a detailed review. First, we investigated which data are employed in which areas of cybersecurity training, how, and why. Second, we examined the applications and impact of research in this area, and third, we explored the community of researchers. Our contribution is a systematic literature review of relevant papers and their categorization according to the collected data, analysis methods, and application contexts. These results provide researchers, developers, and educators with an original perspective on this emerging topic. To motivate further research, we identify trends and gaps, propose ideas for future work, and present practical recommendations. Overall, this paper provides in-depth insight into the recently growing research on collecting and analyzing data from hands-on training in security contexts. Cybersecurity education. Data science.

Cybersecurity does the protection from theft and damage of all categories of data that require to be retained top secret. Cybersecurity-related problems that are predicted on lingual data have become the center of attention for researchers in modern times. It is possible to design these uncertain problems by matrix game, where the respective attacker and defender are possibly interpreted as players. Interval-valued neutrosophic numbers (IVNNs) are used as an excellent tool to counter such uncertain circumstances in respect of fuzzy sets/intuitionistic fuzzy sets or ordinary intervals. IVNN addresses topics with a set of interval numbers in the real unit interval. In this paper, cybersecurity-related issues are explored using matrix game, where the respective payoffs are considered as IVNNs. A nonlinear programming approach is presented by constructing two interval-valued multi-objective problems for the players. Then, the subsequent problems are transferred into a pair of auxiliary nonlinear programming models. The weighted average approach is used to solve the reduced problems. A numerical example of the cybersecurity problem in the banking sector is illustrated to show the applicability of the proposed approach. A comparison analysis is performed with existing work to authenticate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Cybersecurity. Interval-valued neutrosophic number. Matrix game.

The Influences of Public and Institutional Pressure on Firms’ Cybersecurity Disclosures. Cybersecurity disclosures in reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inform investors about firms’ cybersecurity incidents, risks, and related risk management efforts. Firms have traditionally chosen to communicate such information on a quarterly or annual basis, if at all, and prior research on the topic has largely focused on regulatory factors as driving forces. In this paper, we focus on timely disclosures (via 8-K filings) and derive hypotheses regarding the influences of two alternate forms of pressure as drivers of cybersecurity disclosures—(1) public pressure following a firm’s data breach and (2) pressure arising from the breaches of industry peers, which we cast as institutional pressure. We also theorize on how the source of the breach (internal or external) influences these forms of pressure. Our results suggest that firms’ cybersecurity disclosure practices are influenced by public pressure following a data breach and that this pressure is more acute for external breaches than for internal breaches. By contrast, breaches by industry peers, as a form of institutional pressure, appear to prompt fewer cybersecurity disclosures, except when the focal firm suffers its own external breach. From a theoretical perspective, our study supports a nuanced application of legitimacy theory in the cybersecurity disclosure context, especially in the midst of public and institutional pressure, such that the source of a data breach determines whether firms attempt to address the resultant legitimacy gap. From a practical perspective, our results may be viewed as alarming in that firms are not reacting to internal breaches with the same degree of communicative effort about cybersecurity as for external breaches, at least in terms of the timely disclosures we consider in this study. Our findings also point to certain levers that can promote timely cybersecurity disclosures, and thus have important policy implications. Cybersecurity. Data Breach. Disclosure. Information Security.

Distribution of Terms across Genres in the Annotated Lithuanian Cybersecurity Corpus. The paper provides results of the frequential distribution analysis of cybersecurity terms used in the Lithuanian cybersecurity corpus composed of texts of different genres. The research focuses on the following aspects: overall distribution of cybersecurity terms (their density and diversity) across genres, distribution of English and English-Lithuanian terms and their usage patterns in Lithuanian sentences, and, finally, the most frequent cybersecurity terms and their thematic groups in each genre. The research was performed in several stages: compilation of a cybersecurity corpus and its subdivision into genre-specific subcorpora, manual annotation of cybersecurity terms, automatic lemmatisation of annotated terms and, finally, quantitative analysis of the distribution of the terms across the subcorpora. The results reveal the similarities and differences of the use of cybersecurity terminology across genres which are important to consider to get a complete picture of terminology usage trends in this domain.

The IoT and the new EU cybersecurity regulatory landscape. This article aims to cast light on how the fast-evolving European cybersecurity regulatory framework would impact the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The legal analysis investigates whether and to what extent existing and proposed sectoral EU legislation addresses the manifold challenges in securing IoT and its supply chain. It firstly takes into account the Cybersecurity Act, being the most recent and relevant EU legal act covering ICT products and cybersecurity services. Then, EU product legislation is scrutinised. The analysis focuses on the delegated act recently adopted by the Commission under the Radio Equipment Directive (RED), strengthening wireless devices’ cybersecurity, the Medical Devices Regulation, the Proposal for a General Product Safety Regulation and the Proposal for a Machinery Regulation. Lastly, the proposal for a revised Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) is assessed in terms of its potential impact on the field of IoT cybersecurity. Against this backdrop, the article concludes by advocating the need for a separate horizontal legislation on cybersecurity for connected products. To avoid fragmentation of the EU's Single Market, a horizontal legal act should be based on the principles of the New Legislative Framework, with ex-ante and ex-post cybersecurity requirements for all IoT sectors and products categories. cybersecurity.

USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS IN CYBERSECURITY. Cybersecurity is an ever-changing field, with advances in technology that open up new opportunities for cyberattacks. In addition, even though serious security breaches are often reported, small organizations still have to worry about security breaches as they can often be the target of viruses and phishing. This is why it is so important to ensure the privacy of your user profile in cyberspace. The past few years have seen a rise in machine learning algorithms that address major cybersecurity issues such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), detection of new modifications of known malware, malware, and spam detection, and malware analysis. In this article, algorithms have been analyzed using data mining collected from various libraries, and analytics with additional emerging data-driven models to provide more effective security solutions. In addition, an analysis was carried out of companies that are engaged in cyber attacks using machine learning. According to the research results, it was revealed that the concept of cybersecurity data science allows you to make the computing process more efficient and intelligent compared to traditional processes in the field of cybersecurity. As a result, according to the results of the study, it was revealed that machine learning, namely unsupervised learning, is an effective method of dealing with risks in cybersecurity and cyberattacks.

A Deep Transfer Learning Approach to Enhance Network Intrusion Detection Capabilities for Cyber Security. Cyberattacks are on the rise, making technology companies increasingly prone to data theft. Recent research has focused on constructing cognitive models for traffic anomaly detection in a communication network. Many of these experiments resulted in data packets recorded by technologies like Wireshark. These datasets provide high-dimensional data relating to benign and malicious data packets. Recent research has mostly focused on developing machine learning, and deep learning systems o detect attack data packets in a network. Also, machine learning algorithms are currently trained to detect only known threats. However, with the growth of new cyberattacks and zero-day attacks, current algorithms are unable to detect unknown attacks. This research focuses on detecting rare attacks using transfer learning from a dataset of known attacks. Deep learning outperforms explicit statistical modelling approaches by at least 21% for the dataset used. A preliminary survey of candidate deep learning architectures has been performed before testing for transferability and proposes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture that is 99.65% accurate in classifying attack data packets. The suggested CNN architecture trained with a known attack and then tested its performance on unknown attacks to assess transferability. For this model to extract sufficient information for transferability, the training samples must have more information. Only 20% of the dataset represents current threat data. Several strategies, such as innovative synthetic dataset-based training and bootstrapped dataset training, have been developed to overcome small training sets. A subset of training attacks is determined to optimise learning potential. This study finds training-testing attack pairings with good learning transferability. The most robust and stable relationships are found in DoS attack training-testing pairings. This study also presents model generalisation hypotheses. The dataset features and attack characteristics were analysed using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm to validate the results. convolutional neural network. cyber security. intrusion detection system. machine learning and deep learning.

Risk vs. threat-based cybersecurity: the case of the EU. In a relatively short time, cybersecurity has risen to become one of the EU’s security priorities. While the institutionalisation of EU-level cybersecurity capacities has been substantial since the first EU cybersecurity strategy was published, previous research has also identified resistance from member states to allow the EU to have more control over their cybersecurity activities. Despite a growing literature on EU cybersecurity governance, there are currently extensive gaps in the understanding of this tension. This study suggests that an explanatory factor can be found in the so-far overlooked dynamic of the relative prevalence of risk vs. threat-based security logics in the EU cybersecurity approach. By distinguishing between risk and threat-based logics in the development of the EU cybersecurity discourse over time, this study highlights a shift towards an increasing threat-based security logic in the EU cybersecurity approach. The identified development highlights securitising moves enacting to a larger extent than before objects and subjects of security traditionally associated with national security. The study identifies specific areas of member state contestation accompanying this shift and concludes with a discussion on the findings in relation to the development of the EU as a security actor in the wider international cybersecurity landscape.

Mapping the Cybersecurity Research: A Scientometric Analysis of Indian Publications. In addition to physical treats, cyber-threats and crimes are on the rise, which necessitates a greater focus on cybersecurity research. The goal of this study is to identify and characterize the cybersecurity research done by Indian (co)authors, based on the Scopus database with a focus on the yearly trend, top authors and institutions, collaborating countries, preferred sources, and most cited publications. Various software tools were used to analyze the data such as MS-Excel, Bibliometrix R Package, VOSviewer and UCINET. Conceptual and social structures are also explored. India is ranked fourth and has seen a significant growth in the number of publications. In the last three years, about 70% of papers was published, with conference paper being the most popular mode of communication. Indian researchers have switched their focus away from data-related issues and toward machine learning, cloud computing and AI-related technologies. This study can be used as a proxy because there is no substantial difference between Indian and global research. Bibliometrics. cyber security. cyber-security. India. scientometrics. Scopus. 
Cybersecurity Awareness in Online Education: A Case Study Analysis. This study presents to what extent Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University students are knowledgeable about cybersecurity in the distance education process. The survey was conducted with a sample of 517 students from all faculties of the university at the undergraduate, graduate, and PhD levels. Our research study shows that although huge numbers of cyberattacks are occurring around the world, the students did not have any knowledge about cybersecurity and the effects of cyberattacks overall. An analysis of cybersecurity awareness was undertaken by asking questions focused on malicious software, password security, and social media security. Although we live in an age of technology where our entire lives are indexed to the internet through the distance education process, it has been determined that students have a weak cybersecurity awareness. It has been further concluded that cybersecurity education should be given to prevent the students from becoming a victim of cyberattacks, helping them to use the internet more effectively.

Effects of Security Knowledge, Self-Control, and Countermeasures on Cybersecurity Behaviors. Organizations whose employees participate in risky cybersecurity behaviors (RCySecB) could suffer disastrous consequences either directly or indirectly from actions linked to such behaviors. This study used conceptualizations facilitated by Attribution Theory to examine the effects of dispositional factors (self-control and knowledge of IS security threats/risks and their potential consequences) and situational factors (security, education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs and computer monitoring) in reducing employee participation in RCySecB. Data was collected from a survey of working professionals in India, and relevant hypotheses were formulated. The PLS technique was used for data analysis. This study investigated the direct effects of the factors on the dependent construct and analyzed the interacting effects of the constructs as well. The results indicate that all factors reduce employee participation in RCySecB. However, the joint effects of the situational factor elements and the dispositional factor of personal knowledge security threats/risks and their potential consequences were insignificant in the model.

A review on cybersecurity in railways. Digitalisation is transforming the railway globally. One of the major considerations in digital transformation of any industry including the railway is the increased exposure to cyberattacks. The railway industry is vulnerable to these attacks because since the number of digital items and also number of interfaces between digital and physical components in the railway systems keep increasing. Increased number of items and interfaces require new frameworks, concepts and architectures to ensure the railway system’s resilience with respect to cybersecurity challenges, such as lack of proactiveness, lack of holistic perspective and obsolescence of safety systems exposed to current and future cyber threats landscape. To this date, there are several works carried out in the literature that studied the cybersecurity aspects and its application on railway infrastructure. However, to develop and implement an appropriate roadmap to cybersecurity in railways, there is a need of describing emerging challenges, and approaches to deal with these challenges and the possibilities and benefits of these. Hence, the objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review and outline cybersecurity emerging trends and approaches, and also to identify possible solutions by querying literature, academic and industrial, for future directions. The authors of this paper conducted separate searches through four popular databases, that is, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and IEEE explore. For the screening process, authors have used keywords with Boolean operators and database filters and identified 90 articles most relevant to the study domain. The analysis of 90 articles shows that majority of the cybersecurity studies lies within the railways are conceptual and lags in application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based security. Like other industries, it is very important that railways should also follow latest security technologies, trends and train their workforce for cyber hygiene since railways are already in digitalization transition mode. challenges. cybersecurity. railway. review. safety. 
Classifier Calibration: with application to threat scores in cybersecurity. This paper explores the calibration of a classifier output score in binary classification problems. A calibrator is a function that maps the arbitrary classifier score, of a testing observation, onto <formula><tex>$[0,1]$</tex></formula> to provide an estimate for the posterior probability of belonging to one of the two classes. Calibration is important for two reasons. first, it provides a meaningful score, that is the posterior probability. second, it puts the scores of different classifiers on the same scale for comparable interpretation. The paper presents three main contributions: (1) Introducing multi-score calibration, when more than one classifier provides a score for a single observation. (2) Introducing the idea that the classifier scores to a calibration process are nothing but features to a classifier, hence proposing extending the classifier scores to higher dimensions to boost the calibrator's performance. (3) Conducting a massive simulation study, 24,000 experiments, that incorporates different configurations, in addition to experimenting on two real datasets from the cybersecurity domain. The results show that there is no overall winner among the different calibrators and different configurations. However, Platt's has a very stable and acceptable performance, and our suggested multi-score calibration provides better performance than single score calibration. IEEE. Calibration. Classification.

A constrained optimization model for the provision of services in a 5G network with multi-level cybersecurity investments. In this paper, we present a multi-tiered network-based optimization model describing the provision of services by network slices of 5G-Service providers (e.g. through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) organized as Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANET)), taking into account the security levels of each provider. The three levels of the network consist of the infrastructure layers, which contain resources needed to execute a service, the slices layer, where services are served for the services layer, which represents the upper layer of the network and consists of services or applications required by users or devices. The objective of the proposed model is to establish the optimal flows between network layers and the optimal security levels in order to maximize the providers’ profits, given by the difference between the revenues obtained by the sale of services and the rental of their resources and the costs. Numerical experiments are performed and solved with a new nature-inspired genetic algorithm adapted to the optimization 5G network problem. 5G Network slicing. Constrained optimization.

It Won’t Happen to Me: Surveying SME Attitudes to Cyber-security. We report an online survey of 85 U.K-based SMEs that explored their threat and coping appraisals toward five common types of cyber-attack: Network being hacked. Data being stolen or encrypted. malware infection. mobile devices being compromised. and phishing e-mail attack. Overall, SMEs’ reported assessment of the risk of an attack was low, particularly for the possibility of their business network being hacked or their data being stolen or encrypted. However, there was an incongruence in their Threat Appraisals since, while they believed the risks to be low, they reported that the impact would be high. In terms of Coping Appraisal, respondents indicated that measures to prevent such attacks were both inexpensive and effective. However, their reported self-efficacy was significantly lower for keeping mobile devices safe and avoiding phishing attacks. We discuss these results taking into consideration additional qualitative data and provide recommendations for SME engagement. coping appraisal. SME cyber security. threat appraisal. 
Prevent and Reduce the Risk of Implementing the Main Cybersecurity Threats. In hybrid conflicts of any intensity, hostilities (operations) are an element of other (non-force) actions mutually coordinated according to a single plan, mainly economic, political, diplomatic, informational, psychological, cyber, cognitive, etc. This creates destabilizing internal and external processes in the state that is the object of aggression (concern and discontent of the population, migration, acts of civil disobedience, etc.). The article examines the effective organizational and technical countermeasures against hybrid threats, national cyber defense systems in the developed countries. The article also presents the results of the investigations into the effects of the information hybrid threats through cyberspace on social, technical, socio and technical systems. The composition of the system of early efficient detection of the above hybrids is proposed. The results of the structural and parametric synthesis of the system are described. The recommendations related to the system implementation are given.

Connected and vulnerable: cybersecurity in vehicles. Back in 2015, two hackers hacked a Jeep Cherokee, wirelessly gaining access to the controls of the vehicle through the vehicle’s entertainment system. The hackers slowed the vehicle down on a highway. Remarkably, this did not result in accidents. This did, however, illustrate the already existing cybersecurity risks of vehicles and their threat to road safety, thereby making legislators aware of these dangers. Recently, several legislative steps were made to improve the cybersecurity in vehicles. As cybersecurity enters the realm of road safety, it is necessary to identify the key principles for cybersecurity in vehicles. The current legal framework is discussed in light of these principles, identifying gaps in the current legal framework for cybersecurity in vehicles. As this contribution argues, the focus of the current legislative measures focuses predominantly on the ‘first line of defence’. These measures aim to prevent unauthorised access to the vehicle’s systems, but fail to identify the steps necessary to limit the damage that can be done if this first line of defence is breached and unauthorised access is gained. Moreover, other identified cybersecurity principles are not adequately ensured. In addition, the fragmentation of the current legal framework in itself gives rise to concerns. Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity Risk Assessment of Industrial Control Systems Based on Order-α Divergence Measures Under an Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Environment. With the increasing deployment of network technologies in industrial control systems (ICSs), cybersecurity has become a challenge in ICSs. Cybersecurity risk assessment (CRA) plays an important role in cybersecurity protection of ICSs. However, the weights of risk indices are constants in traditional CRA methods, and they do not fully consider the requirements of risk identification. In this paper, we define a novel order-α divergence measure for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) and further develop a novel CRA approach for ICSs based on the proposed divergence measure under an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment to contribute to the research gap. First, an order-α divergence measure for IVIFNs is defined considering flexibility and robustness of divergence measures with the parameter. Next, a variable weight-based CRA approach for ICSs is developed. In this approach, IVIFNs are adopted to describe evaluation values of risk indices. The weights of risk indices are variable weight vectors and they are determined by the relative divergence closeness. Integration approaches of each node and each attack path in attack-defense trees (ADTs) are proposed based on the operations of IVIFNs, and risk scores of each attack path are calculated by using the score function. Finally, we apply the proposed method to the CRA of a civil aviation fuel supply automatic control system and verify its effectiveness and advantages by comparing it with other methods. This method can dynamically adjust the weights of risk indices considering the relationship between each risk index and the highest risk, and therefore, it can more effectively recognize the highest risk of ICSs than the traditional CRA method. In addition, it can also match the risk attitude of decision-makers by adjusting the parameter α. Cybersecurity risk assessment (CRA). Industrial control systems (ICSs).

The &#x2019. Cybersecurity via Determinism&#x2019. Paradigm for a Quantum Safe Zero Trust Deterministic Internet of Things (IoT). The next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) will control the critical infrastructure of the 21st century, including the Smart Power Grid and Smart Cities. It will also support Deterministic Communications, where &#x2019. deterministic traffic flows&#x2019. (D-flows) receive strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. A &#x2019. Cybersecurity via Determinism&#x2019. paradigm for the next-generation Deterministic IoT is presented. A forwarding sub-layer of simplified &#x2019. deterministic packet switches&#x2019. (D-switches) is introduced into layer-3. This sub-layer supports many deterministic Software DefinedWide Area Networks (SD-WANs), along with 3 new tools: Access Control, Rate Control, and Isolation Control. A Software Defined Networking (SDN) control-plane configures each D-switch with multiple deterministic schedules to support D-flows. The SDN control-plane can embed millions of isolated Deterministic Virtual Private Networks (DVPNs) into layer 3. This paradigm offers several benefits: (i) All congestion, interference, and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attacks are removed. (ii) Buffer sizes in D-switches are reduced by 1,000+ times. (iii) End-to-end IoT delays can be reduced to ultra-low latencies, ie the speed-of-light in fiber. (iv) The D-switches do not require Gigabytes of memory to store large IP routing tables. (v) Hardware support is provided in layer 3 for the US NIST Zero Trust Architecture. (vi) Packets within a DVPN can be entirely encrypted using Quantum Safe encryption, which is impervious to attacks by Quantum Computers using existing quantum algorithms. (vii) The probability of an undetected cyberattack targeting a DVPN can be made arbitrarily small by using long Quantum Safe encryption keys.

Exploring Incentives and Challenges for Cybersecurity Intelligence Sharing (CIS) across Organizations: A Systematic Review. Cybersecurity intelligence sharing (CIS) has gained significance as an organizational function to protect critical information assets, manage cybersecurity risks, and improve cybersecurity operations. However, few studies have synthesized accumulated scholarly knowledge on CIS practices across disciplines. Synthesizing the pertinent literature through a structured literature review, we investigated the incentives and challenges that influence organizations around adopting CIS practices. We used the overarching TOE framework to categorize these factors and propose a theoretical framework to establish common ground for future studies. We also developed a holistic and inclusive definition for cybersecurity intelligence that we present in the paper. We found 46 papers on CIS in different disciplines and analyzed them to answer our research questions. We identified 35 factors that we classified according to the TOE framework. With this paper, we facilitate further theory development by overviewing theories that researchers can use as a basis for CIS studies, suggesting future directions, providing a reference source, and developing a reference CIS framework for IS scholars.

The impact of financial deprivation on children’s cybersecurity knowledge & abilities. Online users require a working knowledge of password best practice, as well as the ability to apply such knowledge. Children increasingly operate as independent agents online, and thus also need to be aware of password best practice. To meet this need, the Scottish curriculum for excellence includes lessons about password best practice. Hence, all Scottish children ought, theoretically, to have similar levels of password-related knowledge. They ought also, by age 8-9, to be able to apply their knowledge. One factor that could deter password-related knowledge acquisition and skill development is financial deprivation. To gauge its impact, we assessed the knowledge and abilities of Scottish 8-9 year old children, in four primary schools, in areas of varying financial deprivation. We uncovered stark differences in knowledge and password retention. There is a clear need for an extra-curricular intervention programme to teach up-to-date password best practice and support in developing the required password management skills. This will reduce their online vulnerabilities, whatever their socio-economic background. Cybersecurity. Deprivation. Passwords. 
Cybersecurity Threat Assessment Integrating Qualitative Differential and Evolutionary Games. Most current game theory-based cybersecurity analysis methods use traditional game models, which do not meet realistic conditions of continuous dynamic changes in attack-defense behaviors and decision makers without perfect rationality, and therefore they adapt with difficulty to the practical requirements of cybersecurity threat assessment. This paper draws on infectious disease dynamics methods to describe the cybersecurity threat propagation process. It constructs a dynamic game model of a cybersecurity threat based on continuous attack-defense confrontation and boundedly rational decision makers, combining qualitative differential and evolutionary game theories. Qualitative differential games are used to analyze the confrontation process of security threats, calculate attack-defense barriers, and construct a benchmark to measure the degree of a security threat. Evolutionary games are used to analyze the dynamic change of attack-defense strategy-selection probabilities based on replicator dynamics, and to deduce the evolutionary trajectory of the network security state. We then calculate the multidimensional Euclidean distance between the evolutionary trajectory and the attack-defense barrier metric benchmark, and use it as the basis for a dynamic threat assessment algorithm to improve the timeliness and objectivity of threat assessment. Simulation experiments show that the model and algorithm are effective and feasible. IEEE. Analytical models. attack-defense barrier. Biological system modeling. Computer security. cybersecurity.

Edge-IIoTset: A New Comprehensive Realistic Cyber Security Dataset of IoT and IIoT Applications for Centralized and Federated Learning. In this paper, we propose a new comprehensive realistic cyber security dataset of IoT and IIoT applications, called Edge-IIoTset, which can be used by machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in two different modes, namely, centralized and federated learning. Specifically, the dataset has been generated using a purpose-built IoT/IIoT testbed with a large representative set of devices, sensors, protocols and cloud/edge configurations. The IoT data are generated from various IoT devices (more than 10 types) such as Low-cost digital sensors for sensing temperature and humidity, Ultrasonic sensor, Water level detection sensor, pH Sensor Meter, Soil Moisture sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Flame Sensor, etc.). Furthermore, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to IoT and IIoT connectivity protocols, which are categorized into five threats, including, DoS/DDoS attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network traffic, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes. The Edge-IIoTset dataset can be publicly accessed from http://ieee-dataport.org/8939. Cybersecurity applications. deep learning. edge {computing}. federated learning. IoT datasets. 
A Reputation Game on Cyber-Security and Cyber-Risk Calibration. To analyze strategic interactions arising in the cyber-security context, we develop a new reputation game model in which an attacker can pretend to be a normal user and a defender may have to announce attack detection at a certain point of time without knowing whether he has been attacked. We show the existence and uniqueness of sequential equilibrium in Markov strategies, and explicitly characterize the players’ equilibrium strategies. Using our model, we suggest empirical and theoretical ways of calibrating the attack probability, which is an important element of cyber-risks. Bayesian learning. Cyber-security. Optimal stopping.

Investigating the effectiveness of a HyFlex cyber security training in a developing country: A case study. HyFlex termed as hybrid-flexibility is a teaching approach where teachers and students have the alternative to participate in planned courses either remotely or face-to-face. This study examines the effectiveness of the HyFlex pedagogical method to teach highly interactive digital and face-to-face cyber security training in Nigeria amidst the pandemic. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire from 113 participants to evaluate student’s perception towards the effectiveness of the Hyflex method using physical and Zoom teleconferencing which allow students to participate remotely in the cyber security training. The developed questionnaire comprising both open-ended and Likert-style questions was administered to purposely sampled participants. Findings from this study presents implementation details on how the HyFlex teaching model was implemented from a developing country context. Besides, findings present challenges and opportunities experienced with adopting the HyFlex pedagogical model, and also offers recommendations to other instructors for employing this teaching model. Findings also reveal that although there were challenges experienced by the students who attended via online such as connectivity issues, competency in using some features in Zoom-conferencing, etc. The students did appreciate the flexibility HyFlex teaching afforded, indicating that HyFlex is a promising teaching approach for fostering engagement of students especially in large-group cyber security courses.

SoREn, How Dynamic Software Update Tools Can Help Cybersecurity Systems to Improve Monitoring and Actions. Because stopping a service to apply updates raises issues, Dynamic Software Updating studies the application of updates on programs without disrupting the services they provide. This is acheived using specific mechanisms operating updating tasks such as the modification of the program state. To acheive transparency, Dynamic Software Updating systems use pre-selected and pre-configured mechanisms. Developers provide patches that are transparently converted to dynamic updates. The cost of such transparency is often that applied patches cannot modify the general semantic of the updated program. Allowing dynamic modification of the general semantic of a running program is rarely considered. In the context of protection of communications between moving vehicles and uncontrolled infras-tructure, SoREn (Security REconfigurable Engine) is designed to be dynamically reconfigurable. Its semantics can transparently be modified at runtime to change the security policy it enforces. Administrators can supply new policies to trigger a reconfiguration, without developing new components. This paper details and discusses the design of SoREn, its meta-model linked to cybersecurity business concepts and its automatic reconfiguration calculator allowing transparent application of reconfigurations. dynamic reconfiguration. dynamic software updating. quiescence. security. 
Cybersecurity In International Arbitration: How to Ease the Anxiety and Who Should Administer the Antidote?. Not so long ago, cyber-attacks were rare and mainly targeted large game entities, such as corporations, international organisations, and governmental and non-governmental institutions. After the hacking of both the Permanent Court of Arbitration website in 2015 and the Mossack Fonseca law firm in 2016, it became clear that neither arbitral proceedings and their stakeholders nor law firms are immune to cybercrimes. Considering the high worth and high stakes nature of disputes often referred to arbitration and the increasingly digitalised arbitration landscape, the rate of cyber-attacks targeting arbitral proceedings will predictably increase. Action must therefore be taken to bolster cybersecurity to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of the arbitral system. At the crux of this need, however, is who should be at the forefront in devising strategies to avert or mitigate cyber risks. This article explores why arbitral actors feel cybersecurity anxiety and why cybersecurity matters in the arbitral field. A comparison is then drawn between arbitral tribunals and institutions as to their respective competence in taking the lead on cybersecurity. The article ultimately concludes that the most effective way to tackle cyber risks in arbitration is an institutional lead that will contribute to the elevation of cyber literacy and the spread of risk awareness across the arbitral spectrum. 
Machine learning approach for intrusion detection systems as a cyber security strategy for Small and Medium Enterprises. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are businesses that account for a large percentage of the economy in many countries, but they lack cyber security. The present study examines different supervised machine learning methods with a focus on intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that will help in improving SMEs’ security. The algorithms that are tested through a real dataset, are Naïve Bayes, Sequential minimal optimization (SMO), C4.5 decision tree, and Random Forest. The experiments are run using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analyses (WEKA) 3.8.4 tools and the metrics used to evaluate the results were: accuracy, false-positive rate (FPR), and total time to train and build a classification model. The results obtained from the original dataset with 130 features show a high value of accuracy, but the computation time to build the classification model was notably high for the cases of C4.5 (1 hr. and 20 mins) and SMO algorithm (4 hrs. and 20 mins). the Information Gain (IG) method was used and the result was impressive. The time needed to train the model was reduced in the order of a few minutes and the accuracy was high (above 95%). In the end, challenges that SMEs can have for choosing an IDS such as lack of scalability and autonomic self-adaptation, can be solved by using a correct methodology with machine learning techniques.

Voluntary cybersecurity disclosure in the banking industry of Bangladesh: does board composition matter?. Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014–2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. Bangladesh. Banking industry. Board composition.

Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Neural Representation Learning: Experiments on E-Commerce and Cybersecurity. Learning predictive models in new domains with scarce training data is a growing challenge in modern supervised learning scenarios. This incentivizes developing domain adaptation methods that leverage the knowledge in known domains (source) and adapt to new domains (target) with a different probability distribution. This becomes more challenging when the source and target domains are in heterogeneous feature spaces, known as heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). While most HDA methods utilize mathematical optimization to map source and target data to a common space, they suffer from low transferability. Neural representations have proven to be more transferable. however, they are mainly designed for homogeneous environments. Drawing on the theory of domain adaptation, we propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous Adversarial Neural Domain Adaptation (HANDA), to effectively maximize the transferability in heterogeneous environments. HANDA conducts feature and distribution alignment in a unified neural network architecture and achieves domain invariance through adversarial kernel learning. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance against the state-of-the-art HDA methods on major image and text e-commerce benchmarks. HANDA shows statistically significant improvement in predictive performance. The practical utility of HANDA was shown in real-world dark web online markets. HANDA is an important step towards successful domain adaptation in e-commerce applications. IEEE. Adaptation models. adversarial kernel learning. dictionary learning. Domain adaptation.

Cybersecurity Awareness Based on Software and E-mail Security with Statistical Analysis. The aim of this study is to discover the impact of software security and e-mail security on overall cybersecurity among the students of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University in Dammam. Another main purpose to conduct this study is to know the level of knowledge students have in the developing countries about the cybersecurity and how much are they mindful of cyber-attacks and the level of awareness among the university students. Two important hypotheses were studied to discover their importance in awareness of cybersecurity. One is software security, and the other is e-mail security. A total of 11 relevant questions were drafted, and then these questions were distributed among the university students, and around 390 responded to the questionnaires. Statistical analysis was performed on the responses using tools. Initial tests such as validity and reliability test, feasibility test of a variable, correlation test, multicollinearity test, multiple regression, and Heteroskedasticity test were conducted using SPSS. And furthermore, multiple linear regression model and coefficient of determination, hypothesis test, ANOVA test, and partial test were conducted using ANOVA. The outcome of the analysis is software security variable (X1) that has a significant and positive effect on cybersecurity awareness (p value ≤0.001, β = 0.192). This shows that having a thorough understanding of software security can raise cybersecurity awareness up to 19.2%. E-mail security variable (X2) has a significant and positive effect on cybersecurityawareness (p-value ≤0.000). This shows that having a thorough understanding of email security can raise cybersecurity awareness up to 31.3%. Software security (X1) and e-mail security (X2) variables simultaneously have a significant effect on cybersecurity awareness (p-value ≤0.000) with a correlation coefficient of 12.1% (R2 = 0.121). This shows that the independent variable used can explain the level of cybersecurity awareness up to 12.1%. Research results show that students are aware of software or application updates. Furthermore, students' awareness of email security is also good. 
Explosive Cyber Security Threats During COVID-19 Pandemic and a Novel Tree-Based Broad Learning System to Overcome. The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has not only affected personal health and economy, but also revolutionized people's lifestyles. As more people turn to work and socialize online, the development of unmanned technologies based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as unmanned delivery, unmanned vehicles, unmanned transportation, etc., will become an inevitable trend. However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications. Unfortunately, the current intrusion detection methods based on machine learning still have weaknesses such as low accuracy and low efficiency when faced with unbalanced data distribution. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Tree-based BLS (TBLS) intrusion detection method according to the idea of ensemble learning and decision tree (CART and J48). The performance of TBLS was tested on the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset respectively, which contain a variety of malicious traffic types for attacks on the IoV. The results show that our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the existing 16 solutions. IEEE. Anomaly detection. broad learning system (BLS).

Student assessment in cybersecurity training automated by pattern mining and clustering. Hands-on cybersecurity training allows students and professionals to practice various tools and improve their technical skills. The training occurs in an interactive learning environment that enables completing sophisticated tasks in full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. During the training, the learning environment allows collecting data about trainees’ interactions with the environment, such as their usage of command-line tools. These data contain patterns indicative of trainees’ learning processes, and revealing them allows to assess the trainees and provide feedback to help them learn. However, automated analysis of these data is challenging. The training tasks feature complex problem-solving, and many different solution approaches are possible. Moreover, the trainees generate vast amounts of interaction data. This paper explores a dataset from 18 cybersecurity training sessions using data mining and machine learning techniques. We employed pattern mining and clustering to analyze 8834 commands collected from 113 trainees, revealing their typical behavior, mistakes, solution strategies, and difficult training stages. Pattern mining proved suitable in capturing timing information and tool usage frequency. Clustering underlined that many trainees often face the same issues, which can be addressed by targeted scaffolding. Our results show that data mining methods are suitable for analyzing cybersecurity training data. Educational researchers and practitioners can apply these methods in their contexts to assess trainees, support them, and improve the training design.

Enhancement of email spam detection using improved deep learning algorithms for cyber security. Email has sustained to be an essential part of our lives and as a means for better communication on the internet. The challenge pertains to the spam emails residing a large amount of space and bandwidth. The defect of state-of-The-Art spam filtering methods like misclassification of genuine emails as spam (false positives) is the rising challenge to the internet world. Depending on the classification techniques, literature provides various algorithms for the classification of email spam. This paper tactics to develop a novel spam detection model for improved cybersecurity. The proposed model involves several phases like dataset acquisition, feature extraction, optimal feature selection, and detection. Initially, the benchmark dataset of email is collected that involves both text and image datasets. Next, the feature extraction is performed using two sets of features like text features and visual features. In the text features, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is extracted. For the visual features, color correlogram and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) are determined. Since the length of the extracted feature vector seems to the long, the optimal feature selection process is done. The optimal feature selection is performed by a new meta-heuristic algorithm called Fitness Oriented Levy Improvement-based Dragonfly Algorithm (FLI-DA). Once the optimal features are selected, the detection is performed by the hybrid learning technique that is composed of two deep learning approaches named Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For improving the performance of existing deep learning approaches, the number of hidden neurons of RNN and CNN is optimized by the same FLI-DA. Finally, the optimized hybrid learning technique having CNN and RNN classifies the data into spam and ham. The experimental outcomes show the ability of the proposed method to perform the spam email classification based on improved deep learning. Convolutional Neural Network. Email spam detection.

Proliferation of Cyber Situational Awareness: Today's Truly Pervasive Drive of Cybersecurity. Situation awareness (SA) issues necessitate a comprehension of present activities, the ability to forecast, what will happen next, and strategies to assess the threat or impact of current internet activities and projections. These SA procedures are universal, domain-independent and can be used to detect cyber intrusions. This study introduces cyber situation awareness (CSA), its origin, conception, aim, and characteristics based on an analysis of function shortages and development requirements. Furthermore, we discussed the CSA research framework and examined the research history, which is the essential aspect, and assessed the present issues of the research as well.

The study then goes into detail regarding the core idea, assessment procedure, strengths, and weaknesses of novel approaches, and then, it addresses CSA from three perspectives: model, knowledge representation, and assessment methods. Many common approaches are contrasted, and current CSA application research in the realms of security, transmission, survivability, and system evaluation is discussed. Finally, this study summarized the findings of the present from technical and application systems, outlined CSA's future development directions, and provided adversary activities and information that can be used to improve an organization's SA operations. 
Quantum-Key-Distribution-Based Microgrid Control for Cybersecurity Enhancement. The integration of information and communication technologies has introduced cybersecurity challenges to microgrid (MG) apart from bringing more flexibility, reliability, and resilience. Especially in the upcoming quantum era, the existing cryptographic systems are vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. Motivated by these challenges, this article proposes a quantum-key-distribution (QKD)-based MG distributed control framework for cybersecurity enhancement. To defend the side-channel attacks and make the framework practical enough for industrial applications, measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) is introduced. The following contributions are made in this work. 1) A novel QKD-based quantum-secure control architecture is established to assure the data transmission security in MG distributed control. 2) MDI-QKD with asymmetric protocol is used to form a scalable QKD network for MG control. 3) A method for fast parameter optimization based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to adjust the parameters in QKD systems in real-time. Simulations are carried on a 13-bus MG to demonstrate the working principles of the proposed control scheme. The test results also prove the feasibility of the DNN-based parameter optimizer.

Cybersecurity decision support model to designing information technology security system based on risk analysis and cybersecurity framework. The proposed work was a recommendation model for designing cyber security decision support, in building an information technology security system based on risk analysis and the ISO/IEC 27001 cybersecurity framework. The proposed model aimed to obtain the best security system in mitigating security threats. This paper contributed to strategic policymakers in designing cyber security decision support recommendations to determine the best steps in designing information technology security systems. The model built can map the priority value of threat mitigation based on the relative threat score against the relative evaluation score of the implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 compliance. The mitigation priority value is the key in determining priority recommendations for building an information technology security system based on the ISO/IEC 27001 framework. Furthermore, the results implementation of information technology security system recommendations is tested by carrying out security attacks directly on the system being built. The work ends by conducting a statistical evaluation of the system built based on the recommendations of the information technology security system. The results achieved indicate an increase in the average value of the evaluation of ISO/IEC 27001 compliance from 36.27 to 82.37 with the p-value of Paired T-Test being 0.002138 < 0.05, meaning that there is a significant influence between threats to information technology security systems that implement and do not apply the recommendations of information technology security systems to the ISO/IEC 27001 compliance evaluation index value. Furthermore, based on 12 types of threat samples, it shows a decrease in the average threat criticality level from 8.75 to 4.00 with the p-value of the chi-square test being 0.0006605 < 0.05 and Fisher Test's p-value is 0.000008284 < 0.05, meaning that there is an association relationship between threats to information technology security systems that apply recommendations and do not apply recommendations to the criticality level of information technology security threats. While the results of the evaluation of the relationship between the implementation of security system recommendations on cybersecurity attack mitigation showed an increase in the effectiveness of cyber-attack mitigation from an average rating of 18.32 to 40.74 with the p-value of the chi-square test being 0.000005221 < 0.05 and the Fisher Test being 0.00000005658 < 0.05 means that there is an association relationship between systems that implement and do not implement recommendations based on ISO/IEC 27001 for cybersecurity attack mitigation.

Cybersecurity Attacks on Software Logic and Error Handling Within AIS Implementations: A Systematic Testing of Resilience. To increase situational awareness of maritime vessels and other entities and to enable their exchange of various information, the International Maritime Organization mandated the use of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in 2004. The AIS is a self-reporting system that uses the VHF radio link. However, any radio-based self-reporting system is prone to forgery, especially in situations where authentication of the message is not designed into the architecture. As AIS was designed in the 1990s when cyberattacks were in their infancy, it does not implement authentication or encryption. thus, it can be seen as fundamentally vulnerable against cyberattacks. This paper demonstrates and evaluates the impact of multiple cyberattacks on AIS via remote radio frequency (RF) links using transmission-enabled software-defined radio (SDR). Overall, we implemented and tested a total of 11 different tests/attacks on 19 AIS setups, using a controlled environment. The tested configurations were derived from heterogeneous platforms such as Windows, Android, generic receivers, and commercial transponders. Our aim is to enhance the early discovery of new vulnerabilities in AIS to effectively address AIS attacks in the nearest future. The results showed that approximately 89% of the setups were affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at the AIS protocol level. Besides implementing some existing attack ideas (e.g., spoofing, DoS, and flooding), we showed some novel attack concepts in the AIS context such as a coordinated attack, overwhelming alerts, and logical vulnerabilities, all of which have the potential to cause software/system crashes in the worst-case scenarios. Moreover, an implementation/specification flaw related to the AIS preamble was identified during the experiments, which may affect the interoperability of different AIS devices. The error-handling system in AIS was also investigated. Unlike the aviation sector's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), the maritime sector's AIS does not effectively support any error correction method, which may contribute to RF pollution and less effective use of the overall system. The consistency of our results for a comprehensive range of hardware-software configurations indicated the reliability of our approach, test system, and evaluation results.

Cybersecurity Enhancement for Multi-Infeed High-Voltage DC Systems. Composed of multiple two-terminal high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission systems, a multi-infeed HVDC (MIDC) system exchanges massive power among multiple asynchronous AC systems. However, as an intrinsically cyber-physical system, an MIDC system could suffer from cyber-attacks, leading to massive power mismatches in multiple AC systems, and resulting in catastrophic consequences. Since the sequential responses of an MIDC system and interconnected AC systems are in different timescales, this paper first establishes a two-timescale model to evaluate the sequential impacts caused by cyber-attacks. Then, an event-triggered cyber-defense strategy is proposed to enhance the cybersecurity of an MIDC system by mitigating multiple non-simultaneous cyber-attacks. Whenever new cyber-attack events occur, the proposed cyber-defense strategy, which is mathematically modeled as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, is executed on-line and updated in an event-triggered manner. Simulation results on an MIDC system demonstrate that the low-cost and almost blind cyber-attacks can cause severe frequency deviations, and the proposed strategy can mitigate multi-cyber-attacks effectively.

Challenges in Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. Cybersecurity challenges are increasing in complexity and intensity. There is a need for cybersecurity to evolve and allow cyber defenders to win against hackers’ ever-changing attacks. The latest advances in artificial intelligence bring an optimistic approach to use different methods like machine learning algorithms. However, many of those methods lack accuracy and their security is not well studied. They handle huge volumes of data of different types and they can be as well vulnerable to cyber attacks. Moreover, the perpetrators are also interested in using machine learning techniques for their bad deeds. This paper entails both opportunities and challenges of machine learning in the age of cybersecurity. The motivation is for cybersecurity professionals to assess and improve tools that use machine learning, and to support research of new ontologies. Adversial Attacks. Cybersecurity.

A Blockchain-Based Architecture for Enabling Cybersecurity in the Internet-of-Critical Infrastructures. Due to the drastic increase in the number of critical infrastructures like nuclear plants, industrial control systems (ICS), transportation, it becomes highly vulnerable to several attacks. They become the major targets of cyberattacks due to the increase in number of interconnections with other networks. Several research works have focused on the design of intrusion detection systems (IDS) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. At the same time, Blockchain (BC) technology can be applied to improve the security level. In order to resolve the security issues that exist in the critical infrastructures and ICS, this study designs a novel BC with deep learning empowered cyber-attack detection (BDLE-CAD) in critical infrastructures and ICS. The proposed BDLE-CAD technique aims to identify the existence of intrusions in the network. In addition, the presented enhanced chimp optimization based feature selection (ECOA-FS) technique is applied for the selection of optimal subset of features. Moreover, the optimal deep neural network (DNN) with search and rescue (SAR) optimizer is applied for the detection and classification of intrusions. Furthermore, a BC enabled integrity checking scheme (BEICS) has been presented to defend against the misrouting attacks. The experimental result analysis of the BDLE-CAD technique takes place and the results are inspected under varying aspects. The simulation analysis pointed out the supremacy of the BDLE-CAD technique over the recent state of art techniques with the accuy of 92.63%. BC. Deep learning. Deep neural network. Ids.

Cyber Security Analysis and Evaluation for Intrusion Detection Systems. Machine learning is a technique that is widely employed in both the academic and industrial sectors all over the world. Machine learning algorithms that are intuitive can analyse risks and respond swiftly to breaches and security issues. It is crucial in offering a proactive security system in the field of cybersecurity. In real time, cybersecurity protects information, information systems, and networks from intruders. In the recent decade, several assessments on security and privacy estimates have noted a rapid growth in both the incidence and quantity of cybersecurity breaches. At an increasing rate, intruders are breaching information security. Anomaly detection, software vulnerability diagnosis, phishing page identification, denial of service assaults, and malware identification are the foremost cyber-security concerns that require efficient clarifications. Practitioners have tried a variety of approaches to address the present cybersecurity obstacles and concerns. In a similar vein, the goal of this research is to assess the idealness of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems under fuzzy conditions using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal-Solutions (TOPSIS). Fuzzy sets are ideal for dealing with decision-making scenarios in which experts are unsure of the best course of action. The projected work would support practitioners in identifying, prioritising, and selecting cybersecurityrelated attributes for intrusion detection systems, allowing them to design more optimal and effective intrusion detection systems.

Roadmap for Cybersecurity in Autonomous Vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are on the horizon and will be transforming transportation safety and comfort. These vehicles will be connected to various external systems and utilize advanced embedded systems to perceive their environment and make intelligent decisions. However, this increased connectivity makes these vehicles vulnerable to various cyber-attacks that can have catastrophic effects. Attacks on automotive systems are already on the rise in todays vehicles and are expected to become more commonplace in future autonomous vehicles. Thus, there is a need to strengthen cybersecurity in future autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss major automotive cyber-attacks over the past decade and present state-of-the-art solutions that leverage artificial intelligence (AI). We propose a roadmap towards building secure autonomous vehicles and highlight key open challenges that need to be addressed. IEEE. Artificial intelligence. Automotive engineering.

On the Cybersecurity of Traffic Signal Control System With Connected Vehicles. Connected vehicle (CV) technology brings both opportunities and challenges to the traffic signal control (TSC) system. While safety and mobility performance could be greatly improved by adopting CV technologies, the connectivity between vehicles and transportation infrastructure may increase the risks of cyber threats. In the past few years, studies related to cybersecurity on the TSC systems were conducted. However, there still lacks a systematic investigation that provides a comprehensive analysis framework. In this study, our aim is to fill the research gap by proposing a comprehensive analysis framework for the cybersecurity problem of the TSC in the CV environment. With potential threats towards the major components of the system and their corresponding impacts on safety and efficiency analyzed, data spoofing attack is considered the most plausible and realistic attack approach. Based on this finding, different attack strategies and defense solutions are discussed.

Cyber Security: A Review of Cyber Crimes, Security Challenges and Measures to Control. The proliferation of the Internet’s interconnections has led to a substantial increase in cyberattack incidents, often with devastating and grave consequences for the organizations and their associated clientele. The pandemic of COVID-19 has pushed most organizations towards digital transformation. The higher dependence of a firm on digital infrastructure makes it more vulnerable to cyber-crimes. The existing literature suggests that the most notable and frequently chosen weapons of attackers are Internet of things (IoT) attacks, phishing attack, malware attack, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack and structured query language (SQL) injection attack. In this study, an attempt has been made to generate a protection framework from these cyberattacks. In doing so, the present research has adopted a systematic stepwise process of investigation. The research method consists of four components. First, through bibliometric analysis in VOSviewer, authors identified the scope for searching the related literature published worldwide and generated visualization for comprehension. This step led to the selection of 60 research articles for further analysis. After that, each security threat’s MAXQDA software word tree was developed, representing its linkages with possible security solutions and control measures. Lastly, they adopted expert elicitation protocol through semi-structured interviews with six corporate IT experts and five academic experts. The synthesis of information gathered leads to the development of a suggestive protection framework for the organizations. Bibliometric Analysis. Cyber Security. Cyber Threats. Word Tree. 
GDL90fuzz: Fuzzing - GDL-90 Data Interface Specification Within Aviation Software and Avionics Devices-A Cybersecurity Pentesting Perspective. As the core technology of next-generation air transportation systems, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is becoming very popular. However, many (if not most) ADS-B devices and implementations support and rely on Garmin's Datalink 90 (GDL-90) protocol for data exchange and encapsulation. This makes it essential to investigate the integrity of the GDL-90 protocol especially against attacks on the core subsystem availability, such as denial-of-service (DoS), which pose high risks to safety-critical and mission-critical systems such as in avionics and aerospace. In this paper, we consider GDL-90 protocol fuzzing options and demonstrate practical DoS attacks on popular electronic flight bag (EFB) software operating on mobile devices. Then we present our own specially configured avionics pentesting platform and the GDL-90 protocol. We captured legitimate traffic from ADS-B avionics devices. We ran our samples through the state-of-the-art fuzzing platform American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and fed the AFL's output to EFB apps and the GDL-90 decoding software via the network in the same manner as legitimate GDL-90 traffic would be sent from ADS-B and other avionics devices. The results showed worrying and critical lack of security in many EFB applications where the security is directly related to the aircraft's safe navigation. Out of the 16 tested configurations, our avionics pentesting platform managed to crash or otherwise impact 9 (56%). The observed problems manifested as crashes, hangs, and abnormal behaviors of the EFB apps and GDL-90 decoders during the fuzzing test. Our developed and proposed systematic pentesting methodology for avionics devices, protocols, and software can be used to discover and report vulnerabilities as early as possible.

The impact of cybersecurity on the financial sector in Jamaica. Purpose: Jamaica continues to experience financial crimes particularly in cyberspace including e-fraud, identity theft, credit card forging, money laundering and terrorist activities. Spoofing, spamming, virus propagation, spear phishing, buffer overflow and denial of service continue to be weaknesses found in organization’s cybersecurity in Jamaica. With the emergence of cryptocurrency and digital currency it is important that Jamaica uses intelligence led policing and data analysis to reduce and prevent financial crimes such as money laundering and corruption proceeds. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review. review of domestic legislation. review of current matters in courts. Findings: Cybersecurity is no longer a pure computer security issue but instead, cybersecurity is seen as a national policy matter because the illicit use of cyberspace could have a significant impact on the financial sector in Jamaica. Cyberattacks have been successfully targeting the financial sector worldwide. While much of the efforts and resources to address the risk imposed by these cyberattacks are directed at developed economies, far less attention has been devoted to developing nations. Because many of these nations such as Jamaica have modest cyber capabilities, their ability to respond to cyberattacks can be limited, yet they need to respond to these attacks to protect their critical financial infrastructure. Originality/value: There are few scholarly articles that focus on cybersecurity issues and legislation in Jamaica. Cybersecurity. Financial crime. Jamaica.

Pathways to Cybersecurity Awareness and Protection Behaviors in South Korea. Cybersecurity awareness plays an important role in the human arena of cybersecurity. Using a nationally representative South Korean sample, this current study examines two pathways leading to enhanced cybersecurity protection behaviors in relation to cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity risks. In addition, this study aims to identify generational differences between pathways. Data were derived from Information Security Survey, which is the latest public access survey on this topic. The study found that cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity risk have a positive association with cybersecurity behaviors. In a multigroup analysis, the influence of cybersecurity risk on cybersecurity behaviors was statistically significant for all generational groups. Across the younger generation, acceptance of cybersecurity risk was more influenced by cybersecurity protection behaviors, while cybersecurity awareness became more important for the older generation. Practical, policy, and research implications for increasing cybersecurity awareness and risk to promote safe cybersecurity protection behaviors are also discussed.

An integrated cyber security risk management framework and risk predication for the critical infrastructure protection. Cyber security risk management plays an important role for today’s businesses due to the rapidly changing threat landscape and the existence of evolving sophisticated cyber attacks. It is necessary for organisations, of any size, but in particular those that are associated with a critical infrastructure, to understand the risks, so that suitable controls can be taken for the overall business continuity and critical service delivery. There are a number of works that aim to develop systematic processes for risk assessment and management. However, the existing works have limited input from threat intelligence properties and evolving attack trends, resulting in limited contextual information related to cyber security risks. This creates a challenge, especially in the context of critical infrastructures, since attacks have evolved from technical to socio-technical and protecting against them requires such contextual information. This research proposes a novel integrated cyber security risk management (i-CSRM) framework that responds to that challenge by supporting systematic identification of critical assets through the use of a decision support mechanism built on fuzzy set theory, by predicting risk types through machine learning techniques, and by assessing the effectiveness of existing controls. The framework is composed of a language, a process, and it is supported by an automated tool. The paper also reports on the evaluation of our work to a real case study of a critical infrastructure. The results reveal that using the fuzzy set theory in assessing assets' criticality, our work supports stakeholders towards an effective risk management by assessing each asset's criticality. Furthermore, the results have demonstrated the machine learning classifiers’ exemplary performance to predict different risk types including denial of service, cyber espionage and crimeware.

Attacking the trust machine: Developing an information systems research agenda for blockchain cybersecurity. Blockchain-based systems become increasingly attractive targets for cybercrime due to the rising amount of value transacted in respective systems. However, a comprehensive overview of existing attack vectors and a directive discussion of resulting research opportunities are missing. Employing a structured literature review, we extract and analyze 87 relevant attacks on blockchain-based systems and assign them to common attack vectors. We subsequently derive a research framework and agenda for information systems research on the cybersecurity of blockchain-based systems. We structure our framework along the users, developers, and attackers of both blockchain applications and blockchain infrastructure, highlighting the reciprocal relationships between these entities. Our results show that especially socio-technical aspects of blockchain cybersecurity are underrepresented in research and require further attention. Blockchain. IT Security. Research agenda.

Blockchain-aided Integrated Edge Framework of Cybersecurity for Internet of Things. The Blockchain is one of the most promising and artistic cybersecurity solutions. It has been practiced in a variety of reinforcements, including healthcare, transportation, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, Blockchain has a colossal scalability challenge, limiting its ability to control services with high transaction volumes. Edge computing, on the other hand, was designed to allow cloud services and resources to be deployed at the network's edge, although it now faces issues in terms of decentralized security and management. The unification of edge computing and Blockchain within one solution jar provides a vast scale of storage systems, database servers, and authenticity computation towards the end in a safe fashion. Despite the potential of interconnected edge computing and Blockchain environments, difficulties such as scalability, resource management, function integration, self-organization, and new security concerns must be addressed before broad adoption. This article provides an overview of the secure IoT framework, paradigms, enablers, and security problems of combining Blockchain and intelligent edge computing.

Cybersecurity Enterprises Policies: A Comparative Study. Cybersecurity is a critical issue that must be prioritized not just by enterprises of all kinds, but also by national security. To safeguard an organization’s cyberenvironments, information, and communication technologies, many enterprises are investing substantially in cybersecurity these days. One part of the cyberdefense mechanism is building an enterprises’ security policies library, for consistent implementation of security controls. Significant and common cybersecurity policies of various enterprises are compared and explored in this study to provide robust and comprehensive cybersecurity knowledge that can be used in various enterprises. Several significant common security policies were identified and discussed in this comprehensive study. This study identified 10 common cybersecurity policy aspects in five enterprises: healthcare, finance, education, aviation, and e-commerce. We aimed to build a strong infrastructure in each business, and investigate the security laws and policies that apply to all businesses in each sector. Furthermore, the findings of this study reveal that the importance of cybersecurity requirements differ across multiple organizations. The choice and applicability of cybersecurity policies are determined by the type of information under control and the security requirements of organizations in relation to these policies.

Agile Approaches for Cybersecurity Systems, IoT and Intelligent Transportation. To adapt to the rapidly increasing vulnerabilities in software products and cyber threats that exploit them, security professionals are actively working with software developers to produce more secure systems. In software development, agile methods are increasingly adopted in critical software projects where security risks are prominent challenges. This adoption stems from the fact that agile methods are highly iterative and support delivering services and products in smaller batches which allows security professionals to seamlessly integrate software development security activities with agile methodologies. In addition, the iterative nature of agile software development encourages frequent inspections, tests, and patching of software systems to mitigate cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. Considering the massive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) products, the challenge of software development while addressing the security and safety concerns of these devices will continue to increase. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed review of agile software development in the context of IoT, ITS, and their cybersecurity and risk challenges. Furthermore, we provide a systematic comparison of the reviewed literature based on a set of defined criteria. Finally, we provide a broader outlook and an outline for designing future security-enhanced agile software development solutions for IoT and ITS systems. Adaptation models. Computer security.

Attacks to Automatous Vehicles: A Deep Learning Algorithm for Cybersecurity. Rapid technological development has changed drastically the automotive industry. Network communication has improved, helping the vehicles transition from completely machine-to software-controlled technologies. The autonomous vehicle network is controlled by the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. Nevertheless, the autonomous vehicle network still has issues and weaknesses concerning cybersecurity due to the complexity of data and traffic behaviors that benefit the unauthorized intrusion to a CAN bus and several types of attacks. Therefore, developing systems to rapidly detect message attacks in CAN is one of the biggest challenges. This study pre-sents a high-performance system with an artificial intelligence approach that protects the vehicle network from cyber threats. The system secures the autonomous vehicle from intrusions by using deep learning approaches. The proposed security system was verified by using a real automatic vehicle network dataset, including spoofing, flood, replaying attacks, and benign packets. Prepro-cessing was applied to convert the categorical data into numerical. This dataset was processed by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and a hybrid network combining CNN and long short-term memory (CNN–LSTM) models to identify attack messages. The results revealed that the model achieved high performance, as evaluated by the metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The proposed system achieved high accuracy (97.30%). Along with the empirical demon-stration, the proposed system enhanced the detection and classification accuracy compared with the existing systems and was proven to have superior performance for real-time CAN bus security.

Analyzing the impact of cybersecurity on monitoring and control systems in the energy sector. Monitoring and control systems in the energy sector are specialized information structures that are not governed by the same information technology standards as the rest of the world’s information systems. Such industrial control systems are also used to handle important infrastructures, including smart grids, oil and gas facilities, nuclear power plants, water management systems, and so on. Industry equipment is handled by systems connected to the internet, either via wireless or cable connectivity, in the present digital age. Further, the system must work without fail, with the system’s availability rate being of paramount importance. Furthermore, to certify that the system is not subject to a cyber-attack, the entire system must be safeguarded against cyber security vulnerabilities, threats, and hazards. In addition, the article looks at and evaluates cyber security evaluations for industrial control systems, as well as their possible impact on the accessibility of industrial control system operations in the energy sector. This research work discovers that the hesitant fuzzy-based method of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is an operational procedure for estimating industrial control system cyber security assessments by understanding the numerous characteristics and their impacts on cyber security industrial control systems. The author evaluated the outputs of six distinct projects to determine the quality of the outcomes and their sensitivity. According to the results of the robustness analysis, alternative 1 shows the utmost effective cybersecurity project for the industrial control system.

Computer science beyond coding: Partnering to create teacher cybersecurity microcredentials. Computer science, cybersecurity education, and microcredentials are becoming more pervasive in all levels of the educational system. The purpose of this study was partnering with precollegiate teachers: (1) to investigate the self-efficacy of 30 precollegiate teacher participants towards computer science before, during, and after three iterations of a cybersecurity microcredential, and (2) to make changes to the cybersecurity microcredential to improve its effectiveness. The authors explored what teachers need in a microcredential. The first Cohort (n = 5) took the microcredential sequence over 28 days in the summer of 2020, the second Cohort (n = 16) took it over 42 days in the fall of 2020, and the third Cohort (n = 9) took it over 49 days in the summer of 2021. The authors investigated three research questions and used a systems thinking approach while developing, evaluating, and implementing the research study. The researchers used quantitative methods in the collection of a self-efficacy subscale survey to assess whether the precollegiate teachers’ beliefs about computer science changed, and then used qualitative methods when conducting semi-structured teacher participant interviews to address the research questions. The findings show that the prec-ollegiate teachers’ self-efficacy scores towards computer science increased, and that there are areas in need of attention, such as resources and implementation, when creating microcredentials. The implications of this research include the importance of purposefully crafting microcredentials and professional developments, including aspects of creating effective partnerships. Coding.

Reversal of pixel rotation: A reversible data hiding system towards cybersecurity in encrypted images. Due to privacy and security concerns, the researches of reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) have become increasingly important. Conventional schemes vacate the spare room after image encryption (VRAE) suffer from the low embedding rate, high error rate of data extraction, and imperfect image recovery. To address these issues, we propose a separable reversible data hiding scheme for encrypted images that utilizes a novel pixel rotation technique to embed data into fully encrypted images. The block complexities of four decrypted rotation states are considered when recovering image. To realize perfect image recovery, we further devise a lossless version (LPR-RDHEI). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PR-RDHEI scheme achieves an embedding rate of 0.4994 bpp on average and ensures lossless data extraction. Meanwhile, the proposed LPR-RDHEI scheme still has a 0.4494 bpp embedding rate on average. The embedding rates of our two schemes are significantly improved compared with state-of-the-arts.

Cyber security in IoT-based cloud computing: A comprehensive survey. Cloud computing provides the flexible architecture where data and resources are dispersed at various locations and are accessible from various industrial environments. Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms’ challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models. the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail. we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks. we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective. we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.

A Cybersecurity Risk Framework for Unmanned Aircraft Systems under Specific Category. Nowadays, safety and cybersecurity are some of the most important issues involving the development of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations. For safety, the lawmakers and aviation authorities have a lot of efforts to establish an adequate safety level for UAS operations within the current airspace system. One of them is the Specific Operation Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology developed by Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Aircraft System (JARUS). This methodology provides a guide to conduct risk assessments for UAS operations under the Specific Category. However, the methodology supports only some problems related to safety. In this paper, we introduce our approach to extend the SORA methodology toward cybersecurity. We illustrate this approach by extending the methodology to cover the privacy problem - an aspect related to cybersecurity. Besides that, we also introduce our supporting tool in the form of a web application that helps users conduct automatic risk assessments. Cybersecurity. Privacy. risk assessment. SORA.

Parallel anomaly detection algorithm for cybersecurity on the highspeed train control system. With the rapid development of the high-speed train industry, the high-speed train control system has now been exposed to a complicated network environment full of dangers. This paper provides a speculative parallel data detection algorithm to rapidly detect the potential threats and ensure data transmission security in the railway network. At first, the structure of the high-speed train control data received by the railway control center was analyzed and divided tentatively into small chunks to eliminate the inside dependencies. Then the traditional threat detection algorithm based on deterministic finite automaton was reformed by the speculative parallel optimization so that the inline relationship's influences that affected the data detection order could be avoided. At last, the speculative parallel detection algorithm would inspect the divided data chunks on a distributed platform. With the help of both the speculative parallel technique and the distributed platform, the detection deficiency for train control data was improved significantly. The results showed that the proposed algorithm exhibited better performance and scalability when compared with the traditional, non-parallel detection method, and massive train control data could be inspected and processed promptly. Now it has been proved by practical use that the proposed algorithm was stable and reliable. Our local train control center was able to quickly detect the anomaly and make a fast response during the train control data transmission by adopting the proposed algorithm. Control system.

Automatic Narrative Summarization for Visualizing Cyber Security Logs and Incident Reports. Cyber security logs and incident reports describe a narrative, but in practice analysts view the data in tables where it can be difficult to follow the narrative. Narrative visualizations are useful, but common examples use a summarized narrative instead of the full story's narrative. it is unclear how to automatically generate these summaries. This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. Together, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Misérables character interaction graph. We find that the list of main characters in the automatically generated summary has substantial agreement with human-generated summaries.

Cyber security challenges in aviation communication, navigation, and surveillance. As the aviation sector becomes digitized and increasingly reliant on wireless technology, so has its attractiveness to cyber attackers including nation-state actors and terrorists. For example, vulnerabilities in the broad range of interconnected devices and (sub)systems, their implementations, as well as design flaws, can be exploited to carry out nefarious activities. Therefore, in this paper we review the existing literature to understand the diverse attack vectors associated with communication, navigation, and surveillance systems, and how some of these security issues can be mitigated. Although a number of survey and review articles have analyzed various wireless technologies in aviation, to the best of our knowledge, no work has systematically analyzed them from communication, navigation and surveillance perspectives collectively. Furthermore, we present potential software defined radio (SDR)-based attacks targeting popular wireless technologies. Based on our in-depth review, we highlight existing limitations and discuss potential research opportunities. Aviation. Communication. Navigation. Security. Software defined radio (SDR).

A systemic framework for addressing cybersecurity in construction. Today, the built environment is designed, built, and managed using digital technology, making it increasingly exposed to cyber security risks. Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures.

Deep learning empowered cybersecurity spam bot detection for online social networks. Cybersecurity encompasses various elements such as strategies, policies, processes, and techniques to accomplish availability, confidentiality, and integrity of resource processing, network, software, and data from attacks. In this scenario, the rising popularity of Online Social Networks (OSN) is under threat from spammers for which effective spam bot detection approaches should be developed. Earlier studies have developed different approaches for the detection of spam bots in OSN. But those techniques primarily concentrated on hand-crafted features to capture the features of malicious users while the application of Deep Learning (DL) models needs to be explored. With this motivation, the current research article proposes a Spam Bot Detection technique using Hybrid DL model abbreviated as SBD-HDL. The proposed SBD-HDL technique focuses on the detection of spam bots that exist in OSNs. The technique has different stages of operations such as pre-processing, classification, and parameter optimization. Besides, SBD-HDL technique hybridizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for spam bot classification process. In order to enhance the detection performance of GCN-RNN model, hyperparameters are tuned using Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA). Both hybridization of GCN-RNN and LOA-based hyperparameter tuning process make the current work, a first-of-its-kind in this domain. The experimental validation of the proposed SBD-HDL technique, conducted upon benchmark dataset, established the supremacy of the technique since it was validated under different measures.

New challenges in supply chain management: cybersecurity across the supply chain. Recent cybersecurity breaches have highlighted the resulting economic, political, and social effects. These incidents highlight that cybersecurity is now a supply chain issue. This should not be surprising given the interconnected digital world that defines organisational ecosystems. Due to their relative ‘newness’, coupled with the complexity of both supply chains and cybersecurity, there is lack of clarity and gaps in the current knowledge base regarding cybersecurity across the supply chain. At the same time, this issue is of critical importance to both practitioners and researchers, and thus needs to be structured in such a way to facilitate a common understanding of what cybersecurity across the supply chain cybersecurity entails and the subsequent research opportunities. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to develop a research framework for cybersecurity across the supply chain to guide future research. An exploratory research methodology was applied, which relied on multiple sources to develop the research framework, including structured literature reviews, anecdotal evidence, interviews with subject matter experts, and external validation by both practitioners and researchers. The paper concludes by identifying areas that demand further research and with a call for more research on cybersecurity across the supply chain. cybersecurity. new challenges in supply chain management: supply chain cybersecurity. research issues. risk management. small to medium sized enterprises.

The rise of cybersecurity warriors?. The increasing demand for cybersecurity has been met by a global supply, namely, a rapidly growing market of private companies that offer their services worldwide. Cybersecurity firms develop both defensive (e.g. protection of own networks) and offensive innovations (e.g. development of zero days), whereby they provide operational capacities and expertise to overstrained states. Yet, there is hardly any systematic knowledge of these new cybersecurity warriors to date. Who are they, and how can we differentiate them? This contribution to the special issue seeks to give an initial overview of the coordination between public and private actors in cyberspace. I thus explore these new private security forces by mapping the emerging market for these goods and services. The analysis develops a generic typology from a newly generated data set of almost one hundred companies. As a result of this stock-taking exercise, I suggest how to theorize public-private coordination as network relationships in order to provide a number of preliminary insights into the rise of this ‘brave new industry’ and to point out critical implications for the future of private security forces.

Unfortunately, the spoofing attack, a kind of cyber-risk, has increased the number of cyber-criminals in data transfer applications without being detected, especially in smart cities. Several applications based on online video communications, such as online testing and video conferences, are involved in smart cities. The video displays various variations of a person, which makes face recognition an important concept in security implementation. The face spoofing attacks are mainly based on the person's face replication by replaying a video or by printed photos. Therefore, video forgery detection and related spoof attack detection have become a new topic in cybersecurity research. From this perspective, this paper presents a deep learning approach for video face forensic detection with a cyber facial spoofing attack using two methodologies. The first methodology is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input video frames. The model has five convolutional layers followed by five pooling layers. The second methodology is based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). This model comprises two pooling layers, two convolutional layers, and a convolutional LSTM layer. Each methodology includes a fully-connected layer to interconnect between the feature map resulting from the feature extraction process and the classification layer. A SoftMax layer performs the classification task in each method. This paper aims to achieve an optimum modality for face forensic detection to overcome spoofing attacks. Simulation results reveal that the ConvLSTM with CNN methodology achieves better classification results as the extracted features are more comprehensive than those of other conventional approaches. Also, it achieves an accuracy of 99%, and the works presented in the literature achieve an accuracy levels up to 95%. Cloud. CNN. ConvLSTM. Cybersecurity. Deep learning. Forensics detection.

Controlled Mode Distinguishability for Cybersecurity. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are a class of systems integrating cyber and physical components, and their security issues have gained a lot of attention in recent years. CPSs are modeled as hybrid systems in this letter since the logical and physical behaviors of CPS can be mapped to the discrete-state and continuous-state dynamics of the hybrid system, respectively. Motivated by the importance of situation awareness in an adversarial environment, we consider the mode distinguishability problem for a class of hybrid systems that can describe compromised CPSs. It is found that even though some modes of the hybrid system may not be distinguishable without knowing the attack inputs, the modes could be controlled distinguishable, which means their behaviors can be differentiated under certain control inputs. In this letter, the characterization of controlled distinguishability is studied, and the problem of finding control inputs for mode identification is proposed. Hybrid systems. switched systems. 
Asset criticality and risk prediction for an effective cybersecurity risk management of cyber-physical system. Risk management plays a vital role in tackling cyber threats within the cyber-physical system (CPS). It enables identifying critical assets, vulnerabilities and threats and determining suitable proactive control measures for the risk mitigation. However, due to the increased complexity of the CPS, cyber-attacks nowadays are more sophisticated and less predictable, which makes risk management task more challenging. This paper aims for an effective cybersecurity risk management (CSRM) practice using assets criticality, predication of risk types and evaluating the effectiveness of existing controls. We follow a number of techniques for the proposed unified approach including fuzzy set theory for the asset criticality, machine learning classifiers for the risk predication and comprehensive assessment model (CAM) for evaluating the effectiveness of the existing controls. The proposed approach considers relevant CSRM concepts such as asset, threat actor, attack pattern, tactic, technique and procedure (TTP), and controls and maps these concepts with the VERIS community dataset (VCDB) features for the risk predication. The experimental results reveal that using the fuzzy set theory in assessing assets criticality supports stakeholder for an effective risk management practice. Furthermore, the results have demonstrated the machine learning classifiers exemplary performance to predict different risk types including denial of service, cyber espionage and crimeware. An accurate prediction of risk can help organisations to determine the suitable controls in proactive manner to manage the risk. Control. Cyber-physical system. Cybersecurity risk management.

Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) and the Role of its 5 Pillars. Computer crime is a matter of increasing concern, and worldwide action is required if the proper responses to it are to be found. One of the tools that can be deployed here is the Global cybersecurity index (GCI), a control and feedback mechanism based on a composite indicator. The GCI is based on a hierarchy of sub-indicators. The indicators used for the final aggregation of the CGI are called pillars. Five pillars are applied to rank the eleven countries that are top of the rankings in a worldwide study. In this paper, our ranking is based on these pillars, and their role is investigated using partial order methodology. It turns out that the pillars Technical (aspects), Capacity building, and Cooperation are of particular importance. In conclusion, a strategy is suggested for an individualized ranking that may be helpful for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or other institutions. Here, we apply the procedure for the project Awareness Laboratory SME (ALARM) information security and put our ideas up for discussion. In particular, the mathematical method will be transferred to SMEs as a means to support the effectiveness of awareness-raising measures and to improve the security behaviour of company employees.

Varieties of public–private co-governance on cybersecurity within the digital trade: implications from Huawei’s 5G. Cybersecurity is becoming an increasing hurdle for digital trade. The governance of cybersecurity in the global digital trade system is a bottom-up approach, where governments are implementing fragmental and inconsistent trade policies and forming different models of public–private co-governance. Based on network-governance theory, information security behavior theory, and international risk theory, we develop a conceptual model to investigate how various factors drive cybersecurity governance practices. Using Huawei’s 5G as an example, this study explores how different governments—the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and India—act on the cybersecurity concerns from Huawei’s 5G. The comparative analysis demonstrates how balancing different factors drive governments' actions and discuss what international corporations like Huawei can do to align their digital trade system strategies. This research guides international firms to participate in cybersecurity governance constructions within the digital trade system. case study. cybersecurity governance.

Balancing cybersecurity in a supply chain under direct and indirect cyber risks. Cybersecurity is an essential requirement for the sustainability of global supply chains. In this paper, a stochastic programming formulation is presented for optimisation of cybersecurity investment and selection of security controls to mitigate and balance the impact of direct and indirect (propagated) cyber risks in a multi-tier supply chain. Using a network transformation combined with the first-order Taylor series approximation of natural logarithm to linearise the nonlinear constraints, a nonlinear stochastic combinatorial optimisation model is approximated by its linear equivalent. The problem objective is to determine an optimal cybersecurity investment under limited budget and portfolio of security controls for each supply chain node to balance the cybersecurity over the entire supply chain. The minmax objective functions are applied to minimise either the maximum breach probability or the maximum loss of supply chain nodes. Alternatively, maxmin objectives are used to maximise either the minimum non-breach probability or the minimum saving of loss. The proposed integrated modelling approach is illustrated with results of computational study and a comparison of approximated and exact solution values is presented. The decision-making insights are provided and discussed.

New Aspects of Integrity Levels in Automotive Industry-Cybersecurity of Automated Vehicles. The spread of connected vehicles is expected to multiply the effects of the growing penetration of cyberspace in our life, and with this it remarkably influences the vulnerability of society to cyberattacks in an unfavorable way. Accordingly, ZalalZone-the Hungarian test track-has set up a working group to support the necessary methodological background for cybersecurity-related validation processes for the automotive industry. Therefore the paper aims to reconsider safety integrity levels in the automotive industry related to the field of cybersecurity. Following this, the article provides a comprehensive structure of integrity levels that serves the safety requirements of nowadays new cybersecurity challenges. To adapt the new cybersecurity integrity level architecture to the conventional automotive safety integrity level framework, the authors have verified a specific clustering model. To validate the aggregated probability of the possible cyberattack alternatives, the generated new cybersecurity rating scale is compared with the ASIL probability values by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In the final step of the analysis, the possible practical application of the new framework is presented based on the identification of the derived probability value in the case of the investigated failure mode.

A linear model for optimal cybersecurity investment in Industry 4.0 supply chains. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming formulation for optimisation of cybersecurity investment in Industry 4.0 supply chains. Using a recursive linearisation procedure, a complex nonlinear stochastic combinatorial optimisation model with a classical exponential function of breach probability is transformed into its linear equivalent. The obtained linear optimisation model is capable of selecting optimal portfolio of security safeguards to minimise cybersecurity investment and expected cost of losses from security breaches in a supply chain. The new efficiency measures of cybersecurity investment are introduced: cybersecurity value and cybersecurity ratio. In addition, the proposed linear model has been enhanced for the Hurwicz-type, best–worst criterion to minimise a convex combination of the minimal and the maximal supply chain node vulnerability, under limited budget. The resulting compromise cybersecurity investment aims at balancing vulnerability over the entire supply chain, independent of cyberattack probabilities and potential losses by security breaches, thereby hardening the weaker critical nodes. The findings indicate a crucial role of intrinsic vulnerability, determined by the architecture of Industry 4.0 supply chain, and highlight ‘design for cybersecurity’ as an important emerging area of research. best–worst criterion. cyber risk management. cybersecurity investment.

A Cyber-Security Culture Framework for Assessing Organization Readiness. This paper presents a cyber-security culture framework for assessing and evaluating the current security readiness of an organization’s workforce. Having conducted a thorough review of the most commonly used security frameworks, we identify core security human-related elements and classify them by constructing a domain agnostic security model. We then proceed by presenting in detail each component of our model and attempt to quantify them in order to achieve a feasible assessment methodology. The paper thereafter presents the application of this methodology for the design and development of a security culture evaluation tool, that offers recommendations and alternative approaches to workforce training programs and techniques. The model has been designed to easily adapt on various application domains while focusing on their unique characteristics. The paper concludes on applications of our instrument on security-critical domains, and its contribution to current research by providing deeper insights regarding the human factor in cybersecurity. assessment. awareness.

Cybersecurity threats and experimental testbed for a generator system. In this work, a high-fidelity virtual testbed modeling a networked diesel generator, similar to those used commercially and by the military, is described. This testbed consists of a physical system model of a generator, a digital control system, a remote monitoring system, and physical and networked connections. The virtual testbed allows researchers to emulate a cyber-physical system and perform cyber attacks against the system without the monetary and safety risks associated with a testbed created from physical components. The testbed was used to feasibly simulate network, hardware Trojan, and software Trojan attacks against the diesel generator, and to observe the cyber and physical outcomes. attacks. cybersecurity. generator system. modeling and simulation. supply chain. vulnerabilities. 
Machine learning in cybersecurity: a comprehensive survey. Today’s world is highly network interconnected owing to the pervasiveness of small personal devices (e.g., smartphones) as well as large computing devices or services (e.g., cloud computing or online banking), and thereby each passing minute millions of data bytes are being generated, processed, exchanged, shared, and utilized to yield outcomes in specific applications. Thus, securing the data, machines (devices), and user’s privacy in cyberspace has become an utmost concern for individuals, business organizations, and national governments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed in cybersecurity, for example, intrusion or malware detection and biometric-based user authentication. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to attacks both in the training and testing phases, which usually leads to remarkable performance decreases and security breaches. Comparatively, limited studies have been conducted to understand the essence and degree of the vulnerabilities of ML techniques against security threats and their defensive mechanisms. It is imperative to systematize recent works related to cybersecurity using ML to seek the attention of researchers, scientists, and engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the works that have been carried out most recently (from 2013 to 2018) on ML in cybersecurity, describing the basics of cyber-attacks and corresponding defenses, the basics of the most commonly used ML algorithms, and proposed ML and data mining schemes for cybersecurity in terms of features, dimensionality reduction, and classification/detection techniques. In this context, this article also provides an overview of adversarial ML, including the security characteristics of deep learning methods. Finally, open issues and challenges in cybersecurity are highlighted and potential future research directions are discussed. adversarial examples. adversarial learning.

Cyber Security Awareness, Knowledge and Behavior: A Comparative Study. Cyber-attacks represent a potential threat to information security. As rates of data usage and internet consumption continue to increase, cyber awareness turned to be increasingly urgent. This study focuses on the relationships between cyber security awareness, knowledge and behavior with protection tools among individuals in general and across four countries: Israel, Slovenia, Poland and Turkey in particular. Results show that internet users possess adequate cyber threat awareness but apply only minimal protective measures usually relatively common and simple ones. The study findings also show that higher cyber knowledge is connected to the level of cyber awareness, beyond the differences in respondent country or gender. In addition, awareness is also connected to protection tools, but not to information they were willing to disclose. Lastly, findings exhibit differences between the explored countries that affect the interaction between awareness, knowledge, and behaviors. Results, implications, and recommendations for effective based cyber security training programs are presented and discussed. cyber awareness. cyber behavior. cyber knowledge.

A differential game view of antagonistic dynamics for cybersecurity. A fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the antagonism between the attacker and the defender can strengthen forward-looking and strategic planning for the cybersecurity. Most of the existing works have one or more of the following limitations: static modeling, non co-evolved strategy and synchronized setting, not accounting for the dynamic nature of the cyber arms race between the defensive and offensive sides. In this paper, we apply differential game theory to analyze the antagonistic dynamics between the attacker and the defender and study two complementary game theoretic formulations, namely the black-box game the and the white-box game: The black-box game can cogently model the opaque-information confrontation and the white-box one is capable to depict the partially transparent-information confrontation. To gain insight into the evolution rule of the antagonistic dynamics between the defensive and the offensive sides, we establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium and the corresponding conditions in the black-box game. Moreover, an iteration algorithm is designed to find the numerical solutions of the Nash equilibrium in the general case and further its analytical solutions in a special case for the white-box game. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed games. Antagonistic dynamics. Cybersecurity. Differential game. Saddle point. 
Cybersecurity Cooperation between Russia and China: Prospects and Problems. The problem of cyberthreats is one of the global issues that can be solved only through cooperation between countries, which is due to the borderless nature of the Internet. Considering that cyberspace is based on non-material assets, which are hard to estimate, the authors put forward an index allowing the evaluation of the financial efficiency of state policy in the field of cybersecurity. The authors propose a differentiated approach to cybersecurity, divide it into three basic levels and offer a broader understanding of cybersecurity. Furthermore, the authors conduct a comparative institutional analysis of the cybersecurity systems in Russia and China. China. cybersecurity. digitalization. Russia.

From public health to cyber hygiene: Cybersecurity and Canada’s healthcare sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a wave of cyberattacks targeting the healthcare sector, including against hospitals, doctors, patients, medical companies, supply chains, universities, research laboratories, and public health organizations at different levels of jurisdiction and across the public and private sectors. Despite these concerns, cybersecurity in Canadian healthcare is significantly understudied. This article uses a series of illustrative examples to highlight the challenges, outcomes, and solutions Canada might consider in addressing healthcare cybersecurity. The article explores the various rationales by which Canadian healthcare may be targeted, unpacks several prominent types of cyberattack used against the healthcare sector, identifies the different malicious actors motivated to conduct such attacks, provides insights derived from three empirical cases of healthcare cyberattack (Boston Children’s Hospital [2014], Anthem [2015], National Health Service [2017]), and concludes with lessons for a Canadian response to healthcare cybersecurity from several international perspectives (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Norway, and the Netherlands).

EU cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy1 [Ciberseguridad y ciberdiplomacia de la UE]. Over the last decades cybersecurity has become a cornerstone of European digital development. Alongside with the diffusion of information and communication technologies and the deepening (as well as widening) of the European Union, the initial narrow and sectoral data security policies have expanded into a comprehensive cybersecurity framework addressing issues from resilient infrastructure and technological sovereignty, through tackling cybercrime, to cyber defence capabilities and responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. In this complex web of interrelated policies a relative newcomer at the European Union (EU) level is cyber diplomacy. Sometimes also called public diplomacy 2.0, it factors into the cross-border connectivity of cyberspace and reflects a shift in international relations where the lines between external and internal policies, military and civilian domains are blurred. However, the term cyber diplomacy is fluid and it is not well understood which topics should be under its umbrella, in particular in relation to cybersecurity, where it seems to be linked the most. This article aims to map existing and proposed instruments that make up the EU’s arsenal in this broad context to answer the following questions: what is cyber diplomacy and how is it related to the EU cybersecurity? Is cyber diplomacy in the EU becoming something in its own right as a distinct set of tools to secure the EU policy objectives? . Cyber diplomacy. Cybersecurity. Diplomacy 2.0. EU cyber policy. 
Evolution and differentiation of the cybersecurity communities in three social question and answer sites: A mixed-methods analysis. Cybersecurity affects us all in our daily lives. New knowledge on best practices, new vulnerabilities, and timely fixes for cybersecurity issues is growing super-linearly, and is spread across numerous, heterogeneous sources. Because of that, community contribution-based, question and answer sites have become clearinghouses for cybersecurity-related inquiries, as they have for many other topics. Historically, Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for different kinds of technical questions, including for cybersecurity. That has been changing, however, with the advent of Security Stack Exchange, a site specifically designed for cybersecurity-related questions and answers. More recently, some cybersecurity-related subreddits of Reddit, have become hubs for cybersecurity-related questions and discussions. The availability of multiple overlapping communities has created a complex terrain to navigate for someone looking for an answer to a cybersecurity question. In this paper, we investigate how and why people choose among three prominent, overlapping, question and answer communities, for their cybersecurity knowledge needs. We aggregated data of several consecutive years of cybersecurity-related questions from Stack Overflow, Security Stack Exchange, and Reddit, and performed statistical, linguistic, and longitudinal analysis. To triangulate the results, we also conducted user surveys. We found that the user behavior across those three communities is different, in most cases. Likewise, cybersecurity-related questions asked on the three sites are different, more technical on Security Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow, and more subjective and personal on Reddit. Moreover, there appears to have been a differentiation of the communities along the same lines, accompanied by overall popularity trends suggestive of Stack Overflow’s decline and Security Stack Exchange’s rise within the cybersecurity community. Reddit is addressing the more subjective, discussion type needs of the lay community, and is growing rapidly. 
Optimal Cybersecurity Investments in Large Networks Using SIS Model: Algorithm Design. We study the problem of minimizing the (time) average security costs in large networks/systems comprising many interdependent subsystems, where the state evolution is captured by a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. The security costs reflect security investments, economic losses and recovery costs from infections and failures following successful attacks. We show that the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex and propose a suite of algorithms-two based on convex relaxations, and the other two for finding a local minimizer, based on a reduced gradient method and sequential convex programming. Also, we provide a sufficient condition under which the convex relaxations are exact and, hence, an optimal solution of the original problem can be recovered. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Cybersecurity investments. optimization. SIS model. 
IT/OT convergence and cyber security. A study by Forrester, commissioned by Fortinet, reveals the growing exposure of industry players to cyberthreats – one of the consequences of digital transformation.1 The lack of collaboration between IT teams and those in charge of industrial or operational technology (OT) is also a hindrance to cyber security for companies wishing to take full advantage of IT/OT convergence to increase their competitiveness. 
Applying infinite petri nets to the cybersecurity of intelligent networks, grids and clouds. Correctness of networking protocols represents the principal requirement of cybersecurity. Correctness of protocols is established via the procedures of their verification. A classical communication system includes a pair of interacting systems. Recent developments of computing and communication grids for radio broadcasting, cellular networks, communication subsystems of super-computers, specialized grids for numerical methods and networks on chips require verification of protocols for any number of devices. For analysis of computing and communication grid structures, a new class of infinite Petri nets has been introduced and studied for more than 10 years. Infinite Petri nets were also applied for simulating cellular automata. Rectangular, triangular and hexagonal grids on plane, hyper cube and hyper torus in multidimensional space have been considered. Composing and solving in parametric form infinite Diophantine systems of linear equations allowed us to prove the protocol properties for any grid size and any number of dimensions. Software generators of infinite Petri net models have been developed. Special classes of graphs, such as a graph of packet transmission directions and a graph of blockings, have been introduced and studied. Complex deadlocks have been revealed and classified. In the present paper, infinite Petri nets are divided into two following kinds: a single infinite construct and an infinite set of constructs of specified size (and number of dimensions). Finally, the paper discusses possible future work directions. Computing cloud. Computing grid. Cybersecurity. Infinite Petri net. Verification of protocols. 
Organization benefit as an outcome of organizational security adoption: The role of cyber security readiness and technology readiness. The increasing number of cyber-attacks has become a serious threat to organizations, organizations that are not prepared to face cyber-attacks on their organizational resources will experience huge losses and reduce organizational performance. It is a big challenge for organizations to combat cyber-attacks by improving cyber security, but there is still little research examining the factors that affect an organization’s cyber security readiness from a holistic point of view. This study integrates a framework based on technology, organization, environment, and technology readiness to examine various factors that affect cyber security readiness in organizations, as well as their impact on organizational performance, where the impact is in the form of tangible and intangible benefits. This study proposes 4 hypotheses to test the framework that has been built. A total of 260 data have been validated from an online questionnaire survey given to organizations and companies. This study applied quantitative approach, while the main method used was SEM-PLS and the software involved was SmartPLS V2. The results of the study indicate that the overall hypotheses proposed have a significant impact, cyber security readiness and technology have a positive impact on organizational security performance, which in turn has an impact on the intangible benefits and tangible benefits. The results of this study can be used by organizations as a guide in improving cyber security to achieve superior performance in organizations and improve understanding of references related to cyber security in organizations. Meanwhile, this research has impact to the society because the good cooperation and good organization will be achieved. it also increases the social cooperation responsibility.

Systematically understanding cybersecurity economics: A survey. Insights in the field of cybersecurity economics empower decision makers to make informed decisions that improve their evaluation and management of situations that may lead to catastrophic consequences and threaten the sustainability of digital ecosystems. By drawing on these insights, cybersecurity practitioners have been able to respond to many complex problems that have emerged within the context of cybersecurity over the last two decades. The academic field of cybersecurity economics is highly interdisciplinary since it combines core findings and tools from disciplines such as sociology, psychology, law, political science, and computer science. This study aims to develop an extensive and consistent survey based on a literature review and publicly available reports. This review contributes by aggregating the available knowledge from 28 studies, out of a collection of 628 scholarly articles, to answer five specific research questions. The focus is how identified topics have been conceptualized and studied variously. This review shows that most of the cybersecurity economics models are transitioning from unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified fundamental premises toward dynamic, stochastic, and generalizable models.

A proposal of ethical competence model for cyber security organization. A proactive cyber security plan to safeguard confidential information and privacy still lacks initiatives to avoid frequent harmful attacks. Cybersecurity professionals must possess ethical competence and prove worthy of overseeing valuable information for efficient decision-making since ethical competence is fundamental for daily practice. There is a need to define what it means to be ethically competent in the era of IR4.0. The previous competence models still lack consideration of both artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence (EI) skills. AI brings new opportunities to cyber security organizations that focus on AI skills related to cognitive Intelligence or intelligent quotient (IQ). EI, which refers to emotional quotient (EQ), is a good predictor of ethical competence as it can perceive and express emotions precisely to facilitate thought to understand and manage emotions. However, practically, most cyber security organizations focused on AI skills and disregarded EI skills' roles. This research proposes a cyber artemotional model that blends AI skills and EI skills for cyber security employees. This research would benefit cyber security organizations with cyber artemotional model as employees ethical competence assessment, and it is in line with the demand of IR4.0. Artificial intelligence.

Application perspective on cybersecurity testbed for industrial control systems. In recent years, the Industry 4.0 paradigm has accelerated the digitalization process of the industry, and it slowly diminishes the line between information technologies (IT) and operational technologies (OT). Among the advantages, this brings up the convergence issue between IT and OT, especially in the cybersecurity-related topics, including new attack vectors, threats, security imperfections, and much more. This cause raised new topics for methods focused on protecting the industrial infrastructure, including monitoring and detection systems, which should help overcome these new challenges. However, those methods require high quality and a large number of datasets with different conditions to adapt to the specific systems effectively. Unfortunately, revealing field factory setups and infrastructure would be costly and challenging due to the privacy and sensitivity causes. From the lack of data emerges the new topic of industrial testbeds, including sub-real physical laboratory environments, virtual factories, honeynets, honeypots, and other areas, which helps to deliver sufficient datasets for mentioned research and development. This paper summarizes related works in the area of industrial testbeds. Moreover, it describes best practices and lessons learned for assembling physical, simulated, virtual, and hybrid testbeds. Additionally, a comparison of the essential parameters of those testbeds is presented. Finally, the findings and provided information reveal research and development challenges, which must be surpassed. Cybersecurity. HMI. ICS. Industrial control system. OT. PLC. SCADA. Testbed.

Increasing teacher competence in cybersecurity using the eu security frameworks. A study was undertaken to identify the missing skill and expertise of teachers and other stakeholders in the field of EU cyber security regulatory documents and frameworks. In order to increase the knowledge in this area and promote the EU security frameworks the model for the continuous building of teacher competence has been proposed and planned to be implemented in Ukraine. The proposed model will contribute towards improving the excellence of educators and academics, as well as increase competitiveness of educational programmes on cybersecurity among similar institutions in the EU countries. Various studies focused on the development of competence of the students to prepare them for the job market and build a comprehensive portfolio, education-business partnerships and collaboration. However, the issue of developing teacher expertise to achieve high quality of education remains open. We highlighted the importance of creating a cybersecurity ecosystem through the cooperation with different stakeholders and by implementing the model for continuous development of teacher competence. Before building the model the overview and analysis of different teacher professional development approaches were conducted. Analysis showed that for our goal the best suitable approach is a model that consists of two stages based on self-education and group education approaches with 7 processes inside. The study revealed that competence may be achieved through a number of activities which may be grouped under four generic categories: student and staff training, academic and business seminars, business-oriented roundtable debates, and research. The model uses as main methods of achieving a better quality of education in cybersecurity the development of new training courses and modernization of educational programs, and for raising awareness among businesses and regulatory bodies-the workshops and roundtables.

An integrated cybernetic awareness strategy to assess cybersecurity attitudes and behaviours in school context. Digital exposure to the Internet among the younger generations, notwithstanding their digital abilities, has increased and raised the alarm regarding the need to intensify the education on cybersecurity in schools. Understanding of the human factor and its influence on children, namely their attitudes and behaviors online, is pivotal to reinforce their awareness towards cyberattacks, and to promote their digital citizenship. This paper aims to present an integrated cybersecurity and cyberawareness strategy composed of three major steps: (1) Cybersecurity attitude and behavior assessment, (2) self-diagnosis, and (3) teaching/learning activities. The following contributions are made: Two questionnaires to assess risky attitudes and behaviors regarding cybersecurity. a self-diagnosis to measure students’ skills on cybersecurity. a lesson plan addressing cyberawareness to be applied on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and citizenship education curricular units. Cybersecurity risky attitudes and behaviors were evaluated in a junior high school population of 164 students attending the sixth and ninth grades. The assessment focused on two main subjects: To identify the attitudes and behaviors that raise the risk on cybersecurity among the participating students. to characterize the acquired students’ cybersecurity and cyberawareness skills. Global and individual scores and the histograms for attitudes and behaviors are presented. The items in which we have observed significant differences between sixth and ninth grades are depicted and quantified by their corresponding p-values obtained through the Mann–Whitney non-parametric test. Regarding the results obtained on the assessment of attitudes and behaviors, although positive, we observed that the attitudes and behaviors in ninth grade students are globally inferior compared to those attained by sixth grade students. The deployed strategy for cyberawareness was applied in a school context. however, the same approach is suitable to be applied in other types of organizations, namely enterprises, healthcare institutions and public sector.

Maritime cyber security: A global challenge tackled through distinct regional approaches. Maritime cyber security is an emerging issue that requires immediate attention, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Feedback received from global shipping professionals indicate that a common threat to the industry, such as cyber security, is dealt with differently among industry practitioners around the globe. Data collected from two targeted focus groups (one in Europe and the second in Asia, two leading groups in the maritime transport sector) demonstrated that, based on technology adoption maturity, cyber security is perceived differently between these groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these differences. Our findings lead to useful intelligence that will inform key maritime decision makers, both in meeting the IMO requirements and preparing the organization to address cyber risks.

Legal aspects of cybersecurity in the energy sector—current state and latest proposals of legislative changes by the eu. Due to the strategic nature of the energy sector, legal solutions to protect cross-border electricity and gas connections will be of particular importance. The author realizes that at the present stage of development, the cross-border impact may also be manifested by generating units (e.g., wind farms) or even end users themselves. The lack of harmonized regulations in this area may not only lead to limitations in the physical supply of electricity and gas, but also affect future investment decisions regarding, for example, new generation capacities. In a broader aspect, it will delay, and in the extreme case prevent, the achievement of the objectives resulting from the EU energy policy, in particular integration within the single energy market. In this article, the author identifies devices and entities responsible for energy infrastructure that should be classified as necessary for the functioning of the single energy market. The research includes the analysis and evaluation of regulations governing cybersecurity in the energy sector, taking into account the interdependencies within, intersectoral and cross-border. In addition, the author refers to the need to introduce individual legal solutions regarding the protection of energy infrastructure. Critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity. Energy sector.

Intelligent cyber-security system for iot-aided drones using voting classifier. Developments in drones have opened new trends and opportunities in different fields, particularly in small drones. Drones provide interlocation services for navigation, and this interlink is provided by the Internet of Things (IoT). However, architectural issues make drone networks vulnerable to privacy and security threats. It is critical to provide a safe and secure network to acquire desired performance. Small drones are finding new paths for progress in the civil and defense industries, but also posing new challenges for security and privacy as well. The basic design of the small drone requires a modification in its data transformation and data privacy mechanisms, and it is not yet fulfilling domain requirements. This paper aims to investigate recent privacy and security trends that are affecting the Internet of Drones (IoD). This study also highlights the need for a safe and secure drone network that is free from interceptions and intrusions. The proposed framework mitigates the cyber security threats by employing intelligent machine learning models in the design of IoT-aided drones by making them secure and adaptable. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and shows robust results. Cyber-security. Drones. IoT. Machine learning. 
Validity and reliability of Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire for middle and high school students: A validation study with Rasch analysis. In cybersecurity practice, two methodological challenges exist, that is, how to improve validity and reliability of cybersecurity assessment as a weak hypothesis and how to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks among the K-12 school population as the weakest link. To address these two challenges, the present study aimed to verify the validity and reliability of one newly developed questionnaire, Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire for Middle and High School Students, using the Rasch modeling. A total of 398 middle and high school students from the GenCyber Camps participated in this study. The results of the Rasch model analysis show that (1) the Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire was unidimensional, measuring one single construct of cybersecurity judgment. (2) the questionnaire had acceptable item construct validity and person construct validity. (3) the item reliability and person reliability of the questionnaire were also acceptable, and (4) a few items might need revisions to increase item difficulty and reduce redundancy, if this would be confirmed by more replication studies with more representative samples. Suggestions for improvement and administration of the questions are discussed. 
Standardization of the Distributed Ledger Technology cybersecurity stack for power and energy applications. The global trend toward integration of distributed energy resources is opening doors to advanced, complex, and distributed marketplaces. Such advanced ecosystems, where utility-owned and non utility-owned assets can contribute toward grid operations, generally require distributed communication and grid architectures. We posit the potential of using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) in supporting such applications, although their full potential has not been fully used, for example in designing long-term scalable solutions in operational technology applications. This is partly due to the lack of standardization across and between different DLTs, as well as other supporting building blocks (e.g., communication protocols). This paper attempts to address this gap by proposing a DLT cybersecurity stack specifically designed for researchers, DLT technology developers, and end users (such as utilities). The DLT cybersecurity stack has been notionally mapped to related cybersecurity components, namely the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite, and existing Smart Grid architecture frameworks. In addition, the paper discusses several cybersecurity implications, and demonstrates the potential uses of the DLT cybersecurity stack through multiple power and energy use cases. It is important to note that the stack can be also applied to the DLT use cases that are outside the power and energy domain. This work was performed by the Cybersecurity Task Force under the IEEE P2418.5 Blockchain for Energy Standard working group that part of the IEEE Power and Energy Society's Smart Buildings, Loads, and Customer Systems (SBLC) technical committee.

Cybersecurity knowledge and skills for port facility security officers of international seaports: Perspectives of IT and security personnel. Cyberattacks on worldwide port facilities have highlighted the urgent need for port facility security officers (PFSOs) to upgrade their cybersecurity knowledge and skills. This study used the survey data from all international container ports in Thailand and analyzed the results from two perspectives, i.e., IT and security officers. Based on 73 responses, cybersecurity knowledge and skill would become essential for PFSOs than ever before because the port digitalization and automation would shape the PFSOs career to a technically-oriented specialist rather than a multi-skilled generalist. Furthermore, the responsibilities of PFSOs would extend to cover cyber risk management, which enables them to prevent the digital port facilities from emerging cyber threats. Therefore, they should learn how to incorporate the existing risk management process with cyber risk management and cybersecurity knowledge because these would be the foundation for PFSOs to practice cybersecurity skills. At the end of the learning process, PFSOs could also gain cybersecurity competence once they have mature knowledge and skill, which would be the vital element of port security hygiene.

How do Older Adults feel about engaging with Cyber-Security?. Older adults are increasingly a target for cyber-attacks. however, very little research has investigated how they feel about engaging in protective cyber-security behaviors. We developed and applied a novel card-sorting task to elicit how older adults feel about protective cyber-security behaviors and to identify the factors that impact their confidence in executing these behaviors. Nineteen task-assisted interviews were conducted with UK older adults. A thematic analysis revealed that older adults see protective online behaviors as important, but their reasons for disengagement fell into three categories: I do not want to (essentially, because the costs outweigh the benefits), I do not need to (e.g. because it is not my responsibility), and I am unable to (which includes heightened anxiety about doing something wrong). Underlying confidence around engagement with protective behaviors was a function of three factors: personal competence (related to good computer self-efficacy and relevant past experience), support (having a good network for information and advice), and demand (the effort of keeping up to date with the latest advice). Ultimately, we found that older adults are keen to protect themselves but are lacking appropriate support and we discuss implications for developers, researchers, and policy makers. This paper explores older adults' perceptions of common cyber-security behaviors. We introduce an effective card sorting methodology for security elicitation in older adults. We apply this to identify reasons as to why older adults may not engage in security behaviors as well as identifying a number of reasons why older adults actively avoid engaging in security behaviors. 
Operational Technology on Construction Sites: A Review from the Cybersecurity Perspective. The digital transformation in the construction industry affects how information is exchanged and disrupts the way construction sites operate. The levels of operational technology (OT) to control and monitor site activities by utilizing robotic, autonomous, and remotely controlled machines raise cybersecurity concerns. As construction sites are places where humans and machines work together, the potential safety outcomes of cybersecurity vulnerabilities are magnified. This study's motivation was to understand the current state of the art and identify gaps to suggest future directions regarding OT in construction from the cybersecurity perspective. To achieve that, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. The analysis utilized the Scopus database to retrieve related publications and VOSviewer version 1.6.15 software to visualize bibliometric networks. Main research themes were identified, and each theme was reviewed from a cybersecurity perspective. The limitations of the analysis include the lack of industry-based categorization, the domination of publications focusing on the cybersecurity of industrial control systems (ICSs), and the set of keyword combinations used for the literature search that could be expanded to cover a broader range of research topics. The findings reveal the lack of focus on the construction phase in the construction cybersecurity research. Moreover, cybersecurity aspects are absent in the construction automation studies, and there is a need for bespoke threat modeling and intrusion detection systems for all the phases of construction projects. Suggestions for further research on the potential threats against the construction phase are provided. Future directions include possible adaptations of the available cybersecurity frameworks considering the utilization of OT on construction sites and investigating the methods to evaluate security levels on construction sites and countermeasures against cyberattacks.

Exploring cybersecurity issues in 5G enabled electric vehicle charging station with deep learning. The surging usage of electric vehicles (EVs) demand the robust deployment of trustworthy electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) with millisecond range latency and massive machine to machine communications where 5G could act. However, 5G suffers from inherent protocols, hardware, and software vulnerabilities that seriously threaten the communicating entities' cyber-physical security. To overcome these limitations in the EVCS system, this paper analyses the impact of False Data Injection (FDI) and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks on the operation of EVCS. This work is an extension of the previously published conference paper about the EVCS. As new features, this paper simulates the FDI attack and the syn flood DDoS attacks on 5G enabled remote Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that controls the solar photovoltaics (PV) controller, Battery Energy Storage (BES) controller, and EV controller of the EVCS. The extent of delay has been increased to more than 500 ms with the severe DDoS attack via 5G. The attacks make the EVCS system oscillate or shift the DC operating point. The frequency of oscillation, its damping, and the system's resiliency are found to be related to the attacks' intensity and the target controller. Finally, the novel stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are proposed solely based on the electrical fingerprint. This model can detect the stealthy cyberattacks that bypass the cyber layer and go unnoticed in the monitoring system with nearly 100% detection accuracy. 
Social engineering in cybersecurity: a domain ontology and knowledge graph application examples. Social engineering has posed a serious threat to cyberspace security. To protect against social engineering attacks, a fundamental work is to know what constitutes social engineering. This paper first develops a domain ontology of social engineering in cybersecurity and conducts ontology evaluation by its knowledge graph application. The domain ontology defines 11 concepts of core entities that significantly constitute or affect social engineering domain, together with 22 kinds of relations describing how these entities related to each other. It provides a formal and explicit knowledge schema to understand, analyze, reuse and share domain knowledge of social engineering. Furthermore, this paper builds a knowledge graph based on 15 social engineering attack incidents and scenarios. 7 knowledge graph application examples (in 6 analysis patterns) demonstrate that the ontology together with knowledge graph is useful to 1) understand and analyze social engineering attack scenario and incident, 2) find the top ranked social engineering threat elements (e.g. the most exploited human vulnerabilities and most used attack mediums), 3) find potential social engineering threats to victims, 4) find potential targets for social engineering attackers, 5) find potential attack paths from specific attacker to specific target, and 6) analyze the same origin attacks.

A novel SETA-based gamification framework to raise cybersecurity awareness. Information is a critical asset in any organization to achieve its strategic goals. For this, organizations enforce physical, logical, and administrative controls to protect their information from being corrupted, manipulated, or breached. However, an employee with little awareness of cybersecurity threats is an easy target for attackers. Nowadays, companies implement security awareness using policies, procedures, and training sessions, to list a few. Traditional information security awareness sessions have relied heavily on presentation slides and videos. This paper aims to improve the employees’ cybersecurity awareness by developing an interactive video game, a cyber shield game, that includes various embedded threat scenarios. The proposed game consists of four levels. The password complexity level educates players about password threats. The social engineering level aware employees about email attachments and trespass threats. The phishing attack level educates employees about phishing emails and ransomware threats. Finally, the physical security level aware employees about threats to storage and work documents’ disposal. Further, two surveys, pre-game and post-game, are conducted to estimate the players’ knowledge and experience in cybersecurity threats. The proposed security awareness program is applied to ten employees randomly chosen from different organizations. Experimental results indicate that the cyber shield training and awareness program is more interactive than traditional awareness methods. Results also suggest that the proposed awareness program improves the employees’ cybersecurity awareness level by 51.4%. Cybersecurity. Interactive video game. Phishing. Social engineering.

Cybersecurity challenges in energy sector (virtual power plants) - can edge computing principles be applied to enhance security?. Distributed generators (D.G.’s) enable us to generate, supply and be self-reliant on power while also allows us to supply power to meet the demand through virtual power plants. The virtual power plants also help us analyse, control, optimise, and help bridge the gap of demand and supply in these vast energy requirements. With this also comes challenges associated with securing physical systems, data protection and information privacy. Recent technological advancements have aided cybercriminals to disrupt operations by carrying out deliberate attacks on the energy sector. Though security researchers have tried to mitigate the risks, vulnerabilities, and it remains a challenge. This paper aims to present a comprehensive Edge-based security architecture to help reduce the risks and help secure the physical systems and ensure privacy and data protection.

Data and knowledge-driven named entity recognition for cyber security. Named Entity Recognition (NER) for cyber security aims to identify and classify cyber security terms from a large number of heterogeneous multisource cyber security texts. In the field of machine learning, deep neural networks automatically learn text features from a large number of datasets, but this data-driven method usually lacks the ability to deal with rare entities. Gasmi et al. proposed a deep learning method for named entity recognition in the field of cyber security, and achieved good results, reaching an F1 value of 82.8%. But it is difficult to accurately identify rare entities and complex words in the text.To cope with this challenge, this paper proposes a new model that combines data-driven deep learning methods with knowledge-driven dictionary methods to build dictionary features to assist in rare entity recognition. In addition, based on the data-driven deep learning model, an attention mechanism is adopted to enrich the local features of the text, better models the context, and improves the recognition effect of complex entities. Experimental results show that our method is better than the baseline model. Our model is more effective in identifying cyber security entities. The Precision, Recall and F1 value reached 90.19%, 86.60% and 88.36% respectively. Attention mechanism. Cyber security. Deep learning. Dictionary. Named entity recognition.

A new enhanced cyber security framework for medical cyber physical systems. Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) are complex, location-aware, networked systems of medical devices that can be used as a piece of the healing center to give the best medical care to patients. Hence, they integrate human, cyber, and physical elements. Since MCPSs are life-critical and context-aware, they are significant to the healthcare industry, which is prone to data breaches and cyber-attacks. As an emerging research area, MCPS faces several challenges with respect to system reliability, assurance, autonomy and security, and privacy. In this paper, we initially examine the state-of-the-arts of MCPS over the last few decades (1998–2020) and subsequently propose a new framework considering security/privacy for MPCS that incorporates several models that depict various domains of security. An interaction between various models followed with a qualitative assessment of the framework has been carried out to present a detailed description of the proposed framework. It is useful in various healthcare industries like health care services, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, etc. that utilize smart devices. Additionally, the framework may be applied to enhance security in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. It may be also useful to deploy efficient workflow operations for patients under the consideration framework. The framework will also lay out the foundation for implementing cybersecurity infrastructures in many healthcare applications. Cyber security. Medical control systems. Medical cyber-physical systems.

Exploring cybersecurity-related emotions and finding that they are challenging to measure. This paper reports on a three-part investigation into people’s perceptions of cybersecurity, based on their lived experiences. We sought thereby to reveal issues located within the Johari grid’s Blind Spot quadrant. We utilized research methodologies from both the Arts and Science in order firstly to identify blind spot issues, and secondly to explore their dimensions. Our investigation confirmed a number of aspects that we were indeed aware of, when it came to people’s lived cybersecurity experiences. We also identified one particular blind spot issue: widespread, but not universal, negativity towards cybersecurity. We then carried out an investigation using a recognized methodology from psychology, as a first attempt to assess the nature of this negativity and to get a sense of its roots. What our initial experiment revealed was that scoping cybersecurity-related emotions is nontrivial and will require the formulation of new measurement tools. We conclude by reporting on the challenges, to inform researchers who plan to extend the research reported in this paper. 
Detecting cybersecurity attacks across different network features and learners. Machine learning algorithms efficiently trained on intrusion detection datasets can detect network traffic capable of jeopardizing an information system. In this study, we use the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset to investigate ensemble feature selection on the performance of seven classifiers. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 is big data (about 16,000,000 instances), publicly available, modern, and covers a wide range of realistic attack types. Our contribution is centered around answers to three research questions. The first question is, Does feature selection impact performance of classifiers in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and F1-score? The second question is, Does including the Destination_Port categorical feature significantly impact performance of LightGBM and Catboost in terms of AUC and F1-score? The third question is, Does the choice of classifier: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Catboost, LightGBM, or XGBoost, significantly impact performance in terms of AUC and F1-score? These research questions are all answered in the affirmative and provide valuable, practical information for the development of an efficient intrusion detection model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use an ensemble feature selection technique with the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. Big data. Catboost. CSE-CIC-IDS2018. Feature selection.

What's in a Name? Metaphors and Cybersecurity. For more than a decade, the United States military has conceptualized and discussed the Internet and related systems as cyberspace, understood as a domain of conflict like land, sea, air, and outer space. How and why did this concept become entrenched in US doctrine? What are its effects? Focusing on the emergence and consolidation of this terminology, I make three arguments about the role of language in cybersecurity policy. First, I propose a new, politically consequential category of metaphor: foundational metaphors, implied by using particular labels rather than stated outright. These metaphors support specific ways to understand complex issues, provide discursive resources to some arguments over others, and shape policy contestation and outcomes. Second, I present a detailed empirical study of US military strategy and doctrine that traces the emergence and consolidation of terminology built on the cyberspace domain. This concept supported implicit metaphorical correspondences between the Internet and physical space, yielding specific analogies and arguments for understanding the Internet and its effects. Third, I focus on the rhetorical effects of this terminology to reveal two important institutional consequences: this language has been essential to expanding the military's role in cybersecurity, and specific interests within the Department of Defense have used this framework to support the creation of US Cyber Command. These linguistic effects in the United States also have implications for how other states approach cybersecurity, for how international law is applied to cyber operations, and for how International Relations understands language and technological change.

Cybersecurity Protection for PACS and Medical Imaging: Deployment Considerations and Practical Problems. Cybersecurity is increasingly affecting the healthcare sector. In a recent article, the authors analyzed specific attacks against picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) and medical imaging networks and proposed security measures. This article discusses issues that require consideration when deploying these proposed measures and provides recommendations on how to implement them. Hospitals should deploy virus scanners on systems where permitted, with high priority on devices that are part of the central IT infrastructure of the hospital. They should introduce a systematic management of software updates on operating system, application software and virus scanner level and clarify the provision of security updates for the intended duration of use when purchasing a new device. They should agree with the PACS vendor on a long-term strategy for implementing access rights, and enable encrypted network communication where possible. This requires an agreement on the encryption algorithms to be used, and a public-key infrastructure. For most of these tasks, standards and profiles exist today. There are, however, some gaps: Implementation of cybersecurity measures would be facilitated by integration profiles on certificate and signature management, and access rights in a PACS environment.

Methodological Framework for the Development of an English-Lithuanian Cybersecurity Termbase [Anglų-lietuvių kalbų kibernetinio saugumo terminų bazės kūrimo metodikos modelis]. The aim of the paper is to present a methodological framework for the development of an Abstract English-Lithuanian bilingual termbase in the cybersecurity domain, which can be applied as a model for other language pairs and other specialised domains. It is argued that the presented methodological approach can ensure creation of high-quality bilingual termbases even with limited available resources. The paper touches upon the methods and problems of dataset (corpora) compilation, terminology annotation, automatic bilingual term extraction (BiTE) and alignment, knowledge-rich context extraction, and linguistic linked open data (LLOD) technologies. The paper presents theoretical considerations as well as the arguments on the effectiveness of the described methods. The theoretical analysis and a pilot study allow arguing that: 1) a combination of parallel and comparable corpora enable to considerably expand the amount and variety of data sources that can be used for terminology extraction. this methodology is especially important for less-resourced languages which often lack parallel data. 2) deep learning systems trained by using gold standard corpora (manually annotated data) allow effective automatization of extraction of terminological data and metadata, which enables to regularly update termbases with minimised manual input. 3) LLOD technologies enable to integrate the terminological data into the global linguistic data ecosystem and make it reusable, searchable and discoverable across the Web.

Modelling Cyberspace to Determine Cybersecurity Training Requirements. Cyberspace is a constantly evolving and expanding environment that is being used for an ever-increasing range of purposes. As such, it attracts numerous threat actors seeking to identify and exploit its vulnerabilities. In order to be able to fully mitigate the risk of compromise, it is necessary to first understand the nature and composition of cyberspace and how it is used. This chapter seeks to address this issue by presenting a method to model cyberspace in three dimensions with humans included as an integral part. Expanding beyond describing cyberspace purely in terms of technology and its uses, it explores geographic, political, and temporal aspects to reflect its dynamic nature. The first component of the model examines the varied attributes of cyberspace ranging from the landscape in which its components are located to how they are used. The second dimension investigates the path of data in all its forms from its source to destination, emphasising that cyberspace is fundamentally a communications medium and is not borderless. Thirdly, it focuses on the security dimension and the motivations of those with malicious intent, demonstrating the multidisciplinary and essentially human nature of cybersecurity in countering their activities.

Introducing the concept of cybersecurity footprint. Purpose: This paper aims to introduce the concept of cybersecurity footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Characteristics of cybersecurity footprint are presented based on documented cases, and the domino effect of cybersecurity is illustrated. Organizational and individual cybersecurity footprints are outlined. Active and passive – digital vs cybersecurity footprints are then reviewed. Taxonomy of aware/unaware vs active/passive cybersecurity footprints are presented, followed by brief discussion of the implications for future research. Findings: The concept of cybersecurity footprint is defined, and the evidence from prior cyber incidents is shown to emphasize the concept. Smaller organizations may have a large cybersecurity footprint, whereas larger organizations may have smaller one. Cyberattacks are focusing on the individuals or small organizations that are in the supply chain of larger organizations causing the domino effect. Practical implications: Implications of cybersecurity footprint to individuals, organizations, societies and governments are discussed. The authors present organizations with ways to lower cybersecurity footprint along with recommendations for future research. Social implications: Cybersecurity has a significant social implication worldwide, as the world is becoming cyber dependent. With the authors’ introduction of the cybersecurity footprint concept and call to further understand how organizations can measure and reduce it, the authors envision it as another perspective of assessing cyber risk and further help mitigate future cyber incidents. Originality/value: This paper extends the existing information and computer security body of knowledge on the concept of cybersecurity footprint with illustrated cases.

A feature-based approach for guiding the selection of Internet of Things cybersecurity standards using text mining. Cybersecurity is critical in realizing Internet of Things (IoT) applications and many different standards have been introduced specifically for this purpose. However, selecting relevant standards is not trivial and requires a broad understanding of cybersecurity and knowledge about the available standards. In this study, we present a systematic approach that guides IoT system developers in selecting relevant cybersecurity standards for their IoT projects. The systematic approach has been developed in four stages. First, the common and variant features of IoT cybersecurity have been modeled using a feature model. Second, an up-to-date overview of the IoT cybersecurity standards landscape has been mapped by combining existing overviews. Third, a text mining algorithm has been implemented. Fourth, the systematic approach has been modeled using business process modeling notation. Our case study demonstrated that this approach is effective and efficient for guiding the selection of IoT cybersecurity standards. cybersecurity. feature model.

Assessment of the cybersecurity vulnerability of construction networks. Purpose: The aim of this study is o examine the advantages and disadvantages of different existing scoring systems in the cybersecurity domain and their applicability to the AEC industry and to systematically apply a scoring system to determine scores for some of the most significant construction participants. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a methodology that uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to calculate scores and the likelihood of occurrence based on communication frequencies to ultimately determine risk categories for different paths in a construction network. As a proof of concept, the proposed methodology is implemented in a construction network from a real project found in the literature. Findings: Results show that the proposed methodology could provide valuable information to assist project participants to assess the overall cybersecurity vulnerability of construction and assist during the vulnerability-management processes. For example, a project owner can use this information to get a better understanding of what to do to limit its vulnerability, which will lead to the overall improvement of the security of the construction network. Research limitations/implications: It has to be noted that the scoring systems, the scores and categories adopted in the study need not necessarily be an exact representation of all the construction participants or networks. Therefore, caution should be exercised to avoid generalizing the results of this study. Practical implications: The proposed methodology can provide valuable information and assist project participants to assess the overall cyber-vulnerability of construction projects and support the vulnerability-management processes. For example, a project owner can use this approach to get a better understanding of what to do to limit its cyber-vulnerability exposure, which will ultimately lead to the overall improvement of the construction network's security. This study will also help raise more awareness about the cybersecurity implications of the digitalization and automation of the AEC industry among practitioners and construction researchers. Social implications: Given the amount of digitized services and tools used in the AEC industry, cybersecurity is increasingly becoming critical for society in general. In some cases, (e.g. critical infrastructure) incidents could have significant economic and societal or public safety implications. Therefore, proper consideration and action from the AEC research community and industry are needed. Originality/value: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure and assess the cybersecurity of individual participants and the construction network as a whole by using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System.

Analyzing the impact of cyber security related attributes for intrusion detection systems. Machine learning (ML) is one of the dominating technologies practiced in both the in-dustrial and academic domains throughout the world. ML algorithms can examine the threats and respond to intrusions and security incidents swiftly in an instinctive way. It plays a critical function in providing a proactive security mechanism in the cybersecurity domain. Cybersecurity ensures the real time protection of information, information systems, and networks from intruders. Several security and privacy reports have cited that there has been a rapid increase in both the frequency and the number of cybersecurity breaches in the last decade. Information security has been compromised by intruders at an alarming rate. Anomaly detection, phishing page identification, software vulnerability diagnosis, malware identification, and denial of services attacks are the main cyber-security issues that demand effective solutions. Researchers and experts have been practicing different approaches to address the current cybersecurity issues and challenges. However, in this research endeavor, our objective is to make an idealness assessment of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) under the hesitant fuzzy (HF) conditions, using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal-solutions (TOPSIS). Hesitant fuzzy sets are useful for addressing decision-making situations in which experts must overcome the reluctance to make a conclusion. The proposed research project would assist the machine learning practitioners and cybersecurity specialists in identifying, selecting, and prioritizing cybersecurity-related attributes for intrusion detection systems, and build more ideal and effective intrusion detection systems.

Emerging Cybersecurity Threats in Radiation Oncology. Purpose: Modern image guided radiation therapy is dependent on information technology and data storage applications that, like any other digital technology, are at risk from cyberattacks. Owing to a recent escalation in cyberattacks affecting radiation therapy treatments, the American Society for Radiation Oncology's Advances in Radiation Oncology is inaugurating a new special manuscript category devoted to cybersecurity issues. Methods and Materials: We conducted a review of emerging cybersecurity threats and a literature review of cyberattacks that affected radiation oncology practices. Results: In the last 10 years, numerous attacks have led to an interruption of radiation therapy for thousands of patients, and some of these catastrophic incidents have been described as being worse than the coronavirus disease of 2019 impact on centers in New Zealand. Conclusions: Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, making combatting these attacks more difficult for health care organizations and requiring a change in strategies, tactics, and culture around cyber security in health and radiation oncology. We recommend an assume breach mentality (threat-informed defense posture) and adopting a cloud-first and zero-trust security strategy. A reliance on computer-driven technology makes radiation oncology practices more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Health care providers should increase their resilience and cyber security maturity. The increase in the diversity of these attacks demands improved preparedness and collaboration between oncologic treatment centers both nationwide and internationally to protect patients. 
Selecting a Passive Network Monitoring Solution for Medical Device Cybersecurity Management. The number of cyberattacks and information system breaches in healthcare have grown exponentially, as well as escalated from accidental incidents to targeted and malicious attacks. With medical devices representing a substantial repository of all the assets in a healthcare system, network security and monitoring are critical to ensuring cyber hygiene of these medical devices. Because of the unique challenges of connected medical devices, a passive network monitoring (PNM) solution is preferred for its overall cybersecurity management. This article is intended to provide guidance on selecting PNM solutions while reinforcing the importance of program assessment, project management, and use of leading practices that facilitate the selection and further implementation of PNM solutions for medical devices. The article provides a detailed introduction to connected medical devices and its role in effective care delivery, an overview of network security types and PNM, an overview of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and its application for program assessment, essentials of project management for PNM solution selection and implementation, key performance indicators for measuring a solution's ability to meet critical cybersecurity needs for medical devices, and lessons learned from the author's professional experience, selective literature review, and leading practices. Rather than describing a complete list of guidelines for selecting PNM solutions, the current work is intended to provide guidance based on the author's experience and leading practices compiled from successful medical device cybersecurity programs.

Model for successful development and implementation of Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC). Cyberattacks have changed dramatically and have become highly advanced. This latest phenomenon has a massive negative impact on organizations, such as financial losses and shutting-down of operations. Therefore, developing and implementing the Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC) is imperative and timely. Based on previous research, there are no international guidelines and standards used by organizations that can contribute to the successful implementation and development of SOC. In this regard, this study focuses on highlighting the significant factors that will impact and contribute to the success of SOC. Simultaneously, it will further design a model for the successful development and implementation of SOC for the organization. The study was conducted quantitatively and involved 63 respondents from 25 ministries and agencies in Malaysia. The results of this study will enable the retrieval of ten success factors for SOC, and it specifically focuses on humans, processes, and technology. The descriptive analysis shows that the top management support factor is the most influential factor in the success of the development and implementation of SOC. The study also contributes to the empirical finding that technology and process factors are more significant in the success of SOCs. Based on the regression test, the technology factor has major impact on determining the success of SOC, followed by the process and human factors. Relevant organizations or agencies can use the proposed model to develop and implement SOCs, formulate policies and guidelines, strengthen human models, and enhance cyber security. Copyright: . 
Smart city and cyber-security. technologies used, leading challenges and future recommendations. Today, some cities around the world have tended to use new technologies and become smart city. New technologies improve the quality of citizens’ life. However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues. The research in this study showed that meeting these challenges depends on the hard work of governments, developers of equipment and software and companies providing IT security services. In addition, designing flexible systems with high information protection capabilities is essential to prevent serious security incidents as these incidents can lead to disastrous financial, data, credit and loss of public trust.

A comprehensive review study of cyber-attacks and cyber security. Emerging trends and recent developments. At present, most of the economic, commercial, cultural, social and governmental activities and interactions of countries, at all levels, including individuals, non-governmental organizations and government and governmental institutions, are carried out in cyberspace. Recently, many private companies and government organizations around the world are facing the problem of cyber-attacks and the danger of wireless communication technologies. Today's world is highly dependent on electronic technology, and protecting this data from cyber-attacks is a challenging issue. The purpose of cyber-attacks is to harm companies financially. In some other cases, cyber-attacks can have military or political purposes. Some of these damages are: PC viruses, knowledge breaks, data distribution service (DDS) and other assault vectors. To this end, various organizations use various solutions to prevent damage caused by cyber-attacks. Cyber security follows real-time information on the latest IT data. So far, various methods had been proposed by researchers around the world to prevent cyber-attacks or reduce the damage caused by them. Some of the methods are in the operational phase and others are in the study phase. The aim of this study is to survey and comprehensively review the standard advances presented in the field of cyber security and to investigate the challenges, weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methods. Different types of new descendant attacks are considered in details. Standard security frameworks are discussed with the history and early-generation cyber-security methods. In addition, emerging trends and recent developments of cyber security and security threats and challenges are presented. It is expected that the comprehensive review study presented for IT and cyber security researchers will be useful. Cyber security. Cyber-attacks. Emerging trends. Information technology.

Cybersecurity of robotic systems: Leading challenges and robotic system design methodology. Recent years have seen a rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the growth of autonomous robotic applications which are using network communications. Accordingly, an increasing advancement of intelligent devices with wireless sensors (that means autonomous robotic platforms) operating in challenging environments makes robots a tangible reality in the near future. Unfortunately, as a result of technical development, security problems emerge, especially when considering human–robot collaboration. Two abnormalities often compromise the basic security of collaborative robotic fleets: (a) Information faults and (b) system failures. This paper attempts to describe the methodology of a control framework design for secure robotic systems aided by the Internet of Things. The suggested concept represents a control system structure using blocks as the components. The structure is designed for the robots expected to interact with humans safely and act connected by communication channels. The properties of the components and relations between them are briefly described. The novelty of the proposed concept concerns the security mechanisms. The paper also categorizes two different modes of network attacks summarizing their causal effects on the human–robot collaboration systems. The issue of standardization is also raised. In particular, the works of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and European Parliament (EP) on the security templates for communication channels are commented. Agents.

Fuzzy cognitive scenario mapping for causes of cybersecurity in telehealth services. Hospital organizations have adopted telehealth systems to expand their services to a portion of the Brazilian population with limited access to healthcare, mainly due to the geographical distance between their communities and hospitals. The importance and usage of those services have recently increased due to the COVID-19 state-level mobility interventions. These services work with sensitive and confidential data that contain medical records, medication prescriptions, and results of diagnostic processes. Understanding how cybersecurity impacts the development of telehealth strategies is crucial for creating secure systems for daily operations. In the application reported in this article, the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) translated the complexity of cybersecurity in telehealth services into intelligible and objective results in an expert-based cognitive map. The tool also allowed the construction of scenarios simulating the possible implications caused by common factors that affect telehealth systems. FCMs provide a better understanding of cybersecurity strategies using expert knowledge and scenario analysis, enabling the maturation of cybersecurity in telehealth services. Cybersecurity.

Machine learning cybersecurity adoption in small and medium enterprises in developed countries. In many developed countries, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become important in paving the future path in how data is managed and secured in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sector. SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries’ SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs’ management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs’ lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path.

Asset management method of industrial iot systems for cyber-security countermeasures. Cyber-security countermeasures are important for IIoT (industrial Internet of things) systems in which IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) are integrated. The appropriate asset management is the key to creating strong security systems to protect from various cyber threats. However, the timely and coherent asset management methods used for conventional IT systems are difficult to be implemented for IIoT systems. This is because these systems are composed of various network protocols, various devices, and open technologies. Besides, it is necessary to guarantee reliable and real-time control and save CPU and memory usage for legacy OT devices. In this study, therefore, (1) we model various asset configurations for IIoT systems and design a data structure based on SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol). (2) We design the functions to automatically acquire the detailed information from edge devices by asset configuration management agent, which ensures a low processing load. (3) We implement the proposed asset management system to real edge devices and evaluate the functions. Our contribution is to automate the asset management method that is valid for the cyber security countermeasures in the IIoT systems. Asset management. Control system security. IIoT. SCAP. SysML. 
SCIPS: A serious game using a guidance mechanic to scaffold effective training for cyber security. Training effective simulation scenarios presents numerous challenges from a pedagogical point of view. Through application of the Conceptual Framework for e-Learning and Training (COFELET) as a pattern for designing serious games, we propose the use of the Simulated Critical Infrastructure Protection Scenarios (SCIPS) platform as a prospective tool for supporting the process of providing effective cyber security training. The SCIPS platform is designed to run different scenarios, such as examples in financial forecasting and business infrastructures, with an initial scenario developed in collaboration with industrial partners focusing on an electricity generation plant. Focus groups from these sources were conducted to identify design and developmental considerations for the platform. As an extension from the COFELET framework, we propose an intelligence scaffolding practice as a guidance mechanic taking the form of an agent within the scenario. The agent represents a major innovation in the system and we envisage a deep learning-based augmentation to further adapt towards the behavioural aspects of learners. Collaborative learning.

THE liability for cybersecurity breaches of connected and autonomous vehicles. Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) use, having been tested in various cities around the world and adopted in many areas through public transport, is being prepared for private sector use. The connected dimension of CAV provides for the vehicle to communicate with other vehicles and local infrastructure to operate in a safe manner. Yet, it is this communication of data and operation through software which causes potential problems in the event of the software suffering from unlawful modification (hacking). The consequences of a CAV being hacked could result in its features being compromised resulting in accidents, damage, financial loss, deaths and personal injury. It is also likely that hacking will affect fleets of vehicles operating on the same software version rather than individual vehicles. In this paper we argue there is a need for a strategy to determine how responsibility for the damage and loss caused following the mass hacking of CAVs is to be apportioned. This discussion is presently missing in the evolving literature on CAV maturity and we conclude that a national compensatory body offering a guarantee fund from which victims may seek redress would provide the most appropriate solution for all stakeholders.

Design, Development, and Evaluation of a Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Digital Literacy Game for Tweens. Tweens are avid users of digital media, which exposes them to various online threats. Teachers are primarily expected to teach children safe online behaviours, despite not necessarily having the required training or classroom tools to support this education. Using the theory of procedural rhetoric and established game design principles, we designed a classroom-based cybersecurity, privacy, and digital literacy game for tweens that has since been deployed to over 300 Canadian elementary schools. The game, A Day in the Life of the JOs, teaches children about 25 cybersecurity, privacy, and digital literacy topics and allows them to practice what they have learned in a simulated environment. We employed a user-centered design process to create the game, iteratively testing its design and effectiveness with children and teachers through five user studies (with a total of 63 child participants and 21 teachers). Our summative evaluation with children showed that the game improved their cybersecurity, privacy, and digital literacy knowledge and behavioural intent and was positively received by them. Our summative evaluation with teachers also showed positive results. Teachers liked that the game represented the authentic experiences of children on digital media and that it aligned with their curriculum requirements. they were interested in using it in their classrooms. In this article, we discuss our process and experience of designing a production quality game for children and provide evidence of its effectiveness with both children and teachers. classrooms. educational game. teachers. tweens. usable privacy.

Fast Search of Lightweight Block Cipher Primitives via Swarm-like Metaheuristics for Cyber Security. With the construction and improvement of 5G infrastructure, more devices choose to access the Internet to achieve some functions. People are paying more attention to information security in the use of network devices. This makes lightweight block ciphers become a hotspot. A lightweight block cipher with superior performance can ensure the security of information while reducing the consumption of device resources. Traditional optimization tools, such as brute force or random search, are often used to solve the design of Symmetric-Key primitives. The metaheuristic algorithm was first used to solve the design of Symmetric-Key primitives of SKINNY. The genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm are used to increase the number of active S-boxes in SKINNY, thus improving the security of SKINNY. Based on this, to improve search efficiency and optimize search results, we design a novel metaheuristic algorithm, named particle swarm-like normal optimization algorithm (PSNO) to design the Symmetric-Key primitives of SKINNY. With our algorithm, one or better algorithm components can be obtained more quickly. The results in the experiments show that our search results are better than those of the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm. The search efficiency is significantly improved. The algorithm we proposed can be generalized to the design of Symmetric-Key primitives of other lightweight block ciphers with clear evaluation indicators, where the corresponding indicators can be used as the objective functions.

Semi-quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment by blockade and defense level analysis. Basically, the existing information security risk assessments use mathematics, statistics and computer science to analyze the information assets. Current academic risk assessment methodologies do not completely solve the risk from invisible cyber threats. More research and efforts are needed to fully complement the current risk assessment methodology. The most important things to be supplemented is to review the level of cyber threat blockade and level of appropriate security equipment. Unfortunately, existing methodologies are not concerned with the blockade of cyber threats and the operation of appropriate security equipment. In this paper, the new intrinsic risk assessment method by performing risk assessment is proposed in two directions. First, the risk level of the cyber threats’ influx path is evaluated. Second, the level of defense systems required to treat or quarantine cyber threats that have entered inside is evaluated. BDLA risk management. Blockade and defense level analysis.

The cybersecurity labour shortage in Europe: Moving to a new concept for education and training. Recruiting, retaining and maintaining sufficient numbers of cybersecurity professionals in the workplace is a constant battle, not only for the technical side of cybersecurity, but also for the overlooked area of non-technical, managerial-related jobs in the cyber sector. This paper addresses the lack of cybersecurity skills in the European labour force market and the actions taken to improve the education in cybersecurity for meeting the identified needs. The paper analyses what kind of topics are missing within the cybersecurity curricula of the high-level educational institutions in Europe and in the courses provided by the cybersecurity trainers on the market. The findings are based on the data collected by the surveys carried out by the European competence centres on cybersecurity and the European CyberSecurity organization. These findings show that there are missing topics in the context of higher education cybersecurity programmes and within the private courses offered on the market. The problem of common programme accreditation of European higher education institutes (HEI) and the competence certifications for different work profiles in the area of cybersecurity are briefly presented and discussed as well. The actions undertaken to improve the education in both sectors are presented and the emerging educational landscape is proposed based on our findings. Recommendations to the stakeholders and scholars for improving the current state of cybersecurity education and training are explained in the concluding section. Accreditation and certification.

Security factors on the intention to use mobile banking applications in the UK older generation (55+). A mixed-method study using modified UTAUT and MTAM - with perceived cyber security, risk, and trust. The convenience and accessibility of mobile banking applications has resulted in this becoming the preferred method of banking in the UK. Although popular amongst a younger generation, uptake is significantly lower among the older generation of those aged 55+, with some attributing this to cyber security and privacy concerns. This study proposes a model that can be used to measure the influence of cyber security factors on intention to use mobile banking applications, in the UK 55+. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model was modified to include perceived cyber security risk, perceived cyber security trust, and perceived overall cyber security. Unlike similar studies which have been solely quantitative, this research brings further insight using a mixed-methods approach which harnesses both qualitative and quantitative data. The research model was tested using partial-least-squares structural equation modelling on coded questionnaire data, collected from 191 participants. Qualitative data was analysed through a thematic analysis. Both sets of data were analysed using a final convergent mixed-method. The results show that performance expectancy followed by perceived cyber security risk are the main determinants of intention to use mobile banking applications in the UK 55+.

Cybersecurity through the lens of Digital Identity and Data Protection: Issues and Trends. The use of a secure and robust digital identification system that is capable of protecting privacy is an essential, reliable and user-friendly element for a strong cyber resilience strategy and is a source of new business opportunities and applications for banks, private sector with a return on their investment. The march towards Digital Identity is well underway therefore, focus should be on both adoption and adaption of the new structures and regulations. These are needed to govern the associated services and transactions as well as establishing laws that enforce penalties for violations. There is no doubt then that more and more entities and institutions would move to the cloud. Security challenges affecting the cloud may not be new but the mode of addressing them would be different. The authors develop a Data Colouring technique for securing data processed or stored on both cloud and non-cloud platforms. The technique combines Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), concatenated fingerprints and digital watermarking. Using this technique, data can be secured at creation or during storage and remains secure during processing. Cybersecurity. Digital ecosystems. Digital identity. Economy. National security.

A selective ensemble model for cognitive cybersecurity analysis. Dynamic data-driven vulnerability assessments face massive heterogeneous data contained in, and produced by SOCs (Security Operations Centres). Manual vulnerability assessment practices result in inaccurate data and induce complex analytical reasoning. Contemporary security repositories’ diversity, incompleteness and redundancy contribute to such security concerns. These issues are typical characteristics of public and manufacturer vulnerability reports, which exacerbate direct analysis to root out security deficiencies. Recent advances in machine learning techniques promise novel approaches to overcome these notorious diversity and incompleteness issues across massively increasing vulnerability reports corpora. Yet, these techniques themselves exhibit varying degrees of performance as a result of their diverse methods. We propose a cognitive cybersecurity approach that empowers human cognitive capital along two dimensions. We first resolve conflicting vulnerability reports and preprocess embedded security indicators into reliable data sets. Then, we use these data sets as a base for our proposed ensemble meta-classifier methods that fuse machine learning techniques to improve the predictive accuracy over individual machine learning algorithms. The application and implication of this methodology in the context of vulnerability analysis of computer systems are yet to unfold the full extent of its potential. The proposed cognitive security methodology in this paper is shown to improve performances when addressing the above-mentioned incompleteness and diversity issues across cybersecurity alert repositories. The experimental analysis conducted on actual cybersecurity data sources reveals interesting tradeoffs of our proposed selective ensemble methodology, to infer patterns of computer system vulnerabilities.

A Systematic Framework to Understand Transnational Governance for Cybersecurity Risks from Digital Trade. Governing cybersecurity risks from digital trade is a growing responsibility for governments and corporations. This study develops a systematic framework to delineate and analyze the strategies that governments and corporations take to address cybersecurity risks from digital trade. It maps out the current landscape based on a collection of 75 cases where governments and corporations interact to govern transnational cybersecurity risks. This study reveals that: first, governing cybersecurity risks from digital trade is a global issue whereby most governments implement policies with concerning that the cybersecurity risks embedded within purchasing transnational digital products can influence their domestic political and societal systems. Second, governments dominates the governance interactions by implementing trade policies whereas corporations simply comply. Corporations do, however, have chances to take more active roles in constructing the governance system. Third, supply chain cybersecurity risks have more significant impacts on governance mode between governments and corporations whereas concerns on different national cybersecurity risks do not. Fourth, the interactions between governments and corporations reveal the exisitence of loops that can amplify or reduce cybersecurity risks. This provides policy implications on transnational cybersecurity governance for policy makers and business leaders to consider their potential options and understand the global digital trade environment when cybersecurity and digital trade overlap. 
Serious games as a tool to model attack and defense scenarios for cyber-security exercises. Technology is evolving rapidly. this poses a problem for security specialists and average citizens as their technological skill sets are quickly made obsolete. This makes the knowledge and understanding of cyber-security in a technologically evolving world difficult. Global IT infrastructure and individuals’ privacy are constantly under threat. One way to tackle this problem is by providing continuous training and self-learning platforms. Cyber-security exercises can provide a necessary platform for training people's cyber-security skills. However, conducting cyber-security exercises with new and unique scenarios requires comprehensive planning and commitment to the preparation time and resources. In this work, we propose a serious game for the development of cyber-security exercise scenarios. The game provides a platform to model simulated cyber-security exercise scenarios, transforming them into an emulated cyber-security exercise environment using domain-specific language (DSL) and infrastructure orchestration. In this game, players can play as cyber attackers or defenders in a multiplayer environment to make operational cyber-security decisions in real-time. The decisions are evaluated for the development of operational cyber-attack and defense strategies. Attack. Cyber range. Cyber-security. Defense. Exercises. Scenarios. 
Diagnosing a healthcare cybersecurity crisis: The impact of IoMT advancements and 5G. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology remains in early stages of adoption, but advancements and breakthroughs are quickly moving this process forward. There is a critical need for cybersecurity to be a priority in the development of these new tools, alongside design and utility. Given the rapid pace and potential magnitude of the coming advancements in IoMT, if privacy and security risks are neglected, a significant crisis could emerge in the form of more frequent cybersecurity breaches. This article examines the market opportunities and risks associated with IoMT and outlines a plan for proactively mitigating concerns and providing a platform to foster growth, to modify attitudes and behaviors, and to continue to build consumer confidence in the overall health system without sacrificing security. 5G technology.

A $10 million question and other cybersecurity-related ethical dilemmas amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Cybercrime and cybersecurity are like two sides of the same coin: They are opposites but cannot exist without each other. Their mutual relation generates a myriad of ethical issues, ranging from minor to vital. The rapid development of technology will surely involve even more ethical concerns, like the infamous example of a fitness tracking company allegedly paying $10 million worth of ransom. Every cybersecurity solution, tool, or practice has to be ethical by design if it is to protect people and their rights. To identify the ethical issues that cybersecurity/cybercrime might bring about in the future, we conducted the first broad and comprehensive horizon-scanning study since the COVID-19 pandemic arose. As we began this project, nobody had the slightest idea that the coming months would bring the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the reality we had known was about to change dramatically. As it soon became apparent, the deadly coronavirus brought completely new cybersecurity/cybercrime ethical dilemmas to light, and some of the ones known before were transformed or shifted. This article presents the results of our horizon-scanning study concerning the ethical dilemmas that emerged amid the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19. Cybercrime. Cybersecurity. Data privacy.

Valuing the cyber-attacks budget in high voltage power substations to increase cyber-security. providing a method based on Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process. The level of protection of high voltage power substations depends on the considerations of the electricity company, the level of threats and the value of their assets. On the other hand, the level of countermeasures or defenses for an acceptable level of risk depends on the number of defense equipment at the substation level. Therefore, the number of these countermeasures should be estimated according to the status of each substation and the rate of investment and its importance. In addition, appropriate defense methods depending on their type and condition, as well as how the design and position of the substation can identify system security vulnerabilities. The aim of this paper is to investigate and determine the importance of protecting high voltage power substations against cyber-attacks. For this purpose, power substations are examined in four different groups: geostrategic, industrial strategy, automation and control systems, and vulnerable. According to the decision-making method of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), the defense cost function is presented in each substation, which includes hardware and software equipment and optimal routing of data transmission cables and cable shield. In addition, decisions are made simultaneously between the defender and the attacker. It was found that, from the proposed defense methods, the optimal path for communication cables and hardware equipment used in the power substations was more important than other cases. In addition, by shifting the weights of the criteria of substations 2 and 4, the strategy 3 ranks first in the need for defense budgets among other strategies, accounting for about 49.5% of the total defense budget, and it needs 11.2% more defense budget than the strategy S4. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is provided to examine the impact of various factors as well as to confirm the accuracy of the results. Cyber security. Cyber-attacks.

Informing cybersecurity strategic commitment through top management perceptions: The role of institutional pressures. Given the financial consequences of security breaches, security risk management has gained more attention in board rooms and garnered more involvement from top management. We undertake a study to understand the top managers’ role in cybersecurity strategy, specifically with cyberinsurance. This study draws from institutional and upper echelons theories to explain how top managers’ values and perceptions mediate the impact of external institutional pressures on the commitment to use cyberinsurance as a risk management strategy. We empirically test proposed hypotheses using data collected from executive-level managers of various firms and perform semi-structured interviews of six case sites as post hoc analysis. The results suggest that institutional pressures positively affect top managers’ perceptions of job security, breach risk, financial risk, transaction cost, and regulatory oversight. In turn, these perceptions influence their commitment to cyberinsurance. We find that values and perceptions of personal relevance have a significant impact on their strategic decisions. The findings emphasize the critical role that top management plays in mediating the influence of institutional pressures on cybersecurity strategy. Implications for research and practice, along with limitations and future directions, are discussed. Cyberinsurance. Cybersecurity strategy. Institutional theory. Risk management. Top management.

Economic model for evaluating the value creation through information sharing within the cybersecurity information sharing ecosystem. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, the constructs of the cybersecurity information sharing ecosystem have been defined in detail. Using this ecosystem, the interrelationships among the stakeholders with respect to cybersecurity information sharing are analyzed, the value parameters are determined, the value functions are defined, and the values obtained by the stakeholders through simulation are calculated. Furthermore, it is investigated whether the stakeholders involved in this ecosystem can create sufficient value to sustain in the market. The outcome of this research includes an economic model for evaluating the value creation and distribution among the stakeholders. This model is a critical step forward to better align the values (i.e., utilities and profits) of stakeholders. The simulation results of the model show that end users are the main source of value generation. Cybersecurity solution providers and cybersecurity information providers get benefits from a growing installed base of end users. However, in saturated markets, there is a risk of un-sustainability of the ecosystem, as the cost of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity information cannot be recovered through their fees. The simulation model and the findings of this study can help business managers to make better decisions related to business strategies, sustainability, and pricing schemes for cybersecurity solution and cybersecurity information. Moreover, a working cybersecurity information sharing ecosystem is essential for the adoption of cloud computing and, especially, edge computing.

Thus, this survey aims to provide with a comprehensive review of techniques and elements that have been proposed to achieve cybersecurity in blockchain-based systems. The analysis is intended to target area researchers, cybersecurity specialists and blockchain developers. For this purpose, we analyze 272 papers from 2013 to 2020 and 128 industrial applications. We summarize the lessons learned and identify several matters to foster further research in this area. Blockchain. Cybersecurity. 
Time-frequency based cyber security defense of wide-area control system for fast frequency reserve. Global power systems are transiting from conventional fossil fuel energy to renewable energies due to their environmental benefits. The increasing penetration of renewable energies presents challenges for power system operation. The efficiency and sufficiency of responsive reserves have become increasingly important for power systems with a high proportion of renewable energies. The Fast Frequency Reserve (FFR), especially the Wide-area Monitoring System (WAMS)-based FFR, is a promising and effective solution to secure and enhance the stability of power systems. However, cyber security has become a new challenge for the WAMS-based FFR system. Cyber attacks on the FFR control system may threaten the safety of power system operation due to the rapid power controllability requirement of FFR. To address this problem, a time-frequency based cyber security defense framework is proposed to detect the cyber spoofing of synchrophasor data in WAMS-based FFR control systems. This paper first introduces the Continuous Wavelet Transforms (CWTs) to decompose spoofing signals. Then, the Dual-frequency Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNN) is proposed to identify the time-frequency domains matrix from two frequency scales. Integrating CWTs and DSCNN, an identification framework called CWTs-DSCNN is further proposed to detect the spoofing attacks in the WAMS-based FFR system. Multiple experiments using the actual data from FNET/GridEye are performed to verify the effectiveness of the framework in securing WAMS-based FFR systems.

Hacking Humans? Social Engineering and the Construction of the Deficient User in Cybersecurity Discourses. Today, social engineering techniques are the most common way of committing cybercrimes through the intrusion and infection of computer systems. Cybersecurity experts use the term social engineering to highlight the human factor in digitized systems, as social engineering attacks aim at manipulating people to reveal sensitive information. In this paper, we explore how discursive framings of individual versus collective security by cybersecurity experts redefine roles and responsibilities at the digitalized workplace. We will first show how the rhetorical figure of the deficient user is constructed vis-à-vis notions of (in)security in social engineering discourses. Second, we will investigate the normative tensions that these practices create. To do so, we link work in science and technology studies on the politics of deficit construction to recent work in critical security studies on securitization and resilience. Empirically, our analysis builds on a multi-sited conference ethnography during three cybersecurity conferences as well as an extensive document analysis. Our findings suggest a redistribution of institutional responsibility to the individual user through three distinct social engineering story lines—the oblivious employee, speaking code and social, and fixing human flaws. Finally, we propose to open up the discourse on social engineering and its inscribed politics of deficit construction and securitization and advocate for companies and policy makers to establish and foster a culture of collective cyber in/security and corporate responsibility. critical security studies. cybersecurity. hacking. politics of deficit construction. resilience. securitization. social engineering. 
Cybersecurity management for distributed control system: systematic approach. Distributed control systems are the backbone of modern industrial revolution. Its utilization ranges from industries like agriculture, automobiles, petrochemical and refineries to nuclear power plants. Inclusion of cyber capabilities to distributed control systems exposed it to security risk especially once used for critical infrastructure of a country. It is critical for distributed control systems to effectively manage its cybersecurity risks and attacks. In this research, a consolidated cybersecurity management approach is developed which is based on cyclic phases that addresses the risk, security, testing and trust factors of distributed control systems within cyber physical systems domain. This research also identified trust and reputation as two additional components to be included in managing distributed control systems’ cybersecurity. This method enhances the level of security required to safeguard distributed control systems. Control systems. Cyber physical systems. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity management.

Software supply chain attacks, a threat to global cybersecurity: SolarWinds’ case study. Exploitation of a vulnerability that compromised the source code of the Solar Winds’ Orion system, a software that is used widely by different government and industry actors in the world for the administration and monitoring of networks. brought to the fore a type of stealth attack that has been gaining momentum: supply chain attacks. The main problem in the violation of the software supply chain is that, from 85% to 97% of the code currently used in the software development industry comes from the reuse of open source code frameworks, repositories of third-party software and APIs, creating potential vulnerabilities in the development cycle of a software product. This research analyzes the SolarWinds case study from an exploratory review of academic literature, government information, but also from the articles and reports that are published by different cybersecurity consulting firms and software providers. Then, a set of good practices is proposed such as: Zero trust, Multi-Factor authentication mechanisms (MFA), strategies such as SBOM and the recommendations of the CISA guide to defend against this type of attack. Finally, the research discusses about how to improve response times and prevention against this type of attacks, also future research related to the subject is suggested, such as the application of Machine Learning and Blockchain technologies. Additionally for risk reduction, in addition to the management and articulation of IT teams that participate in all the actors that are part of the software life cycle under a DevSecOps approach.

Cybersecurity awareness framework for academia. Cybersecurity is a multifaceted global phenomenon representing complex socio-technical challenges for governments and private sectors. With technology constantly evolving, the types and numbers of cyberattacks affect different users in different ways. The majority of recorded cyberat-tacks can be traced to human errors. Despite being both knowledge-and environment-dependent, studies show that increasing users’ cybersecurity awareness is found to be one of the most effective protective approaches. However, the intangible nature, socio-technical dependencies, constant technological evolutions, and ambiguous impact make it challenging to offer comprehensive strategies for better communicating and combatting cyberattacks. Research in the industrial sector focused on creating institutional proprietary risk-aware cultures. In contrast, in academia, where cybersecurity awareness should be at the core of an academic institution’s mission to ensure all graduates are equipped with the skills to combat cyberattacks, most of the research focused on understanding students’ attitudes and behaviors after infusing cybersecurity awareness topics into some courses in a program. This work proposes a conceptual Cybersecurity Awareness Framework to guide the implementation of systems to improve the cybersecurity awareness of graduates in any academic institution. This framework comprises constituents designed to continuously improve the development, integration, delivery, and assessment of cybersecurity knowledge into the curriculum of a university across different disciplines and majors. this framework would thus lead to a better awareness among all university graduates, the future workforce. This framework may be adjusted to serve as a blueprint that, once adjusted by academic institutions to accommodate their missions, guides institutions in developing or amending their policies and procedures for the design and assessment of cybersecurity awareness.

Methodological perspective for assessing european consumers’ awareness of cybersecurity and sustainability in e-commerce. The increasing European consumer awareness of cybersecurity and sustainability issues in e-commerce is raising key methodological concerns. In a field like this, still unexplored by scholars, it is crucial to identify reliable data as well as to choose the modalities of combining primary and secondary data. As the robustness of the outcome of a study on a complex issue is highly sensitive to the quality of the data used, this paper is a communication that aims to complement and support previously published empirical research. This communication describes the methodological path to collect, integrate, and process data from different sources to interpret European consumers’ attitudes towards cybersecurity and sustainability during e-commerce. In fact, COVID-19 has driven many users to shop online, raising concerns especially about the security of digital transactions. Scientific studies analyzing these effects are still lacking in the literature and therefore this paper aims to fill this gap. The limits of a rigid dataset such as Eurostat’s are overcome by integrating the results of European citizens’ behavior during online purchases, with a survey that involved some experts appropriately selected by the research team. The combination of primary and secondary sources of data and the application of a hybrid methodological approach using MCDA (multi-criteria decision analysis) and a Likert scale allowed new information that fills some gaps in the literature to be extracted from the data. How European citizens correlate e-commerce with cybersecurity and sustainability emerged, thus providing important insights for decision-makers. Consumers’ awareness. Cybersecurity. E-commerce.

The impact of cybersecurity practices on cyberattack damage: The perspective of small enterprises in Saudi Arabia. Small and medium-sized enterprises represent the majority of enterprises globally and yet have some difficulties in understanding the impact that cybersecurity threats could have on their businesses and the damage they could do to their assets. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of security practices at small-sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia in the event of a cybersecurity attack. Our paper is among the first research papers to measure the effectiveness of cybersecurity practices and the threat posed by cybersecurity breaches among small enterprises in the event of cybersecurity attacks. A total of 282 respondents participated, all of them representing small-sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia. The study applies multiple regression tests to analyze the effectiveness of 12 cybersecurity practices in three aspects: financial damage, loss of sensitive data, and restoration time, at small enterprises. The findings indicate that having an inspection team and a recovery plan may limit the financial damage caused by cybersecurity attacks on small enterprises. The results also show that cybersecurity awareness, knowledge of cybersecurity damage, and professionals’ salaries were related to the loss of sensitive data. Furthermore, the results indicate that contact with cybersecurity authorities and having an inspection team have statistically significant effects on restoration time. Cybersecurity. Data loss.

Hospitals’ cybersecurity culture during the COVID-19 crisis. The coronavirus pandemic led to an unprecedented crisis affecting all aspects of the concurrent reality. Its consequences vary from political and societal to technical and economic. These side effects provided fertile ground for a noticeable cyber-crime increase targeting critical infrastructures and, more specifically, the health sector. the domain suffering the most during the pandemic. This paper aims to assess the cybersecurity culture readiness of hospitals’ workforce during the COVID-19 crisis. Towards that end, a cybersecurity awareness webinar was held in December 2020 targeting Greek Healthcare Institutions. Concepts of cybersecurity policies, standards, best practices, and solutions were addressed. Its effectiveness was evaluated via a two-step procedure. Firstly, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed at the end of the webinar and voluntarily answered by attendees to assess the comprehension level of the presented cybersecurity aspects. Secondly, a post-evaluation phishing campaign was conducted approximately four months after the webinar, addressing non-medical employees. The main goal was to identify security awareness weaknesses and assist in drafting targeted assessment campaigns specifically tailored to the health domain needs. This paper analyses in detail the results of the aforementioned approaches while also outlining the lessons learned along with the future scientific routes deriving from this research. COVID-19.

Healthcare information technology: Fast and accurate information access vs. cyber-security. The term health information technology (health IT) refers to the electronic systems that store, share, analyze, and protect electronic health records. It includes also electronic prescribing, knowledge sharing, patient support tools, and mobile health technology together with decision-making algorithms. The privacy, security, and ethics of health information are priority for both patients and healthcare providers. The health IT is a target for cyber-criminals. stolen health information, or blackmailing via different kind of cryptolockers, is good on the black market. While the healthcare industry relies more on technology, cyber-attacks are threatening health IT. This article argues health IT issues from two perspectives. The first one is a physician's point of view aiming to improve quality of care using fast and accurate health IT. The second is the standpoint of cyber-security specialists aiming to protect data form cyber-criminals, continually developing new strategies and best practices. Copyright . Cryptolocker.

Cyber security in control of grid-tied power electronic converters - Challenges and vulnerabilities. Grid-tied power electronic converters are key enabling technologies for interfacing renewable energy sources, energy storage, electrical vehicles, microgrids, and high-voltage dc transmission lines with the electrical power grid. As the number of power converters in modern grids continually increases, their monitoring and coordinated control in a way to support the grid have become topics of increased practical and research interest. In connection with this, latest standards have also defined a mandatory set of control parameters for grid-tied converters, which should be adjustable by a remote entity that sends commands through a communication network. While such a remote control capability allows many new control functions in grid-tied converters, it also renders them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The aim of this article is first to shed light on the portions of the power converter control systems that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Next, typical cyber-attacks are overviewed by considering different applications of the grid-tied converters. Further, the impact of different types of cyber-attacks on grid support functions is studied. Finally, this article is concluded with summary and recommendation for further research. Cyber-attacks.

Exploring the relationship between technology adoption and cyber security compliance: A quantitative study of UTAUT2 model. IT infrastructure and systems are made up of technical and social systems that work together to ensure that organization's goals and objectives are met. Security controls and measures are developed and used to protect an organization's data and information systems. To improve cyber security, organizations focus most of their efforts on incorporating new technological approaches in products and processes, leaving out the most important and vulnerable factor. So this study intends to provide some practical implications to the technology developers and policymakers while identifying the factors that affect cyber security compliance in an organization or home environment for general users, HR, IT administrators, engineers, and others. It explored the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model and assessed the effect of its factors on cyber security compliance in organizations. Copyright .

Development of cybersecurity technology and algorithm based on quantum computing. Many hacking incidents are linked to work files because most companies work with them. However, a variety of file encryption and decryption methods have been proposed. Existing file encryption/decryption technologies are under threat as hacking technologies advance, necessitating the development of stronger encryption algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm and use quantum computing to encrypt/decrypt AES image files. Because the shift is regular during the AES Shift Row procedure, the change technique led the shift to become irregular when using quantum random walk. Computing resources and speeds were simulated using IBM Qiskit quantum simulators for performance evaluation, whereas encryption performance was assessed using number of pixels change rate (NPCR) and unified average changing intensity (UACI).

Leveraging aviation risk models to combat cybersecurity threats in vehicular networks. The rapidly developing technology and lack of standards in the transportation industry for the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks, which all vehicles will operate under, drives concern about information validity and authenticity due to the risk of erroneous or malicious information being injected into a vehicular network (VN). In this paper, we apply a risk management process to a vehicular network that will identify hazards and possible controls that can lower their risk. After researching and reviewing various technologies along with several risk models, we have developed a basic framework for assessing and assigning risk through a phased method that leads to input for our developed model.

Norm Entrepreneurship in Global Cybersecurity. New technologies create new challenges for global security that leave even the most militarily powerful countries vulnerable to attack. Countries are gearing up for electronic warfare and, in this realm, the old rules of international conflict either do not apply or have not been developed. Governments have yet to find stable policy solutions to match potential cyber threats. The challenge then is to establish new global norms concerning acceptable behavior in cyberspace. This article analyzes the attempts to construct global cybersecurity norms. It differs from much of the existing literature on norm-construction since it moves beyond the interstate level to examine subnational groups and private sector actors that function as norm entrepreneurs in this policy area. The article posits that while nation states remain central, nonstate actors are playing an increasingly important role in cybersecurity norm-building, supplementing state action, and, to some degree, compensating for state inaction when cooperation reaches an impasse.

Developing a cyber security culture: Current practices and future needs. While the creation of a strong security culture has been researched and discussed for decades, it continues to elude many businesses. Part of the challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent academic findings and research into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential factors are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture. For research, we produce an up-to-date characterisation of the field and also define open issues deserving of further attention such as the role of change management processes and national culture in an enterprise's cyber security culture.

A principlist framework for cybersecurity ethics. The ethical issues raised by cybersecurity practices and technologies are of critical importance. However, there is disagreement about what is the best ethical framework for understanding those issues. In this paper we seek to address this shortcoming through the introduction of a principlist ethical framework for cybersecurity that builds on existing work in adjacent fields of applied ethics, bioethics, and AI ethics. By redeploying the AI4People framework, we develop a domain-relevant specification of five ethical principles in cybersecurity: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We then illustrate the advantages of this principlist framework by examining the ethical issues raised by four common cybersecurity contexts: penetration testing, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), ransomware, and system administration. These case analyses demonstrate the utility of this principlist framework as a basis for understanding cybersecurity ethics and for cultivating the ethical expertise and ethical sensitivity of cybersecurity professionals and other stakeholders.

A survey of new orientations in the field of vehicular cybersecurity, applying artificial intelligence based methods. Nowadays, cybersecurity is an emerging research area in the automotive industry, and it is investigated by many different perspectives. Our article is a review of existing vehicular security solutions that covers the state-of-the-art and future research directions. This article is a new contribution to tutorials/surveys related to the vehicular cybersecurity domain with the latest details. We developed a database from 140 articles from the field of automotive security. In the database, we assigned specific attributes to every article (such as Web of Science Impact Factor or the number of citations). The data set was analyzed by the K-means clustering and decision tree analysis methods to identify and characterize the generated groups of papers. Following this, the article highlights the research areas that might receive more attention in the future. Accordingly, the result of the current research can be applied by the decision-makers, researchers, and Original Equipment Manufacturers to allocate additional resources to those domains, which is expected to shape the future of vehicular security. 
An Autonomous Cybersecurity Framework for Next-generation Digital Service Chains. Today, the digital economy is pushing new business models, based on the creation of value chains for data processing, through the interconnection of processes, products, services, software, and things across different domains and organizations. Despite the growing availability of communication infrastructures, computing paradigms, and software architectures that already effectively support the implementation of distributed multi-domain value chains, a comprehensive architecture is still missing that effectively fulfills all related security issues: mutual trustworthiness of entities in partially unknown topologies, identification and mitigation of advanced multi-vector threats, identity management and access control, management and propagation of sensitive data. In order to fill this gap, this work proposes a new methodological approach to design and implement heterogeneous security services for distributed systems that combine together digital resources and components from multiple domains. The framework is designed to support both existing and new security services, and focuses on three novel aspects: (i) full automation of the processes that manage the whole system, i.e., threat detection, collection of information and reaction to attacks and system anomalies. (ii) dynamic adaptation of operations and security tasks to newest attack patterns, and (iii) real-time adjustment of the level of detail of inspection and monitoring processes. The overall architecture as well as the functions and relationships of its logical components are described in detail, presenting also a concrete use case as an example of application of the proposed framework.

The social and cultural shaping of cybersecurity capacity building: a comparative study of nations and regions. This paper presents an empirical study of the social and cultural aspects of cybersecurity capacity building in 78 nations. While nations within geographically defined regions might be expected to share similar attitudes, values, and practices around cybersecurity, this analysis finds that regional differences can be explained largely by cross-national differences in development and the scale of Internet use. These results question the centrality of regions in shaping social and cultural attributes directly tied to cybersecurity capacity. However, the analysis identifies some countries with greater and some with lesser levels of maturity in capacity building than expected only on the basis of their development and scale of Internet use. Further research focused on the dynamics of under- and over-performance of different nations might illuminate where regional contexts could place a brake on, or provide an impetus for, under- or over-performance in cybersecurity capacity building. That said, national development and the scale of Internet use are the most explanatory of cultural attitudes, values, and practices of societies tied to cybersecurity, such as trust on the Internet.

The Benefits and Costs of Cybersecurity Risk Reduction: A Dynamic Extension of the Gordon and Loeb Model. This article develops a dynamic extension of the classic model of cybersecurity investment formulated by Gordon and Loeb. In this dynamic model, results are influenced by the rate at which cybersecurity assets depreciate and the rate of return on investment. Depreciation costs are lower in the dynamic model than is implicitly assumed in the classic model, while the rate-of-return threshold is higher. On balance, the user cost of cybersecurity assets is lower in the dynamic model than is implicitly assumed in the classic model. This difference increases the economically efficient size of the cybersecurity system in value terms, increasing the efficient level of risk reduction.

Emerging technologies and problem definition uncertainty: The case of cybersecurity. For governments to regulate, they must first define the problem and decide which policymakers have the authority to make decisions. Technological development can disrupt the authority-allocation process by fostering uncertainty about which actors are responsible for making policy. This article examines the role that changing technology has played in the development of cybersecurity policy in the United States. New technologies have increased the type and scope of assets vulnerable to cyberthreats, and with them the number of governing units who can claim jurisdiction over cybersecurity-related issues. Uncertainty about the nature of the problem has led the U.S. Congress to rely heavily on bureaucratic witnesses and focus on how existing regulations can be brought to bear. Emerging technologies create regulatory challenges for governance not only through unforeseen consequences but through uncertainty over who can regulate. Fragmented authority can produce piecemeal responses and a reliance on existing frameworks that benefit regulated industries. cybersecurity. emerging technology. problem definition. regulation.

Cybersecurity Breach and Crisis Response: An Analysis of Organizations’ Official Statements in the United States and South Korea. Cybersecurity breaches have rapidly become a high-impact crisis for many corporations. Thus, it is critically important for corporations to know how to protect their reputation through effective crisis communication. Considering the scarcity of empirical research on cybersecurity breaches in crisis communication, the current study attempts to fill this research gap. This study compared 108 official statements issued by organizations in the United States and South Korea when cybersecurity breaches threatened the reputations of various corporations. The characteristics of an apology (responsibility admittance, sympathetic expression, reassurance, compensation) and other features of crisis response (use of excuses, functions of apology, and organizational representation) were examined. This study found that the features of the official statements differed by cultural dimension (individualism vs. collectivism, small vs. large power distance) and by communication style (low-context vs. high-context communication). corporate apology. corporate reputation. crisis communication. cultural difference. data breach.

The relationship between cybersecurity ratings and the risk of hospital data breaches. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the progression of healthcare cybersecurity over 2014-2019 as measured by external risk ratings. We further examined the relationship between hospital data breaches and cybersecurity ratings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Fortune 1000 firms as a benchmark, time trends in hospital cybersecurity ratings were compared using linear regression. Further, the relationship between hospital data breaches and cybersecurity ratings was modeled using logistic regression. Hospital breach data were collected from US HHS, and cybersecurity ratings were provided by BitSight. The resulting study sample yielded 3528 hospital-year observations. RESULTS: In aggregate, we found that hospitals had significantly lower cybersecurity ratings than Fortune 1000 firms, however, hospitals have closed the gap in recent years. We also found that hospitals with the low security ratings were associated with significant risk of a data breach, with the probability of a breach in a given year ranging from 14% to 33%. DISCUSSION: Recent cyber-attacks in healthcare continue to illustrate the need to better secure information systems. While hospitals have reduced cyber risk over the past decade, they remain statistically more vulnerable than the Fortune 1000 firms against botnets, spam, and malware. CONCLUSION: Policy makers should continue encouraging acute-care hospitals to proactively invest in security controls that reduce cyber risk. Best practices from other sectors like the financial services sector could provide useful guides and benchmarks for improvement. cybersecurity. health information technology. hospital data breach. risk rating. 
Cybersecurity regulatory landscape in India: Digitisation on the hook?. The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the fore digital technology that not only facilitated a swift response but also greased the wheels of the economy by enabling work from home and online business, among others. However, digitisation has accelerated the need for cybersecurity and its regulation. The article critically examines the technical meaning and legal definition of cybersecurity. The Information Technology Act of 2000 and rules made therein have, in an incremental manner, build the legal edifice for cybersecurity. Nevertheless, the rapid advancement in technology (IoT, AI, Cloud, 5G) and its diffusion has made the protection of critical information infrastructure vulnerable. There is a need to identify the critical sectors-health, space, election and assess the obligation on the private sector to share threat information and cyber incident demands recalibrating the current cybersecurity governance in India. 
The use of computer games for teaching and learning cybersecurity in higher education institutions. In higher education, teaching cybersecurity concepts to students such as encryption-based security protocols is a challenging task, but it is fundamental for personal and national security. One of the reasons for this is related to the inadequate mathematical knowledge of students, which limits their understanding of the cryptographic algorithms underlying the protocols. Therefore, higher education institutions are seeking out engaging and effective strategies for developing students' skills in this area. The aim of this research is to explore the use and potential effectiveness of game-based learning to assist in the teaching and learning of cybersecurity concepts in higher education. It contributes to the literature by raising public interest in cybersecurity and helping learners to understand suitable and safe behaviors online. It also offers a systematic overview of game-based learning tools that have been used in previous studies to improve students' understanding of cryptographic algorithms. This research also presents a framework for the effective teaching of cryptography in higher education, relying on animation and gamification. Computer game-based learning. Cryptography.

The can bus in the maritime environment – technical overview and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus standard was developed in the 1980s and is in widespread use in automobile, vehicular, aviation, and other networks. The CAN bus was introduced in the maritime environment with the adoption of the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) 2000 standard in the late-1990s. Many papers have been written about the CAN bus protocols and security vulnerabilities but there is sparse literature about use of the CAN bus in the maritime environment. Part I of this paper is a technical overview, describing CAN bus standards and operation, with particular attention to its use with the NMEA 2000 maritime communications standard. Part II of this paper describes security vulnerabilities in terms of loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (such as eavesdropping, denial-of-service, and spoofing), and mitigations specific to the maritime environment. 
The EU's cybersecurity: A strategic narrative of a cyber power or a confusing policy for a local common market?. In the last decade, cybersecurity has swiftly turned into a strategic issue and became an important horizontal policy area in the EU, which is treated in this article as one of the four contemporary political empires. These days, the policy arguably encompasses both internal and external aspects, often making it difficult to assess the level of its actual effectiveness as well as outreach. Initially, the EU's introverted vision on the issue drove the policy to focus on cyber resilience and strategic autonomy. Evidently, the EU's strategic narrative that could assist it in leading the process of creating an open, free, stable and secure cyberspace in the digital decade, in the context of international security, is emerging. Thus, this contribution is to test the argument that the EU, utilizing an imperial paradigm (consciously or not), is gradually becoming a global steering power in cybersecurity. In this article, firstly, we identify and examine the process of formation of the EU's narratives about (its) cyber power. Secondly, we establish a discussion framework to highlight the methodological relevance of the imperial paradigm, cyber power Europe and Strategic Narrative Theory for a multidisciplinary debate on global geo-strategic redesign, in which the EU takes part. Thirdly, we look into bilateral and multilateral forums and processes that deal with cybersecurity and in which the EU participates, in order to understand more specifically how the EU is projecting its cyber-power narratives internationally and how cybersecurity-associated challenges impact current dynamics in other policy domains in the field of international relations.

Impact of Human Vulnerabilities on Cybersecurity. Today, security is a major challenge linked with computer network companies that cannot defend against cyber-attacks. Numerous vulnerable factors increase security risks and cyber-attacks, including viruses, the internet, communications, and hackers. Internets of Things (IoT) devices are more effective, and the number of devices connected to the internet is constantly increasing, and governments and businesses are also using these technologies to perform business activities effectively. However, the increasing uses of technologies also increase risks, such as password attacks, social engineering, and phishing attacks. Humans play a major role in the field of cybersecurity. It is observed that more than 39% of security risks are related to the human factor, and 95% of successful cyber-attacks are caused by human error, with most of them being insider threats. The major human factor issue in cybersecurity is a lack of user awareness of cyber threats. This study focuses on the human factor by surveying the vulnerabilities and reducing the risk by focusing on human nature and reacting to different situations. This study highlighted that most of the participants are not experienced with cybersecurity threats and how to protect their personal information. Moreover, the lack of awareness of the top three vulnerabilities related to the human factor in cybersecurity, such as phishing attacks, passwords, attacks, and social engineering, are major problems that need to be addressed and reduced through proper awareness and training.

Successful Gamification of Cybersecurity Training. The behavioral aspect of cybersecurity has gained more attention in recent years. By their actions, people can improve the security of their devices and organizations, but also hinder the successful implementation of security in these areas. As awareness campaigns where information is merely distributed are not effective, we designed a cybersecurity serious game applicable for cybersecurity training. The effectiveness of this game was experimentally tested against a noncybersecurity game that did or did not contain cybersecurity information, through measures of the theory of planned behavior. Results showed that the cybersecurity game resulted in higher self-reported scores on attitudes, perceived behavioral control, intentions, and behavior compared with both noncybersecurity games. For subjective norms, we only found an effect in the comparison between the cybersecurity game and the noncybersecurity game without additional information. behavior change. behavioral cybersecurity. cybersecurity training. gamification. serious games. theory of planned behavior. 
Perceived Vulnerability As a Determinant of Increased Risk for Cybersecurity Risk Behavior. There is interest in better understanding people's cybersecurity (CS)-related attitudes and behaviors, which are ultimately impacted by their perceived vulnerability to CS risks. There is a relationship between how risk is perceived and how someone acts, with protection motivation theory (PMT) providing a particularly salient framework for explaining this connection. Exploration of how one perceives his or her own vulnerability to CS victimization is essential to understanding this interaction, and risk mitigation of threats relies heavily on the human despite increased reliance on digital technologies such as machine learning that can be used proactively and in real time yet are still impacted by human behavior. This study sought to examine the information security attitudes and behaviors that contribute to perceived CS vulnerability. A convenience sample of 612 college students sampled from two public universities in the United States completed a brief demographic survey and the Online Security Behavior and Beliefs Questionnaire. The instrument demonstrated good internal reliability with an index of perceived vulnerability significantly and positively correlating with multiple subscales. Linear regression indicated subscales that tended to focus more on one's inner belief that he or she is capable and competent enough to understand the nature of CS risks was predictive of perceived vulnerability, potentially resulting from a social desirability response bias which yielded an overly favorable self-report. PMT suggests that knowledge is an essential factor influencing decision making and results of this study suggest that perceived vulnerability may depend upon the appraisal of experience more so than one's actual knowledge or competence. cybersecurity. perceived vulnerability. protection motivation theory. risk mitigation. 
Caregivers' Role in Cybersecurity for Aging Information Technology Users with Intellectual Disabilities. Information technology (IT) users with intellectual disabilities (ID) are likely to experience online privacy violations without adequate support from their caregivers. Given that aging users face additional challenges when using IT than their younger counterparts, the goal of this exploratory study is to investigate caregivers' strategies and barriers for helping to protect the privacy of aging IT users with ID. Six caregivers (four paid caregivers, two family members) of aging users with ID completed a series of six focus groups about their experiences assisting the people they support with using IT, including their strategies and barriers for helping to protect these users' privacy. Participants were also asked about their own attitudes and experiences related to online privacy and information security. Based on our inductive thematic analysis of the qualitative data, participants used three main strategies to help protect the privacy of aging users with ID: (1) restricting access to personal information, (2) limiting disclosure of personal details, and (3) providing just-in-time instruction and feedback. We also identified four key barriers to privacy protection: (1) limited awareness and knowledge about information security, (2) balancing privacy and autonomy, (3) maintaining professional boundaries, and (4) residential care services' policies. Inclusive and transdisciplinary research is needed to address the elevated privacy and security risks for aging IT users with ID, and provide caregivers with training on how to support this population to use IT safely. Technology developers should create solutions to decrease aging users with ID's dependence on caregivers for privacy protection. aging. caregivers. cognitive disabilities. cybersecurity. information technology. intellectual disability. privacy. 
Cybersecurity in power grids: Challenges and opportunities. Increasing volatilities within power transmission and distribution force power grid operators to amplify their use of communication infrastructure to monitor and control their grid. The resulting increase in communication creates a larger attack surface for malicious actors. Indeed, cyber attacks on power grids have already succeeded in causing temporary, large-scale blackouts in the recent past. In this paper, we analyze the communication infrastructure of power grids to derive resulting fundamental challenges of power grids with respect to cybersecurity. Based on these challenges, we identify a broad set of resulting attack vectors and attack scenarios that threaten the security of power grids. To address these challenges, we propose to rely on a defense-in-depth strategy, which encompasses measures for (i) device and application security, (ii) network security, and (iii) physical security, as well as (iv) policies, procedures, and awareness. For each of these categories, we distill and discuss a comprehensive set of state-of-the art approaches, as well as identify further opportunities to strengthen cybersecurity in interconnected power grids.

Distributed ledger for cybersecurity: Issues and challenges in railways. The railway is a complex technical system of systems in a multi-stakeholder environment. The implementation of digital technologies is essential for achieving operational excellence and addressing stakeholders’ needs and requirements in relation to the railways. Digitalization is highly dependent on an appropriate digital infrastructure provided through proper information logistics, whereas cybersecurity is critical for the overall security and safety of the railway systems. However, it is important to understand the various issues and challenges presented by governance, business, and technical requirements. Hence, this paper is the first link in the chain to explore, understand, and address such requirements. The purpose of this paper is to identify aspects of distributed ledgers and to provide a taxonomy of issues and challenges to develop a secure and resilient data sharing framework for railway stakeholders.

Academic research on the role of corporate governance and it expertise in addressing cybersecurity breaches: Implications for practice, policy, and research. Frequent cyber-attacks on organizations in the last decade have caught the attention of practitioners and governance bodies, who have called for boards to take a more active role in managing and preventing future cyber risks. Governance surveys, however, find that boards are not sufficiently prepared to address cybersecurity risks due to a lack of IT expertise. Firms have begun appointing technology experts, creating board-level technology (IT) committees and delegating responsibilities to the audit committee as a means of managing cybersecurity risk. With the aim of understanding the current and future role of governance mechanisms in managing cybersecurity risks, this paper reviews the existing cybersecurity guidelines and regulations, and summarizes the empirical research related to corporate governance, security breaches, and IT expertise in overseeing cyber risks. Finally, we discuss implications for practice, policy, and researchers. Audit committee. Board IT expertise. Board of directors. CEO IT expertise. Corporate gover-nance. Cybersecurity.

Investigation of cyber-security and cyber-crimes in oil and gas sectors using the innovative structures of complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations. Recently, there has been enormous development due to advancements in technology. Industries and enterprises are moving towards a digital system, and the oil and gas industries are no exception. There are several threats and risks in digital systems, which are controlled through cyber-security. For the first time in the theory of fuzzy sets, this research analyzes the relationships between cyber-security and cyber-crimes in the oil and gas sectors. The novel concepts of complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations (CIFRs) are introduced. Moreover, the types of CIFRs are defined and their properties are discussed. In addition, an application is presented that uses the Hasse diagram to make a decision regarding the most suitable cyber-security techniques to implement in an indus-try. Furthermore, the omnipotence of the proposed methods is explained by a comparative study. Block chain. Cartesian product. Complex intuition-istic fuzzy set. Complex intuitionistic fuzzy relation.

How to reduce the cybersecurity breach contagion effect. This article discusses a recent study titled ‘‘Do voluntary disclosures mitigate the cybersecurity beach contagion effect?’’ (Kelton and Pennington 2020). The study finds voluntary cybersecurity disclosures can provide firms protection from contagion effects, a phenomenon where the negative impact of a cybersecurity breach at an industry peer firm spills over to other bystander firms in the same industry. This article offers practical implications of the study for financial reporting executives, boards of directors, and auditors. Contagion effects. Cybersecurity. Disclosure. 
Avoidance of cybersecurity threats with the deployment of a web-based blockchain-enabled cybersecurity awareness system. Modern information technology (IT) is well developed, and almost everyone uses the features of IT and services within the Internet. However, people are being affected due to cybersecurity threats. People can adhere to the recommended cybersecurity guidelines, rules, adopted standards, and cybercrime preventive measures to largely mitigate these threats. The ignorance of or lack of cybersecurity knowledge also causes a critical problem regarding confidentiality and privacy. It is not possible to fully avoid cybercrimes that often lead to sufficient business losses and spread forbidden themes (disgust, extremism, child porn, etc.). Therefore, to reduce the risk of cybercrimes, a web-based Blockchain-enabled cybersecurity awareness program (WBCA) process is introduced in this paper. The proposed WBCA trains users to improve their security skills. The proposed program helps with understanding the common behaviors of cybercriminals and improves user knowledge of cybersecurity hygiene, best cybersecurity practices, modern cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and trends. Furthermore, the proposed WBCA uses Blockchain technology to protect the program from potential threats. The proposed program is validated and tested using real-world cybersecurity topics with real users and cybersecurity experts. We anticipate that the proposed program can be extended to other domains, such as national or corporate courses, to increase the cybersecurity awareness level of users. A CentOS-based virtual private server is deployed for testing the proposed WBCA to determine its effectiveness. Finally, WBCA is also compared with other state-of-the-art web-based programs designed for cybersecurity awareness. Blockchain technology. Cyber awareness. Cybercrime. Cybersecurity basics.

Source Authentication of Distribution Synchrophasors for Cybersecurity of Microgrids. This letter proposes a hybrid approach combining Self-Adaptive Mathematical Morphology (SAMM) and Time-Frequency (TF) techniques to authenticate the source information of Distribution Synchrophasors (DS) within near-range locations. The SAMM can adaptively regulate the synchrophasors variations which are representatives of local environmental characteristics. Subsequently, TF mapping is employed to extract informative signatures from the regulated synchrophasors variation. Finally, Random Forest Classification (RFC) is used to correlate the extracted signatures with the source information based on the derived TF mapping. Experiment results using DS collected at multiple small geographical scales validated the proposed methodology. cyber-physical security. Distribution network. source authentication. synchrophasors. 
Cybersecurity analysis of load frequency control in power systems: A survey. Today, power systems have transformed considerably and taken a new shape of geographically distributed systems from the locally centralized systems thereby leading to a new infrastructure in the framework of networked control cyber-physical system (CPS). Among the different important operations to be performed for smooth generation, transmission, and distribution of power, maintaining the scheduled frequency, against any perturbations, is an important one. The load frequency control (LFC) operation actually governs this frequency regulation activity after the primary control. Due to CPS nature, the LFC operation is vulnerable to attacks, both from physical and cyber stand-points. The cyber-attack strategies ranges from a variety of attacks such as jamming the network communication, time-delay attack, and false data injection. Motivated by these perspectives, this paper studies the cybersecurity issues of the power systems during the LFC operation, and a survey is conducted on the security analysis of LFC. Various cyber-attack strategies, their mathematical models, and vulnerability assessments are performed to understand the possible threats and sources causing failure of frequency regulation. The LFC operation of two-area power systems is considered as a tutorial example to quantify the vulnerabilities. Mitigation strategies through control theoretic approaches are then reviewed and highlighted for LFC operation under cyber-attack. Area control error. Control theory. Cybersecurity.

Defence against the dark artefacts: Smart home cybercrimes and cybersecurity standards. This paper analyses the assumptions underpinning a range of emerging EU and UK smart home cybersecurity standards. We use internet of things (IoT) case studies (such as the Mirai Botnet affair) and the criminological concept of ‘routine activity theory’ to situate our critique. Our study shows that current cybersecurity standards mainly assume smart home environments are (and will continue to be) underpinned by cloud architectures. This is a shortcoming in the longevity of standards. This paper argues that edge computing approaches, such as personal information management systems, are emerging for the IoT and challenge the cloud focused assumptions of these standards. In edge computing, data can be stored in a decentralised manner, locally and analysed on the client using federated learning. This can have advantages for security, privacy and legal compliance, over centralised cloud-based approaches, particularly around cross border data flows and edge based security analytics. As a consequence, standards should start to reflect the increased interest in this trend to make them more aspirational and responsive for the long term. as ultimately, current IoT architectures are a choice, as opposed to inherent. Our paper unpacks the importance of the adoption of edge computing models which could enable better management of external cyber-criminality threats in smart homes. We also briefly discuss challenges of building smart homes that can accommodate the complex nature of everyday life in the home. In addition to technical aspects, the social and interactional complexities of the home mean internal threats can also emerge. As these human factors remain unresolved in current approaches to smart home cybersecurity, a user's security can be impacted by such technical design choices. Cloud. Edge computing.

The global cyber security model: Counteracting cyber attacks through a resilient partnership arrangement. In this paper, insights are provided into how senior managers can establish a global cyber security model that raises cyber security awareness among staff in a partnership arrangement and ensures that cyber attacks are anticipated and dealt with in real time. We deployed a qualitative research strategy that involved a group interview involving cyber security and intelligence experts. The coding approach was used to identify the themes in the data and, in addition, a number of categories and subcategories were identified. The mind map approach was utilized to identify the thought processes of senior managers in relation to ensuring that the cyber security management process is effective. The global cyber security model can be used by senior managers to establish a framework for dealing with a range of cyber security attacks, as well as to upgrade the cyber security skill and knowledge base of individuals. In order for a cyber security mentality to be established, senior managers need to ensure that staff are focused on organizational vulnerability and resilience, there is an open and transparent communication process in place, and staff are committed to sharing cyber security knowledge. By placing cyber security within the context of a partnership arrangement, senior managers can adopt a collectivist approach to cyber security and benefit from the knowledge of external experts.

Multi-type relational clustering for enterprise cyber-security networks. Several cyber-security data sources are collected in enterprise networks providing relational information between different types of nodes in the network, namely computers, users and ports. This relational data can be expressed as adjacency matrices detailing inter-type relationships corresponding to relations between nodes of different types and intra-type relationships showing relationships between nodes of the same type. In this paper, we propose an extension of Non-Negative Matrix Tri-Factorisation (NMTF) to simultaneously cluster nodes based on their intra and inter-type relationships. Existing NMTF based clustering methods suffer from long computational times due to large matrix multiplications. In our approach, we enforce stricter cluster indicator constraints on the factor matrices to circumvent these issues. Additionally, to make our proposed approach less susceptible to variation in results due to random initialisation, we propose a novel initialisation procedure based on Non-Negative Double Singular Value Decomposition for multi-type relational clustering. Finally, a new performance measure suitable for assessing clustering performance on unlabelled multi-type relational data sets is presented. Our algorithm is assessed on both a simulated and real computer network against standard approaches showing its strong performance. Cyber-security. Multi-type relational clustering.

Cybersecurity Assessment Framework for Digital Interface Between Safety and Security at Nuclear Power Plants. This study aims to assess the cybersecurity aspects of nuclear power plants (NPPs) in regards to a digital safety-security interface. In traditional and advanced NPPs, safety and security functions are performed by analogue and digital systems. The risk of unauthorized software changing real-world system behaviors is a major and critical infrastructure safety and security issue. Within this context, a NPP is one of the most emblematic examples of critical infrastructure cyber targets. In this study, an evaluation of the functional impact of a cyber-attack targeting specific digital equipment in a nuclear facility is performed by means of a nuclear power plant simulator specifically developed for cybersecurity assessments, deployment of realistic cyber-attack simulation scenarios, and collection and evaluation of simulated data. The Asherah nuclear power plant simulator reproduces the dynamic behavior of a two-loop 2,772 MWt pressurized water reactor (PWR) including primary, secondary, and tertiary loops, as well as selected network infrastructure elements, communication protocols, and control systems. The system is projected to survive cyber-attacks, to allow great flexibility for digital systems and network research, and to allow the capture of data for an a posteriori analysis. The preliminary simulation results obtained by the deployment of realistic cyber-attack scenarios facilitated an understanding of the impacts of cyber-attacks, how they propagate in nuclear digital cyber-physical systems and their consequences, both in terms of plant security and safety.

Beware suppliers bearing gifts!: Analysing coverage of supply chain cyber security in critical national infrastructure sectorial and cross-sectorial frameworks. Threat actors are increasingly targeting extended supply chains and abusing client-supplier trust to conduct third-party compromise. Governments are concerned about targeted attacks against critical national infrastructures, where compromise can have significant adverse national consequences. In this paper we identify and review advice and guidance offered by authorities in the UK, US, and the EU regarding Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM). We then conduct a review of sector specific guidance in the three regions for the chemical, energy, and water sectors. We assessed frameworks that each region's sector offered organisations for C-SCRM suitability. Our results found a range of interpretations for Supply Chain that resulted in a diversity in the quantity and quality of advice offered by regional authorities, sectors, and their frameworks. This is exacerbated by the lack of a common taxonomy to support supply chain procurement and risk management that has led to limited coverage in most C-SCRM programs. Our results highlight the need for a taxonomy regarding C-SCRM and systematic guidance (both general and sector specific) to enable controls to be deployed to mitigate against supply chain risk. We provide an outline taxonomy based on our data analysis to promote further discussion and research. Common taxonomy. Critical national infrastructure. Cyber security. Risk management.

A new approach to combine multiplex networks and time series attributes: Building intrusion detection systems (IDS) in cybersecurity. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are fundamental tools in cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we present a new methodology for the creation of intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on a strategy that combines the use of multiplex networks and time series analysis to provide a probability that an IP address be an attacker in a certain time. This approach reduces the number of alerts to a small number of IP addresses as well as the computation effort by not having to analyze each event independently. The evaluation of all traffic happens only at pre-defined times. The methodology relies on both the original utilization of some unsupervised machine learning techniques and on the use of certain time series attributes and their representation as a complex multiplex network, achieving a very significant reduction in the dimensionality of the resulting data representation. The result is a very effective intrusion detection system in large corporate environments and a new approach in the representation of the analyzed data as shown in the real case presented.

Cybersecurity: Risk management framework and investment cost analysis. As organizations accelerate digital transformation with mobile devices, cloud services, social media, and Internet of Things services, cybersecurity has become a key priority in enterprise risk management. While improving cybersecurity leads to higher levels of customer trust and increased revenue opportunities, rapidly evolving data protection and privacy regulations have complicated cybersecurity management. Against the backdrop of rapidly rising cyberbreaches and the emergence of novel cybersecurity technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, this article introduces a cyber risk management framework, discusses a cyber risk assessment process, and illustrates a continuous improvement of cybersecurity performance and cyberinvestment cost analysis with a real-world cybersecurity example.

Developing a modified total interpretive structural model (M-TISM) for organizational strategic cybersecurity management. Cybersecurity is a serious issue that many organizations face these days. Therefore, cybersecurity management is very important for any organization. Organizations should learn to deal with these cyber threats through effective management across all business functions. The main purpose of this study is to identify the factors that affect cybersecurity within an organization and analyze relationships among these factors. The modified total interpretive structural modeling (M-TISM) technique is used to build a hierarchical model and define the common interactions between the factors. This study presents the impact of collaboration, training, resources and capabilities, information flow, technology awareness, and technological infrastructure on effective cybersecurity management. In addition, the study also explains the interrelationships among the identified factors in the M-TISM model. Cybersecurity. M-TISM. Modified total interpretive structural modeling. Strategy. 
Bayesian Stackelberg games for cyber-security decision support. A decision support system for cyber-security is here presented. The system aims to select an optimal portfolio of security controls to counteract multi-stage attacks. The system has several components: a preventive optimisation to select controls for an initial defensive portfolio, a learning mechanism to estimate possible ongoing attacks, and an online optimisation selecting an optimal portfolio to counteract ongoing attacks. The system relies on efficient solutions of bi-level optimisations, in particular, the online optimisation is shown to be a Bayesian Stackelberg game solution. The proposed solution is shown to be more efficient than both classical solutions like Harsanyi transformation and more recent efficient solvers. Moreover, the proposed solution provides significant security improvements on mitigating ongoing attacks compared to previous approaches. The novel techniques here introduced rely on recent advances in Mixed-Integer Conic Programming (MICP), strong duality and totally unimodular matrices. Attack graphs. Bayesian Stackelberg games.

Board liability for cyberattacks: The effects of a prior attack and implementing the AICPA's cybersecurity framework. A significant litigation trend is the rise in lawsuits filed against boards of directors following cybersecurity incidents. We perform an experiment to examine factors we predict will influence directors’ litigation risk. We examine whether jurors are more likely to hold directors liable when a company previously experienced an immaterial cyberattack, and whether subsequently implementing the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ cybersecurity risk management reporting and assurance framework (the Framework) can mitigate the effects of a prior attack. Consistent with counterfactual reasoning theory, we find jurors are more likely to hold directors liable for a cyberattack when a company previously experienced an attack. Importantly, we also find that directors can reduce this liability risk after a prior cyberattack by subsequently implementing the Framework, especially when they obtain external assurance. Our results have important implications for research, boards, regulators and public policymakers, audit firms, and attorneys who handle cybersecurity-related cases. AICPA framework. Assurance.

When Trust Fades, Facebook Is No Longer a Friend: Shifting Privatisation Dynamics in the Context of Cybersecurity as a Result of Disinformation, Populism and Political Uncertainty. This article discusses how populism and political uncertainty are impacting on one of the main current trends in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, namely the privatisation of JHA. Through an exploration of a cybersecurity policy case study, the article proposes to understand how the privatisation of internal security, which has resulted in private actors shaping JHA policies and regulation, is currently being disrupted. Through the use of the theoretical lenses of Regulatory Capitalism, the article argues that this change is directly related to a reduction in trust relations between the State and certain private sector actors, which occurs when priorities in addressing populism and political uncertainty are perceived to diverge. area of freedom. cybersecurity. political uncertainty. security and justice. security privatization. 
An Improvised Patchwork: Success and Failure in Cybersecurity Policy for Critical Infrastructure. The last two decades have revealed the vulnerability of privately owned critical infrastructure—the power grid, pipelines, financial networks, and other vital systems—to cyberattack. The central U.S. response to this challenge has been a series of sectoral partnerships with private owner-operators of critical infrastructure, involving varying degrees of regulation. Qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews with over 40 policymakers and senior private sector managers, as well as public documents, reveals considerable variation in how well this approach has worked in practice. The main predictors of policy success appear to be (a) the nature of the cyber threat to firms’ operations and (b) regulatory pressure on firms. However, other factors—such as the nature of intra-industry competition—also affect how well the current regime works in specific sectors. Our findings have implications for public administration on civilian cybersecurity, as well as ramifications for regulation in other policy domains. 
Scoping the ethical principles of cybersecurity fear appeals. Fear appeals are used in many domains. Cybersecurity researchers are also starting to experiment with fear appeals, many reporting positive outcomes. Yet there are ethical concerns related to the use of fear to motivate action. In this paper, we explore this aspect from the perspectives of cybersecurity fear appeal deployers and recipients. We commenced our investigation by considering fear appeals from three foundational ethical perspectives. We then consulted the two stakeholder groups to gain insights into the ethical concerns they consider to be pertinent. We first consulted deployers: (a) fear appeal researchers and (b) Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), and then potential cybersecurity fear appeal recipients: members of a crowdsourcing platform. We used their responses to develop an effects-reasoning matrix, identifying the potential benefits and detriments of cybersecurity fear appeals for all stakeholders. Using these insights, we derived six ethical principles to guide cybersecurity fear appeal deployment. We then evaluated a snapshot of cybersecurity studies using the ethical principle lens. Our contribution is, first, a list of potential detriments that could result from the deployment of cybersecurity fear appeals and second, the set of six ethical principles to inform the deployment of such appeals. Both of these are intended to inform cybersecurity fear appeal design and deployment. Cybersecurity. Ethical principles. Ethics. Fear appeals. 
War, Health and Ecosystem: Generative Metaphors in Cybersecurity Governance. Policy-makers involved in cybersecurity governance should pay close attention to the ‘generative metaphors’ they use to describe and understand new technologies. Generative metaphors structure our understanding of policy problems by imposing mental models of both the problem and possible solutions. As a result, they can also constrain ethical reasoning about new technologies, by uncritically carrying over assumptions about moral roles and obligations from an existing domain. The discussion of global governance of cybersecurity problems has to date been dominated by the metaphor of ‘cyber war’. In this paper, I argue that this metaphor diminishes possibilities for international collaboration in this area by limiting states to reactive policies of naming and shaming rather than proactive actions to address systemic features of cyberspace. We suggest that alternative metaphors—such as health, ecosystem, and architecture—can help expose the dominance of the war metaphor and provide a more collaborative and conceptually accurate frame for negotiations.

General Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Model: Best Practice to Achieve Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Compliance. The use of technology in the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 is essential, marked by the use of technology in the economy and business. This situation makes many companies in the payment sector have to improve their information technology security systems. In Indonesia, Bank Indonesia and the Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan - OJK) are agencies that provide operational permits for companies by making Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) certification as one of the requirements for companies to obtain operating permits. However, not all companies can easily get PCI-DSS certification because many companies still do not meet the PCI-DSS requirements. The research offers a methodology for measuring the level of technology and information maturity using general cybersecurity requirements adopted from the cybersecurity frameworks of CIS, NIST, and Cobit. Then, the research also performs qualitative calculations based on interviews, observations, and data surveys conducted on switching companies that have been able to implement and obtain certification. PCI-DSS to produce practical cybersecurity measures, in general, can be used as a measure of the maturity of technology and information security. The results and discussion provide a model assessment tool on the procedures and requirements needed to obtain PCI-DSS certification. The maturity level value of PT XYZ is 4.0667 at maturity level 4, namely quantitatively managed, approaching level 5 as the highest level at maturity level. Best practice.

Cyber-attack scoring model based on the offensive cybersecurity framework. Cyber-attacks have become commonplace in the world of the Internet. The nature of cyber-attacks is gradually changing. Early cyber-attacks were usually conducted by curious personal hackers who used simple techniques to hack homepages and steal personal information. Lately, cyber attackers have started using sophisticated cyber-attack techniques that enable them to retrieve national confidential information beyond the theft of personal information or defacing websites. These sophisticated and advanced cyber-attacks can disrupt the critical infrastructures of a nation. Much research regarding cyber-attacks has been conducted. however, there has been a lack of research related to measuring cyber-attacks from the perspective of offensive cybersecurity. This motivated us to propose a methodology for quantifying cyber-attacks such that they are measurable rather than abstract. For this purpose, we identified each element of offensive cybersecurity used in cyber-attacks. We also investigated the extent to which the detailed techniques identified in the offensive cyber-security framework were used, by analyzing cyber-attacks. Based on these investigations, the complexity and intensity of cyber-attacks can be measured and quantified. We evaluated advanced persistent threats (APT) and fileless cyber-attacks that occurred between 2010 and 2020 based on the methodology we developed. Based on our research methodology, we expect that researchers will be able to measure future cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks. Offensive cybersecurity. Offensive cybersecurity framework. Scoring model. 
Cybersecurity against the loopholes in industrial control systems using interval-valued complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations. Technology is rapidly advancing and every aspect of life is being digitalized. Since technology has made life much better and easier, so organizations, such as businesses, industries, companies and educational institutes, etc., are using it. Despite the many benefits of technology, several risks and serious threats, called cyberattacks, are associated with it. The method of neutralizing these cyberattacks is known as cybersecurity. Sometimes, there are uncertainties in recognizing a cyberattack and nullifying its effects using righteous cybersecurity. For that reason, this article introduces interval-valued complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations (IVCIFRs). For the first time in the theory of fuzzy sets, we investigated the relationships among different types of cybersecurity and the sources of cyberattacks. Moreover, the Hasse diagram for the interval-valued complex intuitionistic partial order set and relation is defined. The concepts of the Hasse diagram are used to inspect different cybersecurity techniques and practices. Then, using the properties of Hasse diagrams, the most beneficial technique is identified. Furthermore, the best possible selection of types of cybersecurity is made after putting some restrictions on the selection. Lastly, the advantages of the proposed methods are illuminated through comparison tests. Cybercrime. Cybersecurity. Hasse diagram. Interval-valued complex intuitionistic fuzzy relations.

On the assessment of cyber risks and attack surfaces in a real-time co-simulation cybersecurity testbed for inverter-based microgrids. The integration of variable distributed generations (DGs) and loads in microgrids (MGs) has made the reliance on communication systems inevitable for information exchange in both control and protection architectures to enhance the overall system reliability, resiliency and sustainability. This communication backbone in turn also exposes MGs to potential malicious cyber attacks. To study these vulnerabilities and impacts of various cyber attacks, testbeds play a crucial role in managing their complexity. This research work presents a detailed study of the development of a real-time co-simulation testbed for inverter-based MGs. It consists of a OP5700 real-time simulator, which is used to emulate both the physical and cyber layer of an AC MG in real time through HYPERSIM software. and SEL-3530 Real-Time Automation Controller (RTAC) hardware configured with ACSELERATOR RTAC SEL-5033 software. A human–machine interface (HMI) is used for local/remote monitoring and control. The creation and management of HMI is carried out in ACSELERATOR Diagram Builder SEL-5035 software. Furthermore, communication protocols such as Modbus, sampled measured values (SMVs), generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) and distributed network protocol 3 (DNP3) on an Ethernet-based interface were established, which map the interaction among the corresponding nodes of cyber-physical layers and also synchronizes data transmission between the systems. The testbed not only provides a real-time co-simulation environment for the validation of the control and protection algorithms but also extends to the verification of various detection and mitigation algorithms. Moreover, an attack scenario is also presented to demonstrate the ability of the testbed. Finally, challenges and future research directions are recognized and discussed. Cyber-physical system (CPS).

A hybrid mcdm model combining danp and promethee ii methods for the assessment of cybersecurity in industry 4.0. IT technologies related to Industry 4.0 facilitate the implementation of the framework for sustainable manufacturing. At the same time, Industry 4.0 integrates IT processes and systems of production companies with IT solutions of cooperating companies that support a complete manu-factured product life cycle. Thus, the implementation of sustainable manufacturing implies a rapid increase in interfaces between IT solutions of cooperating companies. This, in turn, raises concerns about security among manufacturing company executives. The lack of a recognized methodology supporting the decision-making process of choosing the right methods and means of cybersecurity is, in effect, a significant barrier to the development of sustainable manufacturing. As a result, the propagation of technologies in Industry 4.0 and the implementation of the sustainable manufacturing framework in companies are slowing down significantly. The main novelty of this article, addressing the above deficiencies, is the creation, using the combined DEMATEL and ANP (DANP) and PROMETHEE II methods, of a ranking of the proposed three groups of measures, seven dimensions and twenty criteria to be implemented in companies to ensure cybersecurity in Industry 4.0 and facilitate the implementation of the sustainable production principles. The contribution of Industry 4.0 components and the proposed cybersecurity scheme to achieve the Sustainable Development goals, reducing the carbon footprint of companies and introducing circular economy elements was also indicated. Using DANP and PROMETHEE II, it can be concluded that: (i) the major crite-rion of cybersecurity in companies is validation and maintaining electronic signatures and seals. (ii) the most crucial area of cybersecurity is network security. (iii) the most significant group of measures in this regard are technological measures. Carbon footprint. Cybersecurity. DANP.

CyberEyes: Cybersecurity Entity Recognition Model Based on Graph Convolutional Network. Cybersecurity has gradually become the public focus between common people and countries with the high development of Internet technology in daily life. The cybersecurity knowledge analysis methods have achieved high evolution with the help of knowledge graph technology, especially a lot of threat intelligence information could be extracted with fine granularity. But named entity recognition (NER) is the primary task for constructing security knowledge graph. Traditional NER models are difficult to determine entities that have a complex structure in the field of cybersecurity, and it is difficult to capture non-local and non-sequential dependencies. In this paper, we propose a cybersecurity entity recognition model CyberEyes that uses non-local dependencies extracted by graph convolutional neural networks. The model can capture both local context and graph-level non-local dependencies. In the evaluation experiments, our model reached an F1 score of 90.28% on the cybersecurity corpus under the gold evaluation standard for NER, which performed better than the 86.49% obtained by the classic CNN-BiLSTM-CRF model.

Concept of using eye tracking technology to assess and ensure cybersecurity, functional safety and usability. Eye tracking technology is based on tracking the trajectory of human eye movement. As a rule, it is implemented in the form of an additional device attached under the monitor or in the form of glasses. On the basis of a mathematical model, the focus of a person's attention is calculated and, accordingly, the user's visual route is built. Eye tracking technology is used to solve various problems, e.g. for marketing research, assessing the quality of user interfaces, developing simulators for operators, etc. The article discusses the concept of using eye tracking technology to assess and ensure cyber security, functional safety and usability. The possibility of using eye tracking technology (ETT) to solve the problem of identifying a person's personality is considered separately. The solution is achieved by reproducing a certain trajectory by a person's vision. This technique can be used as a basic or additional technique for identifying a person's personality. It also analyzes the results of using eye tracking to study the interface of an automated information system for operator support based on algorithms for symptom-oriented emergency instructions (ASOEI), which is used at nuclear power plants (NPP).

PocketCTF: A fully featured approach for hosting portable attack and defense cybersecurity exercises. Capture the flag (CTF) challenges are broadly used for engaging trainees in the technical aspects of cybersecurity, maintaining hands-on lab exercises, and integrating gamification elements. However, deploying the appropriate digital environment for conducting cybersecurity exercises can be challenging and typically requires a lot of effort and system resources by educators. In this paper, we present PocketCTF, an extensible and fully independent CTF platform, open to educators to run realistic virtual labs to host cybersecurity exercises in their classrooms. PocketCTF is based on containerization technologies to minimize the deployment effort and to utilize less system resources. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of deploying CTF challenges that allows the trainees to engage not only in offensive security but also in defensive tasks that have to be conducted during cybersecurity incidents. When using PocketCTF, educators can deploy hands-on labs, spending less time on the deployment and without necessarily having the advanced technical background to deploy complex labs and scenarios.

Respite for smes: A systematic review of socio-technical cybersecurity metrics. Cybersecurity threats are on the rise, and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to cope with these developments. To combat threats, SMEs must first be willing and able to assess their cybersecurity posture. Cybersecurity risk assessment, generally performed with the help of metrics, provides the basis for an adequate defense. Significant challenges remain, however, especially in the complex socio-technical setting of SMEs. Seemingly basic questions, such as how to aggregate metrics and ensure solution adaptability, are still open to debate. Aggregation and adaptability are vital topics to SMEs, as they require the assimilation of metrics into an actionable advice adapted to their situation and needs. To address these issues, we systematically review socio-technical cybersecurity metric research in this paper. We analyse aggregation and adaptability considerations and investigate how current findings apply to the SME situation. To ensure that we provide valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, we integrate our results in a novel socio-technical cybersecurity framework geared towards the needs of SMEs. Our framework allowed us to determine a glaring need for intuitive, threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment approaches for the least digitally mature SMEs. In the future, we hope our framework will help to offer SMEs some deserved respite by guiding the design of suitable cybersecurity assessment solutions. Cybersecurity. Metrics. SME. Socio-technical.

Cost benefits of using machine learning features in NIDS for cyber security in UK small medium enterprises (SME). Cyber security has made an impact and has challenged Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in their approaches towards how they protect and secure data. With an increase in more wired and wireless connections and devices on SME networks, unpredictable malicious activities and interruptions have risen. Finding the harmony between the advancement of technology and costs has always been a balancing act particularly in convincing the finance directors of these SMEs to invest in capital towards their IT infrastructure. This paper looks at various devices that currently are in the market to detect intrusions and look at how these devices handle prevention strategies for SMEs in their working environment both at home and in the office, in terms of their credibility in handling zero-day attacks against the costs of achieving so. The experiment was set up during the 2020 pandemic referred to as COVID-19 when the world experienced an unprecedented event of large scale. The operational working environment of SMEs reflected the context when the UK went into lockdown. Pre-pandemic would have seen this experiment take full control within an operational office environment. however, COVID-19 times has pushed us into a corner to evaluate every aspect of cybersecurity from the office and keeping the data safe within the home environment. The devices chosen for this experiment were OpenSource such as SNORT and pfSense to detect activities within the home environment, and Cisco, a commercial device, set up within an SME network. All three devices operated in a live environment within the SME network structure with employees being both at home and in the office. All three devices were observed from the rules they displayed, their costs and machine learning techniques integrated within them. The results revealed these aspects to be important in how they identified zero-day attacks. The findings showed that OpenSource devices whilst free to download, required a high level of expertise in personnel to implement and embed machine learning rules into the business solution even for staff working from home. However, when using Cisco, the price reflected the buy-in into this expertise and Cisco’s mainframe network, to give up-to-date information on cyber-attacks. The requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulations Act (GDPR) were also acknowledged as part of the broader framework of the study. Machine learning techniques such as anomaly-based intrusions did show better detection through a commercially subscription-based model for support from Cisco compared to that of the OpenSource model which required internal expertise in machine learning. A cost model was used to compare the outcome of SMEs’ decision making, in getting the right framework in place in securing their data. In conclusion, finding a balance between IT expertise and costs of products that are able to help SMEs protect and secure their data will benefit the SMEs from using a more intelligent controlled environment with applied machine learning techniques, and not compromising on costs.

Conceptual model of visual analytics for hands-on cybersecurity training. Hands-on training is an effective way to practice theoretical cybersecurity concepts and increase participants' skills. In this article, we discuss the application of visual analytics principles to the design, execution, and evaluation of training sessions. We propose a conceptual model employing visual analytics that supports the sensemaking activities of users involved in various phases of the training life cycle. The model emerged from our long-term experience in designing and organizing diverse hands-on cybersecurity training sessions. It provides a classification of visualizations and can be used as a framework for developing novel visualization tools supporting phases of the training life-cycle. We demonstrate the model application on examples covering two types of cybersecurity training programs. Classification. Cybersecurity. Educatio. Hands-on training. Visual analytics. 
Cybersecurity and privacy risk assessment of point-of-care systems in healthcare—a use case approach. Point-of-care systems are generally used in healthcare to respond rapidly and prevent critical health conditions. Hence, POC systems often handle personal health information. and consequently, their cybersecurity and privacy requirements are of crucial importance. While, assessing these requirements is a significant task. In this work, we propose a use case approach to assess specifications of cybersecurity and privacy requirements of POC systems in a structured and self-contained form. Such an approach is appropriate since use cases are one of the most common means adopted by developers to derive requirements. As a result, we detail a use case approach in the framework of a real-based healthcare IT infrastructure that includes a health information system, integration engines, application servers, web services, medical devices, smartphone apps and medical modalities (all data simulated) together with the interaction with participants. Since our use case also sustains the analysis of cybersecurity and privacy risks in different threat scenarios, it also supports decision making and the analysis of compliance considerations.

Cybersecurity in automotive: An intrusion detection system in connected vehicles. Today’s modern vehicles are connected to a network and are considered smart objects of IoT, thanks to the capability to send and receive data from the network. One of the greatest challenges in the automotive sector is to make the vehicle secure and reliable. In fact, there are more connected instruments on a vehicle, such as the infotainment system and/or data interchange systems. Indeed, with the advent of new paradigms, such as Smart City and Smart Road, the vision of Internet of Things has evolved substantially. Today, we talk about the V2X systems in which the vehicle is strongly connected with the rest of the world. In this scenario, the main aim of all connected vehicles vendors is to provide a secure system to guarantee the safety of the drive and persons against a possible cyber‐attack. So, in this paper, an embedded Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the automotive sector is introduced. It works by adopting a two‐step algorithm that provides detection of a possible cyber‐attack. In the first step, the methodology provides a filter of all the messages on the Controller Area Network (CAN‐Bus) thanks to the use of a spatial and temporal analysis. if a set of messages are possibly malicious, these are analyzed by a Bayesian network, which gives the probability that a given event can be classified as an attack. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, an experimental campaign was conducted to evaluate them, according to the classic evaluation parameters for a test’s accuracy. These results were compared with a common data set on cyber‐attacks present in the literature. The first experimental results, obtained in a test scenario, seem to be interesting. The results show that our method has good correspondence in the presence of the most common cyber‐attacks (DDoS, Fuzzy, Impersonating), obtaining a good score relative to the classic evaluation parameters for a test’s accuracy. These results have decreased performance when we test the system on a Free State Attack. Automotive. Bayesian network. CAN‐bus. Cybersecurity. Embedded systems. Internet of Things.

Physical cyber-security algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Today, the wireless sensor network (WSN) plays an important role in our daily life. In addition, it is used in many applications such as military, medical, greenhouse, and transport. Due to the sending data between its nodes or to the base station requires a connection link, the sensor nodes can be exposed to the many attacks that exploit the weaknesses of the network. One of the most important types of these attacks is the denial of service (DoS). DoS attack exhausts the system's resources that lead the system to be out of service. In this paper, a cyber-security algorithm is proposed for physical level of WSN that adopts message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol for data transmission and networking. This algorithm predicts the DoS attacks at the first time of happening to be isolated from the WSN. It includes three stages of detecting the attack, predicting the effects of this attack and preventing the attacks by excluding the predicted nodes from the WSN. We applied a type of DoS attack that is a DoS injection attack (DoSIA) on the network protocol. The proposed algorithm is tested by adopting three case studies to cover the most common cases of attacks. The experiment results show the superior of the proposed algorithm in detecting and solving the cyber-attacks. broker. Cyber-security. DoS attack Embedded system MQTT. 
Cybersecurity in Water Sector: Stakeholders Perspective. Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure systems are becoming a significant concern. Sabotage and destruction of critical infrastructures may cause devastating impacts on physical systems, economic security, public health, and safety. The water sector is one of the most critical infrastructures, and as such, identifying and managing cyber threats on the water sector's facilities is crucial to providing a continuous and safe supply of water. This study reports on a stakeholder engagement process conducted in the form of an active workshop that aims to show different stakeholder's perspective on cyber threats, knowledge gaps, and barriers to implementations of cybersecurity procedures and technologies in the water sector. The workshop, demonstrated on the Israeli water and cyber sectors, brought together 45 professionals from the water and cyber sectors (government, academia, utilities, consultants, and commercial suppliers). In the cybersecurity domain, many studies focused on developing algorithms, but only a few considered the organizational and policy aspects of the problem. The present study addresses this gap and presents an example demonstrating the importance of integrating stakeholder engagement into decision making in the water domain. The workshop's findings are summarized and analyzed to highlight top priority activity areas and suggest required actions according to the stakeholders' perspective, which can help shape the landscape of the water sector's cybersecurity.

A Blockchain-Based Deep Learning Approach for Cyber Security in Next Generation Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. With the recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) in the next generation cyber-physical system (CPS) such as autonomous driving, there is a significant requirement of big data analysis with high accuracy and low latency. For efficient big data analysis, deep learning (DL) supports strong analytic capability. it has been applied at the cloud and edge layers by extensive research to provide accurate data analysis at low latency. However, existing researches failed to address certain challenges, such as centralized control, adversarial attacks, security, and privacy. To this end, we propose DeepBlockIoTNet, a secure DL approach with blockchain for the IoT network wherein the DL operation is carried out among the edge nodes at the edge layer in a decentralized, secure manner. The blockchain provides a secure DL operation and removes the control from a centralized authority. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach supports higher accuracy.

A cybersecurity user authentication approach for securing smart grid communications. The smart grid provides technology that offers power solutions by integrating wireless access, renewable energy resources, smart meters, and smart appliances. Energy harvesting and distribution is automated through remotely operated commands using information and communication technology. Common issues in integrating power grid with technology include security threat that reduces the expected assimilation performance. In the present work, a cybersecurity-assisted authentication method for smart grids is introduced to overcome false data flow. This method pre-estimates the energy requirement of the meters, depending on previously acquired information. Authentication-dependent security is provided according to the pre-estimated energy requirement and distribution manner. Variations in smart grid data for energy allocation are monitored based on network and end-user consumption until the users' current connection time. This method provides individual authentication for power-sharing and user verification, thereby improving false data's detection rate. Results show that the proposed method required less detection time (4.67 s) without increasing the overload for end-users. Cybersecurity. False data. Smart grid. User authentication. 
Cyber security framework for smart home energy management systems. Smart homes provide reliable automation control over different applications and appliances that are connected through intelligent networks. The concern of energy management is improved by providing connected and one-touch services with energy systems knowledge. External and internal attacks over the energy management systems degrade its performance by energy exploitations or increasing energy demands. This paper proposes an online security framework (OSF) for smart energy management systems (EMS). The proposed framework is responsible for monitoring EMS operations and mitigating security threats at different time intervals. The proposed OSF Monitoring aims to inform consumers of their use pattern, which uses energy Monitoring systems to store, analyze, and subsequently provide the systems to the service provider with valuable information. For this purpose, the proposed framework monitors the variations in energy distribution and consumption based on the routine factor. It then determines the variations based on the appliances/applications’ functional requirements using differential predictive learning. The OSF-based predictive learning performance monitoring is used to detect early faults, improve productivity, minimize downtime, and reduce energy costs. This helps align the distribution and consumption factors for different appliances to identify the fluctuating threats through fore-hand predictions. The entire process is administered using a centralized cybersecurity system coupled with the EMS. The proposed framework's performance is verified using the metrics energy efficiency, distribution interruption, failures, and detection rate. Cybersecurity. Energy distribution.

Risk and protective factors for intuitive and rational judgment of cybersecurity risks in a large sample of K-12 students and teachers. K-12 students and teachers are a vulnerable population for cybersecurity risks. Identifying both risk factors and protective factors associated with intuitive and rational judgment of cybersecurity risks would help them develop strategies to tackle cyber risks. A total of 2703 K-12 students and teachers from 45 GenCyber Summer Camps participated in the survey study at the beginning of the camps, and a total of 1021 K-12 students and teachers participated in the follow-up survey at the end of the camps. The Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire was developed and administered to assess intuitive and rational judgments of cybersecurity risks. Two major findings of the study include: (1) three significant risk factors associated with both intuitive and rational cybersecurity judgment were Age Group, Region, and Prior GenCyber Camp Experience. That is, younger students, the campers from the West region, and participants attending the camps before tended to have a lower level of cybersecurity judgment. and (2) two significant protective factors were Cyber Use Length and Current GenCyber Camp Experience, i.e., the experiences of both using computers, Internet, cellphones and participating in the current camps having significant advantages in judging cybersecurity risks intuitively and rationally. Thus, it is critical to use both the push strategy to minimize the risk factors and the pull strategy to maximize the protective factors. It is concluded with a summary of limitations and future studies, i.e., replicating the findings in regular K-12 schools, examining more risk and protective factors, conducting longitudinal studies, and studying underlying mechanisms.

A Systematic Risk Assessment Framework of Automotive Cybersecurity. The increasingly intelligent and connected vehicles have brought many unprecedented automotive cybersecurity threats, which may cause privacy breaches, personal injuries, and even national security issues. Before providing effective security solutions, a comprehensive risk assessment of the automotive cybersecurity must be carried out. A systematic cybersecurity risk assessment framework for automobiles is proposed in this study. It consists of an assessment process and systematic assessment methods considering the changes of threat environment, evaluation target, and available information in vehicle lifecycle. In the process of risk identification and risk analysis, the impact level and attack feasibility level are assessed based on the STRIDE model and attack tree method. An automotive cybersecurity risk matrix using a global rating algorithm is then constructed to create a quantitative risk metric. Finally, the applicability and feasibility of the proposed risk assessment framework are demonstrated through a use case, and the results prove that the proposed framework is effective. The proposed assessment framework helps to systematically derive automotive cybersecurity requirements. Assessment process. Attack tree. Cybersecurity. Risk matrix. Threat analysis.

Cyber Place Management and Crime Prevention: The Effectiveness of Cybersecurity Awareness Training Against Phishing Attacks. Criminologists and crime prevention practitioners recognize the importance of geographical places to crime activities and the role that place managers might play in effectively preventing crime. Indeed, over the past several decades, a large body of work has highlighted the tendency for crime to concentrate across an assortment of geographic areas, where place management tends to be absent or weak. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of research evaluating place management strategies and cybercrime within the virtual domain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of place management techniques on reducing cybercrime incidents in an online setting. Using data derived from the information technology division of a large urban research university in the United States, this study evaluated the impact of an anti-phishing training program delivered to employees that sought to increase awareness and understanding of methods to better protect their virtual places from cybercrimes. Findings are discussed within the context of the broader crime and place literature. cyber place management. cybersecurity awareness. information security officials. online training. phishing attacks. 
Real-time analytics, incident response process agility and enterprise cybersecurity performance: A contingent resource-based analysis. Emerging paradigms of attack challenge enterprise cybersecurity with sophisticated custom-built tools, unpredictable patterns of exploitation, and an increasing ability to adapt to cyber defenses. As a result, organizations continue to experience incidents and suffer losses. The responsibility to respond to cybersecurity incidents lies with the incident response (IR) function. We argue that (1) organizations must develop ‘agility’ in their IR process to respond swiftly and efficiently to sophisticated and potent cyber threats, and (2) Real-time analytics (RTA) gives organizations a unique opportunity to drive their IR process in an agile manner by detecting cybersecurity incidents quickly and responding to them proactively. To better understand how organizations can use RTA to enable IR agility, we analyzed in-depth data from twenty expert interviews using a contingent resource-based view. The results informed a framework explaining how organizations enable agile characteristics (swiftness, flexibility, and innovation) in the IR process using the key features of the RTA capability (complex event processing, decision automation, and on-demand and continuous data analysis) to detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents as-they-occur which, in turn, improves their overall enterprise cybersecurity performance.

Exploring the value of non-technical knowledge, skills, and abilities (Ksas) to cybersecurity hiring managers. Industry's demand for cybersecurity workers with non-technical knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that complement technical prowess is not new. The purpose of this study was to connect with cybersecurity practitioners to determine which non-technical KSAs should be emphasized by educators to help meet workforce demands. This research applies a novel application of the Ground Truth Expertise Development Model (GTEDM) for exploring suitable non-technical and particularly soft KSAs necessary for cybersecurity professional development programs. This study focused on the definition and competency determination step and provided foundational KSA prioritization for further research. The field overwhelmingly agreed that non-technical skills were essential to a cybersecurity worker's success. The qualitative process produced three themes as non-technical KSA areas of the most significant import to the cybersecurity field. These KSA themes required included critically using information, communications skills, and collaboration to pursue customer/client success. The findings produce a more comprehensive list of hard, soft, and mixed non-technical skills that will benefit the public, private, and academic sector organizations as they develop cybersecurity curricula.

A Deep Learning Approach in Optical Inspection to Detect Hidden Hardware Trojans and Secure Cybersecurity in Electronics Manufacturing Supply Chains. Deep learning methods have been extensively studied and have been proven to be very useful in multiple fields of technology. This paper presents a deep learning approach to optically detect hidden hardware trojans in the manufacturing and assembly phase of printed circuit boards to secure electronic supply chains. Trojans can serve as backdoors of accessing on chip data, can potentially alter functioning and in some cases may even deny intended service of the chip. Apart from consumer electronics, printed circuit boards are used in mission critical applications like military and space equipment. Security compromise or data theft can have severe impact and thus demand research attention. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can be implemented in a manufacturing environment with limited training data. It can also provide better coverage in detection of hardware trojans over traditional methods. Image recognition algorithms need to have deeper penetration inside the training layers for recognizing physical variations of image patches. However, traditional network architectures often face vanishing gradient problem when the network layers are added. This hampers the overall accuracy of the network. To solve this a Residual network with multiple layers is used in this article. The ResNet34 algorithm can identify manufacturing tolerances and can differentiate between a manufacturing defect and a hardware trojan. The ResNet operates on the fundamental principle of learning from the residual of the output of preceding layer. In the degradation issue, it is observed that, a shallower network performs better than deeper network. However, this is with the downside of lower accuracy. Thus, a skip connection is made to provide an alternative path for the gradient to skip forward the training of few layers and add in multiple repeating blocks to achieve higher accuracy and lower training times. Implementation of this method can bolster automated optical inspection setup used to detect manufacturing variances on a printed circuit board. The results show a 98.5% accuracy in optically detecting trojans by this method and can help cut down redundancy of physically testing each board. The research results also provide a new consideration of hardware trojan benchmarking and its effect on optical detection. artificial intelligence. deep learning. hardware cybersecurity. hardware trojan. optical inspection. printed circuit boards manufacturing.

Cybersecurity implementation success factors in smart city. Cybersecurity has proven to be a prominent topic in business and government developments. Although most Smart City organizations have cybersecurity strategies in place, they still face challenges in implementing them. The implementation and adoption of appropriate cybersecurity are challenging and knowledge-intensive and require the participation and support of policymakers and IT units. However, although awareness of critical success factors (CSF) for cybersecurity implementation is very beneficial in avoiding failure in Smart City projects, this area has rarely been researched, especially with a focus on Smart City development. Therefore, the contribution of this paper to research and practice is the identification of critical factors that influence the successful implementation of cybersecurity in smart cities. This study was carried out through an interview study with officials and staff in the Jakarta Smart City environment. As a result, we have 15 keys critical factor that has a practical implementation and could include in the model of cybersecurity in smart cities. Critical Success Factors. Cybersecurity.

Is it possible to change the cyber security behaviours of employees? Barriers and promoters. The increase in cyber attacks cause individuals and businesses to face financial loss and reputation damage. Most cyber security studies ignore human factor and focus only on technological measures although the cyber security behaviors of employees are vital for the organisations. This paper aims to explore and discuss the role of employees in cyber security. In-depth interviews with eight cyber security experts were conducted through semi-structured, open-ended interviews. This study gives perspectives regarding the cyber security behaviors of employees, the barriers and promoters of secure behaviors in cyberspace. The findings mainly stem reasons of unsecure behaviors and solutions for them, and provide implications to companies for effective training and recommendations to adopt secure behaviors in the companies.

Cyber security for multi-station integrated smart energy stations: Architecture and solutions. Multi-station integration is motivated by the requirements of distributed energies inter-connection and improvements in the efficiency of energy systems. Due to the diversity of communication services and the complexity of data exchanges between in-of-station and out-of-station, multi-station integrated systems have high security requirements. However, issues related to cyber security for multi-station integrated systems are seldom explored. Hence, this paper designs the secondary system architecture and proposes cyber security protection solutions for smart energy stations (SESt) that integrate the substation, photovoltaic station, energy storage station, electric vehicle charging station, and data center station. Firstly, the composition of SESt and functions of each substation are presented, a layered architecture of SESt is designed, and data exchanges of SESt are analyzed. Then, the cyber security threats and requirements of SESt are illustrated. Moreover, the cyber security protection principle and a cyber security protection system for SESt are proposed. On this basis, a security zoning and isolation scheme for SESt is designed. Finally, a traffic isolation scheme based on virtual local area networks (VLANs), a real-time guarantee scheme for communications based on service priority, and an enhancing cyber security scheme based on improved IEC 62351 are proposed for SESt. Cyber security.

Towards a machine learning based situational awareness framework for cybersecurity: An SDN implementation. The ever-increasing number of internet-connected devices, along with the continuous evolution of cyber-attacks, in terms of volume and ingenuity, has led to a widened cyber-threat landscape, rendering infrastructures prone to malicious attacks. Towards addressing systems’ vulnerabilities and alleviating the impact of these threats, this paper presents a machine learning based situational awareness framework that detects existing and newly introduced network-enabled entities, utilizing the real-time awareness feature provided by the SDN paradigm, assesses them against known vulnerabilities, and assigns them to a connectivity-appropriate network slice. The assessed entities are continuously monitored by an ML-based IDS, which is trained with an enhanced dataset. Our endeavor aims to demonstrate that a neural network, trained with heterogeneous data stemming from the operational environment (common vulnerability enumeration IDs that correlate attacks with existing vulnerabilities), can achieve more accurate prediction rates than a conventional one, thus addressing some aspects of the situational awareness paradigm. The proposed framework was evaluated within a real-life environment and the results revealed an increase of more than 4% in the overall prediction accuracy. Intrusion detection systems.

Understanding iiot cybersecurity issues. Applying cybersecurity principles to the built environment often focuses on securing user access to building automation systems, an obvious area of concern. Similar application can secure the interface that connects equipment to the internet to facilitate machine-to-machine communication-often referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).1 A cursory knowledge of this subject is important to give owners, engineers and technicians a user-level understanding of cybersecurity issues. After all, the development efforts mentioned in this column are being funded directly or indirectly by all of us. In a way, this means we are also funding cyber criminals.

The local government’s position in the polish cybersecurity system. This article discusses the local government’s position in the national cybersecurity system. It refers to the status of the local government administration in cyberspace, including the duties and responsibilities ensuring cybersecurity. In Poland, the local government is considered the basic form of decentralisation of public power, as a result of which the legislator has entrusted it with a significant portion of public duties. The list of such duties also encompasses telecommunication responsibilities carried out in cyberspace. In general practice, cyberspace is also used to carry out other responsibilities. The local government has the most extensive knowledge on the matters concerning a given (local or regional) community, referring also to cybersecurity. however, the legislator has not awarded this entity with any special status. It is merely one of the many entities forming the national cybersecurity system. Inter alia, the local government is obliged to carry out a range of activities aimed at incident detection, incident cause analysis, and corrective actions. It is also expected to ensure the appropriate incident management which includes, inter alia, incident handling and eliminating incident causes. Confidential information. Cybersecurity.

Some information geometric aspects of cyber security by face recognition. Secure user access to devices and datasets is widely enabled by fingerprint or face recogni-tion. Organization of the necessarily large secure digital object datasets, with objects having content that may consist of images, text, video or audio, involves efficient classification and feature retrieval processing. This usually will require multidimensional methods applicable to data that is represented through a family of probability distributions. Then information geometry is an appropriate context in which to provide for such analytic work, whether with maximum likelihood fitted distributions or empirical frequency distributions. The important provision is of a natural geometric measure structure on families of probability distributions by representing them as Riemannian manifolds. Then the distributions are points lying in this geometrical manifold, different features can be identified and dissimilarities computed, so that neighbourhoods of objects nearby a given example object can be constructed. This can reveal clustering and projections onto smaller eigen-subspaces which can make comparisons easier to interpret. Geodesic distances can be used as a natural dissimilarity metric applied over data described by probability distributions. Exploring this property, we propose a new face recognition method which scores dissimilarities between face images by multiplying geodesic distance approximations between 3-variate RGB Gaussians representative of colour face images, and also obtaining joint probabilities. The experimental results show that this new method is more successful in recognition rates than published comparative state-of-the-art methods. Classification. Cyber security. Entropy.

Cyber security: what are we talking about?. The term ‘cyber security’ is increasingly commonplace in everyday life, and is something that users of all ages will encounter in some form. However, there are varying interpretations about what it actually means, and because of this, people have similarly varying assumptions about the extent to which it applies to them or might affect them. 
Complex system governance as a foundation for enhancing the cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems. This article investigates the possible benefits of complex system governance (CSG) as a foundation for enhancing cybersecurity in critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS are intrinsically linked to cyberspace and vulnerable to a wide range of risks stemming from physical and cyber threats. There remains a lack of robust frameworks for addressing the issue of cybersecurity for CPS at the metasystem level. In response, the authors suggest CSG as an organizing construct capable of providing a greater degree of cohesion and as a means to provide for design, execution, and evolution of ‘metasystemic’ functions necessary to provide for communication, control, and coordination, and integration is critical to the cybersecurity of CPS. In this article, CSG is introduced as a potential construct for enhancing cybersecurity in CPS. A hypothetical case study application is then provided to illustrate the potential for this research. Finally, the authors offer conclusions and suggest future research. Copyright . Case study. Complex system governance. Cyber-physical systems. Management cybernetics. Metasystem function. Power grid.

A sociotechnical systems analysis of knowledge management for cybersecurity. Knowledge management (KM) is a tool to tackle cybersecurity issues, provided it emphasizes on the interrelated social, organizational, and technological factors involved in cybersecurity. This paper proposes a sociotechnical systems analysis framework of KM systems for cybersecurity. Specifically, it applies a sociotechnical systems approach to investigation of constructs of KM systems for cybersecurity and identifies five major constructs of KM systems for cybersecurity: Roles of KM in cybersecurity, organizational framework of KM for cybersecurity, cybersecurity analytics process, tools of KM for cybersecurity, and system architecture of KM for cybersecurity. The five constructs in the proposed sociotechnical systems analysis framework are analyzed. The paper makes contribution to the growing information systems literature by presenting a special case of sociotechnical systems analysis. The sociotechnical systems analysis framework provides guidelines for the development of KM systems for cybersecurity in organizations. Cybersecurity. Knowledge Management. Sociotechnical Systems.

Towards Next-Generation Cybersecurity with Graph AI. Cybersecurity professionals are inundated with large amounts of data, and require intelligent algorithms capable of distinguishing vulnerable from patched, normal from anomalous, and malicious from benign. Unfortunately, not all machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are created equal, and in this position paper we posit that a new breed of ML, specifically graph-based machine learning (Graph AI), is poised to make a significant impact in this domain. We will discuss the primary differentiators between traditional ML and graph ML, and provide reasons and justifications for why the latter is well-suited to many aspects of cybersecurity. We will present several example applications and result of graph ML in cybersecurity, followed by a discussion of the challenges that lie ahead. 
Get a red-hot poker and open up my eyes, it's so boring1: Employee perceptions of cybersecurity training. Organisations and security professionals design Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) programs to improve cybersecurity behaviour, but they are often poorly received by employees. To understand employee negative perceptions of SETA programs, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 Australian employees regarding their experiences with both SETA programs and non-cybersecurity related workplace training. As expected, employees had a generally poor view of SETA programs. They reported that the same factors that are important for effective non-cybersecurity training are also important for SETA programs, such as management role modelling and well-designed workplace systems. However, the level of importance of these factors differed across the two contexts. For example, employees indicated that the misbehaviour of their colleagues is a more important factor for their appraisal of a SETA program than it is for a non-cybersecurity workplace training program. Our results suggest that employee perceptions of SETA programs relate to their previously held beliefs about cybersecurity threats, the content and delivery of the training program, the behaviour of others around them, and features of their organisation. From an applied perspective, these findings can explain why employees often do not engage with cybersecurity training material, and how their current beliefs can influence their receptivity for future training. 
Implementing Cybersecurity Best Practices for Electrical Infrastructure in a Refinery: A Case Study. Cybersecurity is quickly becoming one of the most important and potentially impactful risks to a process or refining facility. Cybersecurity solutions for electrical infrastructure can be challenging to implement because of the large number of devices that utilize a single set of passwords. The potential solutions to mitigate these risks can be expensive, inefficient, and time consuming to maintain. This article describes a case study of developing and implementing cybersecurity best practices for electrical infrastructure at a refining facility using a low-cost and low-maintenance approach. The design approach for this case study employs a centralized solution to implement role-based user access control, automated device password management, and a centralized data aggregation and human-machine interface (HMI) platform. The development of the cybersecurity best practices, design and implementation of the automation and cybersecurity platform, operations and maintenance, and lessons learned are discussed. 
Worm computing: A blockchain-based resource sharing and cybersecurity framework. Recently, the rapid growth of network resources and the cybersecurity issues become more and more rigorous due to the rapid progress of Internet of Things (IoTs). How to integrate the network resources and enhance the defense capabilities effectively is an urgent problem. In this paper, inspired by the spread of friendly worms in the network, we put forward a novel concept of worm computing which is a decentralized computing platform. The worm computing model is able to integrate the useful information for resource sharing and cooperative defense, which can achieve the resource utilization refreshing, computing capacity improvement and network security enhancement. We use a blockchain platform to build a fundamental decentralization system and store collaborative data by delivering a private chain, which solves the problem of data sharing and trust computing in the traditional collaboration model by providing decentralized and credible services to ensure the unchangeable modification of transactions. We conduct experiments on resource utilization and collaborative defense of malicious URLs and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed worm computing model in improving resource utilization and network security.

Idea entrepreneurs: The United Nations Open-Ended Working Group & cybersecurity. The United Nations OEWG (Open Ended Working Group) focused on cybersecurity provides the context for an examination of idea entrepreneurship regarding the role of nonstate actors and the concepts of human rights, gender and sustainable development against the backdrop of a global pandemic and increasing cybersecurity challenges. Crafting a cross-disciplinary conceptual framework based upon a review of relevant literatures, this study uses archival and content analysis to highlight those organizations serving as idea entrepreneurs and those contesting such ideas. Findings include the presence of key divides among idea entrepreneur organizations (including among nation-state organizations themselves) as well as key linkages among a ‘galaxy’ or interconnection of ideas forged with potential to bridge such divides. Additionally, mention of the pandemic emerges as a factor catalyzing idea entrepreneurship with a focus on critical infrastructures. Cybersecurity. Gender. Human rights. Idea diffusion.

Cybersecurity, safety and robots: Strengthening the link between cybersecurity and safety in the context of care robots. This paper addresses the interplay between robots, cybersecurity, and safety from a European legal perspective, a topic under-explored by current technical and legal literature. The legal framework, together with technical standards, is a necessary parameter for the production and deployment of robots. However, European law does not regulate robots as such, and there exist multiple and overlapping legal requirements focusing on specific contexts, such as product safety and medical devices. Besides, the recently enacted European Cybersecurity Act establishes a cybersecurity certification framework, which could be used to define cybersecurity requirements for robots, although concrete cyber-physical implementation requirements are not yet prescribed. In this article, we illustrate cybersecurity challenges and their subsequent safety implications with the concrete example of care robots. These robots interact in close, direct contact with children, elderly, and persons with disabilities, and a malfunctioning or cybersecurity threat may affect the health and well-being of these people. Moreover, care robots may process vast amounts of data, including health and behavioral data, which are especially sensitive in the healthcare domain. Security vulnerabilities in robots thus raise significant concerns, not only for manufacturers and programmers, but also for those who interact with them, especially in sensitive applications such as healthcare. While the latest European policymaking efforts on robot regulation acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity, many details, and their impact on user safety have not yet been addressed in depth. Our contribution aims to answer the question whether the current European legal framework is prepared to address cyber and physical risks from care robots and ensure safe human–robot interactions in such a sensitive context. Cybersecurity and physical product safety legal requirements are governed separately in a dual regulatory framework, presenting a challenge in governing uniformly and adequately cyber-physical systems such as care robots. We conceptualize and discuss the challenges of regulating cyber-physical systems’ security with the current dual framework, particularly the lack of mandatory certifications. We conclude that policymakers need to consider cybersecurity as an indissociable aspect of safety to ensure robots are truly safe to use. Connected products. Cybersecurity. GDPR. Healthcare.

Cybersecurity of Smart Home Systems: Sensor Identity Protection. Smart home systems are designed as platforms for connecting sensors, home appliances, and devices to exchange data and, ultimately, to provide useful services to home residents. However, such systems are vulnerable to Cybersecurity attacks that can affect the reliability and integrity of the delivered services. Sensors, planted at smart homes or equipped with smart appliances, are highly exposed to identity theft. Intruders can recognize through the understanding of the exchanged data, their locations, or knowing their associated services. Such information might make the home resident vulnerable to life attacks. Therefore, protecting sensors identities in smart home systems is of high interest in this domain. This paper introduces a novel technique that protects sensors’ identity from being recognized through cordless communication environments. Our proposed approach utilizes a three-phase technique that controls a synchronized queue among connected sensors and keeps their identity hidden from outsiders. The proposed approach preserves the linearity of time that is required to manage the protection of the home network. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on four different smart homes datasets. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to measure how our proposed approach is affected by different environmental variables. The results indicated that the proposed approach provides a significant performance in protecting sensors identities in smart home area networks. Furthermore, during the sensitivity analysis, we found that our proposed technique’s performance is highly affected by the threshold value that defines each sensor’s time interval. Cyber-attacks.

Quantum-Inspired Blockchain-Based Cybersecurity: Securing Smart Edge Utilities in IoT-Based Smart Cities. Blockchain plays a vital task in cybersecurity. With the exerted efforts for realising large-scale quantum computers, most current cryptographic mechanisms may be hacked. Accordingly, we need a quantum tool utilised for designing blockchain frameworks to have the ability to be executed in the level of digital computers and resist the probable attacks from both digital and quantum computers. Quantum walks may be utilised as a quantum-inspired model for designing new cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a new authentication and encryption protocol based on quantum-inspired quantum walks (QIQW). The proposed protocol is utilized to build a blockchain framework for secure data transmission among IoT devices. Instead of using classical cryptographic hash functions, quantum hash functions based on QIQW are employed for linking blocks of the chain. The main advantages of the presented framework are helping IoT nodes to effectively share their data with other nodes and full control of their records. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed protocol can defend against message attack and impersonation attacks, thus ensuring secure transmission of data among IoT devices. Authentication.

Increasing Cybersecurity Career Interest through Playable Case Studies. In this paper we introduce an approach to cybersecurity education and helping students develop professional understanding in the form of a Playable Case Study (PCS), a form of educational simulation that draws on affordances of the broader educational simulation genre, case study instruction, and educational Alternate Reality Games (or ARGs). A PCS is an interactive simulation that allows students to play through an authentic scenario (case study) as a member of a professional team. We report our findings over a multi-year study of a PCS called Cybermatics, with data from 111 students from two different U.S. universities who interacted with the PCS. Cybermatics increased student understanding about certain key aspects of professional cybersecurity work, improved their confidence in being able to successfully apply certain skills associated with cybersecurity, and increased about half of the students’ interest in pursuing a cybersecurity career. Students also reported a number of reasons why their perceptions changed in these areas (both positive and negative). We also discuss design tensions we experienced in our process that might be encountered by others when creating simulations like a PCS, as they attempt to balance the authenticity of designed learning experiences while also sufficiently scaffolding them for newcomers who have little background in a discipline.

Understanding Cybersecurity Threat Trends Through Dynamic Topic Modeling. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase and are impacting almost all aspects of modern life. Being aware of how vulnerabilities and their exploits are changing gives helpful insights into combating new threats. Applying dynamic topic modeling to a time-stamped cybersecurity document collection shows how the significance and details of concepts found in them are evolving. We correlate two different temporal corpora, one with reports about specific exploits and the other with research-oriented papers on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. We represent the documents, concepts, and dynamic topic modeling data in a semantic knowledge graph to support integration, inference, and discovery. A critical insight into discovering knowledge through topic modeling is seeding the knowledge graph with domain concepts to guide the modeling process. We use Wikipedia concepts to provide a basis for performing concept phrase extraction and show how using those phrases improves the quality of the topic models. Researchers can query the resulting knowledge graph to reveal important relations and trends. This work is novel because it uses topics as a bridge to relate documents across corpora over time. cybersecurity. cyberthreat information. dynamic topic modeling. knowledge graph. topic modeling. 
ExSol: Collaboratively assessing cybersecurity risks for protecting energy delivery systems. No longer just prophesied about, cyber-attacks to Energy Delivery Systems (EDS) (e.g., the power grid, gas and oil industries) are now very real dangers that result in non-trivial economical losses and inconveniences to modern societies. In such a context, risk analysis has been proposed as a valuable way to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, threats, and attack vectors. However, performing risk analysis for EDS is difficult due to their innate structural diversity and interdependencies, along with an always-increasing threatscape. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology to evaluate the current system state, identify vulnerabilities, and qualify risk at multiple granularities in a collaborative manner among different actors in the context of EDS. With this in mind, this article presents ExSol, a collaborative, real-time, risk assessment ecosystem that features an approach for modeling real-life EDS infrastructures, an ontology traversal technique that retrieves well-defined security requirements from well-reputed documents on cyber-protection for EDS infrastructures, as well as a methodology for calculating risk for a single asset and for an entire system. Moreover, we also provide experimental evidence involving a series of attack scenarios in both simulated and real-world EDS environments, which ultimately encourage the adoption of ExSol in practice. energy delivery systems.

E-commerce calls for cyber-security and sustainability: How european citizens look for a trusted online environment. The pandemic has changed the citizens’ behavior, inducing them to avoid any real contact. This has given an incredible impulse to e-commerce. however, the complexity of the topic has not yet been adequately explored in the literature. To fill this gap, this study has a twofold purpose: (1) to investigate how European countries comparatively perform in e-commerce, and (2) to describe what are the most important challenges for the further expansion of e-commerce. To this end, we adopted a hybrid methodology based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and a Likert scale survey. The first method allows to us rank the e-commerce performance of different European countries, while the second one looks at the problems and barriers that characterize online shopping. The results of the study show that European countries have different sensitivities to the issue of cyber-security, and among them it is possible to identify three groups with different levels of attention to the critical issues of e-commerce. The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark belong to the group of countries most responsive to e-commerce. This request is part of a broader framework of transition toward sustainable development, i.e., a reliable digital environment where citizens and businesses can exercise their rights and freedoms in complete security. Finally, from a theoretical perspective, this paper adds a new baseline to the literature on the state of the art of e-commerce in Europe that addresses the effects of the pandemic. From a managerial point of view, decision makers can find in the results of this analysis a support for the setting of business strategies for the expansion of firms in certain markets and guidance for public authorities when defining regulatory policies for e-commerce.

Covid-19 and beyond: Employee perceptions of the efficiency of teleworking and its cybersecurity implications. The main idea of this research is to examine how teleworking has affected employee perceptions of organizational efficiency and cybersecurity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research is based on an analytical and empirical approach. The starting point of the research is a critical and comprehensive analysis of the relevant literature regarding the efficiency of organizations due to teleworking, digital information security, and cyber risk management. The quantitative approach is based on designing a structural equation model (SEM) on a sample of 1101 respondents from the category of employees in Montenegro. Within the model, we examine simultaneously the impact of their perceptions on the risks of teleworking, changes in cyber-attacks during teleworking, organizations’ capacity to respond to cyber-attacks, key challenges in achieving an adequate response to cyber-attacks, as well as perceptions of key challenges related to cybersecurity. The empirical aspects of our study involve constructing latent variables that correspond to different elements of employee perception. namely, their perception of organizational efficiency and the extent to which the digital information security of their organizations has been threatened during teleworking during the pandemic.

Cyber Security Issues in Implementing Shipping Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) In Straits of Malacca and Singapore. Owing to the density of the traffic in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore (SOMS), the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) did succeed to implement a governance principle between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, the three surrounding nations around SOMS), but there still remained several navigational challenges and threats to maritime such as cybersecurity issues, navigation theft and other types of cybercrimes. This study employed an explorative research design, and made use of documentation research method for data collection. This study unearthed several layers of the cyber and information security domain known as maritime cybersecurity and explored various types of cyber security issues that might prevent the smooth functioning of Traffic Separation Schemes and other shipping communication networks in the SOMS region. This study fulfils the long felt need of examining the existing provisions of regulatory frameworks and the vulnerabilities of e-navigation in the TSS and assessing the cyber security of shipping activities in the Malacca straits. While investigating the landscape of cyber threats amidst actual incidents in the maritime sector, this study forewarns the shipping companies against cyber risks and threats. It also recommends how cybersecurity could be improved in the maritime sector over time, and hopefully it might inspire further research work. Cyber risk. Cyber security. E-navigation. Imo.

THE CYBERSECURITY OF HEALTHCARE The Case of the Benešov Hospital Hit by Ryuk Ransomware, and Lessons Learned. This article is dealing mainly with cybersecurity of healthcare with a special emphasis on the Benešov hospital (Czech Republic), which was hit by the Ryuk ransomware virus. The case shows that even a well-managed middle-size hospital with a relatively good level of cybersecurity might be significantly hit by the attack. The article first explores the general context of cybersecurity of healthcare with reference to the forms of cyber-attacks involving ransomware and then explores the case of the Benešov hospital (Hospital of Rudolf and Stefanie). The main aim of this article is to derive lessons learned from the case, which might be well used for the management of further incidents of similar nature, which is increasingly important at the times of fight with COVID-19 infection creating new pressure on the system.

Shaping the ground for bilateral cybersecurity negotiations. Cyber issues are important for the bilateral relationship between China and the United States, but there are serious obstacles to reaching agreement on cybersecurity. Meaningful negotiation is not possible in the near term, given China’s disinterest in compromise, except on its own terms, and the unfavorable U.S. position inherited by the Biden Administration. China is unlikely to make concessions and the U.S. is unlikely to accept at face value any concession China might offer to make. Progress is also hampered by the outdated concepts used in bilateral cybersecurity discussions, such as stability, escalation, or deterrence. These terms are inherited from the Cold War and no longer provide a useful conceptual framework or lexicon. The most pressing issues are cyber espionage and political interference using cyber means. The prospects for bilateral agreement on these topics are limited. Both the U.S. and China lack incentives to reach agreement. Perhaps, if there is a time in the future when the U.S. and China both perceived increased risks from continued cyber conflict, that would create the incentives needed to negotiate, but there is little incentive for agreement now.

Classifying the contents of cybersecurity risk disclosure through textual analysis and factor analysis. Cybersecurity has garnered much attention due to the increasing frequency and cost of cybersecurity incidents and has become a significant concern for organizations and governments. Regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have also shown an interest in cybersecurity and the quality of cybersecurity risk disclosures. This paper examines the informativeness of cybersecurity risk disclosures when cybersecurity incidents or related internal control weaknesses are reported. In particular, we propose a quantitative methodology, which is a combination of textual analysis and factor analysis, for classifying cybersecurity risk disclosures into nine factors. Our results show different disclosing patterns among firms depending on whether they had cybersecurity incidents and internal control weaknesses. Further, our analysis indicates that firms disclose control-related factors to mediate the negative effect of disclosing vulnerability-related factors. This study provides various stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and researchers, with insight into the informativeness of cybersecurity risk disclosures. Cybersecurity. Factor analysis.

Grid cyber security: secure by design, continuous threat monitoring, effective incident response and board oversight. Grids are possibly the highest expression of engineering serving society. From the aqueducts created in the sixth century BCE to the modern era birth of gas utilities in the 1820s, followed by electricity generation and distribution grids in the 1880s and the computer information-sharing age kicking off in the 1960s, we have been creating distribution infrastructure. Grids are possibly the highest expression of engineering serving society. We have lots of infrastructure, spanning generations of engineering and technology, still in service. This presents a problem as there are many who see these grids as vulnerable and high-value targets. Dale Geach of Siemens UK examines where the weaknesses lie and how they have already been exploited. As grid operators seek the huge benefits of modernising grid operations, it's important that they adopt a secure-by-design network with continuous threat detection and watertight response plans. 
Grid cyber-security strategy in an attacker-defender model†. The progression of cyber-attacks on the cyber-physical system is analyzed by the Proba-bilistic, Learning Attacker, and Dynamic Defender (PLADD) model. Although our research does apply to all cyber-physical systems, we focus on power grid infrastructure. The PLADD model evaluates the effectiveness of moving target defense (MTD) techniques. We consider the power grid attack scenarios in the AND configurations and OR configurations. In addition, we consider, for the first time ever, power grid attack scenarios involving both AND configurations and OR configurations simultaneously. Cyber-security managers can use the strategy introduced in this manuscript to optimize their defense strategies. Specifically, our research provides insight into when to reset access controls (such as passwords, internet protocol addresses, and session keys), to minimize the probability of a successful attack. Our mathematical proof for the OR configuration of multiple PLADD games shows that it is best if all access controls are reset simultaneously. For the AND configuration, our mathematical proof shows that it is best (in terms of minimizing the attacker’s average probability of success) that the resets are equally spaced apart. We introduce a novel concept called hierarchical parallel PLADD system to cover additional attack scenarios that require combinations of AND and OR configurations. Attack graph.

Study on cyber-security for IoT edge utilizing pattern match accelerator. A malware detection algorithm that can be embedded in IoT edge computing is proposed in this study and validated using an emulator. This algorithm, with a pattern match accelerator, reduces the computing cost while maintaining a relatively high detection accuracy. For autonomous driving, complicated IoT edge computing must have a huge amount of embedded program codes. In such a situation, the invasion of malware can lead to compromised cybersecurity. In this study, a pattern match accelerator is implemented for such issues, thereby offering IoT edge computing that detects malware automatically. Edge computing is designed to apply simply structural level analysis algorithms using HLAC mask pattern. We developed a pseudo-emulator system environment and conducted performance confirmation of the proposed technique using 641 chosen samples from six types of malware families. The algorithm's efficiencies demonstrated an identification performance of approximately 80%. In comparison to characteristic extraction using AI, the computing cost was reduced and these processes enable edge computing with high cybersecurity features. cybersecurity.

Assessing the Moderating Effect of Security Technologies on Employees Compliance with Cybersecurity Control Procedures. The increase in cybersecurity threats and the challenges for organisations to protect their information technology assets has made adherence to organisational security control processes and procedures a critical issue that needs to be adequately addressed. Drawing insight from organisational theory literature, we develop a multi-theory model, combining the elements of the theory of planned behaviour, competing value framework, and technology - organisational and environmental theory to examine how the organisational mechanisms interact with espoused cultural values and employee cognitive belief to influence cybersecurity control procedures. Using a structured questionnaire, we deployed structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the survey data obtained from public sector information technology organisations in Nigeria to test the hypothesis on the relationship of socio-organisational mechanisms and techno-cultural factors with other key determinants of employee security behaviour. The results showed that knowledge of cybersecurity and employee cognitive belief significantly influence the employees' intentions to comply with organisational cybersecurity control mechanisms. The research further noted that the influence of organisational elements such as leadership on employee security behaviour is mediated by espoused cultural values while the impact of employee cognitive belief is moderated by security technologies. For effective cybersecurity compliance, leaders and policymakers are therefore to promote organisational security initiatives that ensure incorporation of cybersecurity principles and practices into job descriptions, routines, and processes. This study contributes to behavioural security research by highlighting the critical role of leadership and cultural values in fostering organisational adherence to prescribed security control mechanisms. compliance.

Overview and improvement of procedures and practices of electricity transmission system operators in south east europe to mitigate cybersecurity threats. The implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) in power systems increases the risks of cybersecurity threats, requiring protection measures that should reflect the multi-actor environment of the contemporary power systems. This paper provides a critical assessment of the cybersecurity practices of the transmission system operators (TSOs) from South East Europe (SEE) and the implementation of obligations for TSOs emerging from the complex set of cybersecurity and electricity legislation. The analyses of TSO cybersecurity practices are based on a survey conducted with the TSOs from SEE and show there is a lack of consistent cybersecurity policy at the TSO level. These analyses demonstrate that the differences between TSOs from the SEE region are not very significant with regards to implementation of technical protection and defense measures for critical infrastructures (CIs) and assets. The comprehensive analyses of electricity and cybersecurity legislation uncover the obligations of TSOs emerging from legislation and relate them to current TSO cybersecurity practices, confirming the necessity to boost existing practices. Considering the analyzed legislation and implemented practices, this paper presents a proposal for a cybersecurity framework for TSOs that should improve their organizational and operational response to the evolving cybersecurity challenges.

Qualitative risk assessment of cybersecurity and development of vulnerability enhancement plans in consideration of digitalized ship. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) published the Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management in 2017 to strengthen cybersecurity in consideration of digitalized ships. As part of these guidelines, the IMO recommends that each flag state should integrate and manage matters regarding cyber risk in the ship safety management system (SMS) according to the International Safety Management Code (ISM Code) before the first annual verification that takes place on or after 1 January 2021. The purpose of this paper is to identify cybersecurity risk components in the maritime sector that should be managed by the SMS in 2021 and to derive priorities for vulnerability improvement plans through itemized risk assessment. To this end, qualitative risk assessment (RA) was carried out for administrative, technical, and physical security risk components based on industry and international standards, which were additionally presented in the IMO guidelines. Based on the risk matrix from the RA analysis results, a survey on improving cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the maritime sector was conducted, and the analytic hierarchy process was used to analyze the results and derive improvement plan priority measures.

Cybersecurity considerations for grid-connected batteries with hardware demonstrations. The share of renewable and distributed energy resources (DERs), like wind turbines, solar photovoltaics and grid-connected batteries, interconnected to the electric grid is rapidly increasing due to reduced costs, rising efficiency, and regulatory requirements aimed at incentivizing a lower-carbon electricity system. These distributed energy resources differ from traditional generation in many ways including the use of many smaller devices connected primarily (but not exclusively) to the distribution network, rather than few larger devices connected to the transmission network. DERs being installed today often include modern communication hardware like cellular modems and WiFi connectivity and, in addition, the inverters used to connect these resources to the grid are gaining increasingly complex capabilities, like providing voltage and frequency support or supporting microgrids. To perform these new functions safely, communications to the device and more complex controls are required. The distributed nature of DER devices combined with their network connectivity and complex controls interfaces present a larger potential attack surface for adversaries looking to create instability in power systems. To address this area of concern, the steps of a cyberattack on DERs have been studied, including the security of industrial protocols, the misuse of the DER interface, and the physical impacts. These different steps have not previously been tied together in practice and not specifically studied for grid-connected storage devices. In this work, we focus on grid-connected batteries. We explore the potential impacts of a cyberattack on a battery to power system stability, to the battery hardware, and on economics for various stakeholders. We then use real hardware to demonstrate end-to-end attack paths exist when security features are disabled or misconfigured. Our experimental focus is on control interface security and protocol security, with the initial assumption that an adversary has gained access to the network to which the device is connected. We provide real examples of the effectiveness of certain defenses. This work can be used to help utilities and other grid-connected battery owners and operators evaluate the severity of different threats and the effectiveness of defense strategies so they can effectively deploy and protect grid-connected storage devices.

Autonomous haulage systems in the mining industry: Cybersecurity, communication and safety issues and challenges. The current advancement of robotics, especially in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), leads to a prominent combination between the mining industry and connected-embedded technologies. This progress has arisen in the form of state-of-the-art automated giant vehicles with Autonomous Haulage Systems (AHS) that can transport ore without human intervention. Like CPS, AHS enable autonomous and/or remote control of physical systems (e.g., mining trucks). Thus, similar to CPS, AHS are also susceptible to cyber attacks such as Wi-Fi De-Auth and GPS attacks. With the use of the AHS, several mining activities have been strengthened due to increasing the efficiency of operations. Such activities require ensuring accurate data collection from which precise information about the state of the mine should be generated in a timely and consistent manner. Consequently, the presence of secure and reliable communications is crucial in making AHS mines safer, productive, and sustainable. This paper aims to identify and discuss the relation between safety of AHS in the mining environment and both cybersecurity and communication as well as highlighting their challenges and open issues. We survey the literature that addressed this aim and discuss its pros and cons and then highlight some open issues. We conclude that addressing cybersecurity issues of AHS can ensure the safety of operations in the mining environment as well as providing reliable communication, which will lead to better safety. Additionally, it was found that new communication technologies, such 5G and LTE, could be adopted in AHS-based systems for mining, but further research is needed to considered related cybersecurity issues and attacks.

Cybersecurity in the European Union port sector in light of the digital transformation and the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of digital transformation, which is playing a fundamental role in the current COVID-19 worldwide panorama, has impacted all sectors of society, including the port sector. Albeit being a conservative sector, reluctant to change, it has been receptive to the opportunities offered by new information and communication systems and technologies, since they increase the efficiency of operation and, consequently, the competitive advantage of the port in the market. However, the digital era also brings new risks and threats, such as cyber-attacks. For various reasons, especially the lack of awareness about cybersecurity, such risks and threats are not being properly considered by the sector, leaving it vulnerable to attacks of this nature. In view of the importance of this sector to the EU Member States, given its status of critical infrastructure and its importance for the European economies, and the rise of cyber-attacks since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, it is vital to analyze the issue of cybersecurity in ports in view of digital transformation and understand the current situation.

However, as the number of drones is expanding and their technological functionalities are evolving, drones’ use brings many concerns and challenges that should not be underestimated. This refers to issues in the area of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. UASs, under the international, regional, and national regime of aviation law, are considered aircraft. Since there is no existing cybersecurity framework specific to the UASs, the civil aviation cybersecurity framework should apply to their operations. This paper will focus on the potential cyber threats against UASs, providing examples of cyber-attacks from the past. Further, the aviation cybersecurity framework’s overview will follow to determine the current status of maturity at the international, regional (the European Union), and national (the Republic of Poland) levels. The paper’s conclusion will address the proposed recommendations for the UAS and aviation industries to be considered and potential solutions in terms of applying the aviation cybersecurity framework into the operation of UASs.

Design and Evaluation of COFELET-based Approaches for Cyber Security Learning and Training. Cyber security game-based learning is a new field that lacks design standards and common methodologies. To this end, the Conceptual Framework for eLearning and Training (COFELET) and the COFELET ontology have been proposed. COFELET is a framework that can be used as a guide for the design and evaluation of effective cyber security learning and training approaches, whereas the COFELET ontology describes the key elements that such approaches should embrace to assimilate well known cyber security threat analysis and modeling standards as the means to create interesting educational experiences. Aiming at providing insights on how COFELET compliant approaches can be developed, we propose the life-cycle of a COFELET game, a blueprint illustrating the design aspects and the course of phases for the development of COFELET compliant games (COFELET games). Besides, an extension of the COFELET ontology is also proposed describing the appropriate elements utilized to develop the learning and the instructional aspects of COFELET games. Based on the life-cycle of a COFELET game and the extended COFELET ontology, we elaborate the design of a prototype hacking simulator COFELET game, called HackLearn. An excerpt of the HackLearn's design is methodically presented along with the analysis elaborated according to the Activity Theory Model for Serious Games (ATMSG) and a set of instances of the COFELET ontology objects. Finally, the HackLearn's game design is put on the test of a preliminary evaluation scheme elaborated for the assessment of new cyber security game-based learning approaches. The results of the evaluation show that HackLearn embraces several features of cyber security game-based learning approaches and they also provide reasons to be optimistic about the effectiveness of the cyber security learning and training that it will deliver.

Tree parity machine guided patients’ privileged based secure sharing of electronic medical record: cybersecurity for telehealth during COVID-19. In the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth plays a significant role in the e-healthcare. E-health security risks have also risen significantly with the rise in the use of telehealth. This paper addresses one of e-health’s key concerns, namely security. Secret sharing is a cryptographic method to ensure reliable and secure access to information. To eliminate the constraint that in the existing secret sharing schemes, this paper presents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) guided patients’ privileged based secure sharing. This is a new secret sharing technique that generates the shares using a simple mask based operation. This work considers addressing the challenges presents in the original secret sharing scheme. This proposed technique enhances the security of the existing scheme. This research introduces a concept of privileged share in which among k number of shares one share should come from a specific recipient (patient) to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the original information. In the absence of this privileged share, the original information cannot be reconstructed. This technique also offers TPM based exchange of secret shares to prevent Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM). Here, two neural networks receive common inputs and exchange their outputs. In some steps, it leads to full synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the specific rule of learning. This synchronized weight is used as a common secret session key for transmitting the secret shares. The proposed method has been found to produce attractive results that show that the scheme achieves a great degree of protection, reliability, and efficiency and also comparable to the existing secret sharing scheme.

Cyber security in the age of COVID-19: A timeline and analysis of cyber-crime and cyber-attacks during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was a remarkable, unprecedented event which altered the lives of billions of citizens globally resulting in what became commonly referred to as the new-normal in terms of societal norms and the way we live and work. Aside from the extraordinary impact on society and business as a whole, the pandemic generated a set of unique cyber-crime related circumstances which also affected society and business. The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyber-attacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyber-attacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyber-attack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, three or four unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged salient events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and execute cyber-crime campaigns.

Cyber Security Threats to Bitcoin Exchanges: Adversary Exploitation and Laundering Techniques. Bitcoin is gaining traction as an alternative store of value. Its market capitalization transcends all other cryptocurrencies in the market. But its high monetary value also makes it an attractive target to cyber criminal actors. Hacking campaigns usually target an ecosystem's weakest points. In Bitcoin, the exchange platforms are one of them. Each exchange breach is a threat not only to direct victims, but to the credibility of Bitcoin's entire ecosystem. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is subpar compared to other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. Furthermore we show that overall security posture has improved, but still has major flaws. To discover adversarial methods post-breach, we have analyzed two cases of BTC laundering. Through this analysis we provide insight into how exchange platforms with lax cyber security even further increase the intermediary risk introduced by them into the Bitcoin ecosystem. attacks.

The Microfoundations of State Cybersecurity: Cyber Risk Perceptions and the Mass Public. Cybersecurity represents a unique national security challenge for states: data breaches with the potential for national, macro-level consequences are most likely to occur at the micro-level, originating through the security errors of individual computer users. Thus, aspects of national cybersecurity can often critically depend on the personal attitudes and behavior of average citizens connecting online. However, to date, theories of state cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on the macro-level, and very little is known about how the mass public reacts to-and protects themselves from-cybersecurity threats. This study addresses this gap, drawing on psychological theories of risk perception to explain why the public simultaneously reports great concern about cybersecurity, yet does little to protect their personal safety online. Using a novel survey experiment, we examine how exposure to different types of data breaches impacts citizens' cyber risk assessments, personal online behavior, and support for various national cybersecurity policies. We find that baseline concerns about cybersecurity and knowledge about safe online practices are very low. However, exposure to a personally relevant data breach heightens risk perception and increases willingness to engage in safer online practices. But these effects are circumscribed-actual online behavior is more resistant to change. These results have important implications for the design of effective state cybersecurity policy. cybersecurity policies. experiment. public opinion. risk. threat perception. 
Cybersecurity named entity recognition using bidirectional long short-term memory with conditional random fields. Network texts have become important carriers of cybersecurity information on the Internet. These texts include the latest security events such as vulnerability exploitations, attack discoveries, advanced persistent threats, and so on. Extracting cybersecurity entities from these unstructured texts is a critical and fundamental task in many cybersecurity applications. However, most Named Entity Recognition (NER) models are suitable only for general fields, and there has been little research focusing on cybersecurity entity extraction in the security domain. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel cybersecurity entity identification model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Conditional Random Fields (Bi-LSTM with CRF) to extract security-related concepts and entities from unstructured text. This model, which we have named XBiLSTM-CRF, consists of a word-embedding layer, a bidirectional LSTM layer, and a CRF layer, and concatenates X input with bidirectional LSTM output. Via extensive experiments on an open-source dataset containing an office security bulletin, security blogs, and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, we demonstrate that XBiLSTM-CRF achieves better cybersecurity entity extraction than state-of-the-art models.

A Review on the Effectiveness of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Cyber Security. In recent years there exists a wide variety of cyber attacks with the drastic development of the internet technology. Detection of these attacks is of more significant in today’s cyber world scenario. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have been preferred by researchers across different disciplines for providing solutions to their problems. In this paper we have presented a detailed classification of various DL/ML algorithms. In addition to that a focused survey on the use of various ML/DL methods for the detection of different categories of attacks has been presented. Furthermore the various platforms and tools used for implementing DL/ML methods are explored and the security solutions for the different categories of attacks are summarized.

Attacker–defender model against quantal response adversaries for cyber security in logistics management: An introductory study. Interest in cyber security in logistics and supply chain management has grown, but this has not been matched by academic research. Increasingly, the logistics industry is implementing the Internet-of-Things (IoT), namely sensors and actuators, to collect data, process orders and deliver materials and/or products. This automation reduces human errors in processing orders and enhances the efficiency of order deliveries. However, this can be interrupted by attacks from cyberspace, especially from the Internet. In this paper, we propose a novel attacker–defender model against a quantal response (QR) adversary to protect critical assets by considering the defending budget and the asset dependency. Each asset in the solution is represented by its security level indicating its desirability for being protected. Due to the non-convexity of our model, we propose a Method of Successive Average heuristic with randomised initial conditions (MSAR) to obtain a promising solution. Attacker–defender model.

The cybersecurity qualifications as the prerequisite for the cybersecurity certification of entities. Cybersecurity is one of the key aspects of cyber-governance. There is no way of maintaining an effective state administration without proper cybersecurity measures. A relatively new way of strengthening overall cybersecurity of the Union is the widespread use of the cybersecurity certification. The certification procedures are now primarily focused on products, but that will probably shift in the future. Instead of ever-evolving products, there shall be certification procedures for services, processes and maybe even for the entities themselves. Even though there are no foundations for this idea to evolve yet, the qualification frameworks could possibly present a solution to this predicament, a first step of defining the future schematic requirements. In this article, I present the possible future for the certification systems and emphasize the importance of the qualification frameworks as the prerequisite for the entities-stage of cybersecurity certification.

Progress towards Czech national cybersecurity qualifications framework. Cybersecurity is a crucial aspect of the progress towards cybergovernance. The coordinated and joined approach to ensure high level of cybersecurity throughout the country´s ICT infrastructures involves apart from the centralized cybersecurity activities and collaboration among CSIRTs also unified understanding of cybersecurity requirements, roles and activities among commercial entities, governmental agencies as well as individual cybersecurity experts. We present our current progress towards establishing such qualifications framework in the Czech Republic. Cybergovernance. Cybersecurity. Qualifications. 
Cybersecurity in Construction: Where Do We Stand and How Do We Get Better Prepared. The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is increasingly becoming digital and more prone to cyber-attacks. Although there are several studies and standards in the cybersecurity domain, experts suggest that domain-specific studies need to be conducted to address the unique challenges faced within each of the different industries. Therefore, several cybersecurity studies have been undertaken for various industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunication, and energy. However, this type of study is largely missing in the AEC industry due to different reasons, including lack of awareness. To address that, this study aims to (a) compare and analyze the number of cybersecurity-related documents in the AEC industry with several other industries, and (b) extract and analyze the cybersecurity-related documents data to identify potential future research trends and topics for the AEC community. The Web of Science (WOS) database, consisting of significant and influential journal publications, was used for document retrieval. VOSviewer was used to identify key research topics and trends in the cybersecurity domain and define future cybersecurity research in the AEC industry. WOS document retrieval results that compared the total number of publications corroborated the little to no attention received to cybersecurity investigation in the AEC industry. In addition, the VOSviewer analysis revealed three significant areas of research in the cybersecurity community that provide a reasonably justified roadmap for conducting cybersecurity research in the AEC industry. This study could greatly benefit the AEC research community and potential reaping benefits to the industry by creating more awareness among different stakeholders. construction automation. construction digitalization. cyber security. cyber-physical systems. text mining. 
Decision support model for cybersecurity risk planning: A two-stage stochastic programming framework featuring firms, government, and attacker. We study the decision-making problem in cybersecurity risk planning concerning resource allocation strategies by government and firms. Aiming to minimize the social costs incurred due to cyberattacks, we consider not only the monetary investment costs but also the deprivation costs due to detection and containment delays. We also consider the effect of positive externalities of the overall cybersecurity investment on an individual firm's resource allocation attitude. The optimal decision guides the firms on the countermeasure portfolio mix (detection vs. prevention vs. containment) and government intelligence investments while accounting for actions of a strategic attacker and firm budgetary limitations. We accomplish this via a two-stage stochastic programming model. In the first stage, firms decide on prevention and detection investments aided by government intelligence investments that improve detection effectiveness. In the second stage, once the attacker's actions are realized, firms decide on containment investments after evaluating the cyberattacks. We demonstrate the applicability of our model via a case study. We find that externality can reduce the government's intelligence investment and that the firm's detection investment receives priority over containment. We also note that while prevention effectiveness has a decreasing impact on intelligence, it is beneficial to spend more on intelligence given its increasing returns to the reduction of social costs related to cybersecurity.

Internet of things meet internet of threats: New concern cyber security issues of critical cyber infrastructure. As a new area of technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a flagship and promising paradigm for innovating society. However, IoT-based critical infrastructures are an appealing target for cybercriminals. Such distinctive infrastructures are increasingly sensitive to cyber vulnerabilities and subject to many cyberattacks. Thus, protecting these infrastructures is a significant issue for organizations and nations. In this context, raising the cybersecurity posture of critical cyber infrastructures is an extremely urgent international issue. In addition, with the rapid development of adversarial techniques, current cyber threats have become more sophisticated, complicated, advanced and persistent. Thus, given these factors, prior to implementing efficient and resilient cybersecurity countermeasures, identification and in-depth mapping of cyber threats is an important step that is generally overlooked. Therefore, to solve cybersecurity challenges, this study presents a critical analysis of the most recent cybersecurity issues for IoT-based critical infrastructures. We then discuss potential cyber threats and cyber vulnerabilities and the main exploitation strategies adopted by cybercriminals. Further, we provide a taxonomy of cyberattacks that may affect critical cyber infras-tructures. Finally, we present security requirements and some realistic recommendations to enhance cybersecurity solutions. Critical cyber infrastructure. Cyber attacks. Cyber security.

Cybersafety approach to cybersecurity analysis and mitigation for mobility-as-a-service and internet of vehicles. Urban mobility is in the midst of a revolution, driven by the convergence of technologies such as artificial intelligence, on-demand ride services, and Internet-connected and self-driving vehicles. Technological advancements often lead to new hazards. Coupled with the increased levels of automation and connectivity in the new generation of autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity is emerging as a key threat affecting these vehicles. Traditional hazard analysis methods treat safety and security in isolation and are limited in their ability to account for interactions among organizational, sociotechnical, human, and technical components. In response to these challenges, the cybersafety method, based on System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA and STPA-Sec), was developed to meet the growing need to holistically analyze complex sociotechnical systems. We applied cybersafety to coanalyze safety and security hazards, as well as identify mitigation requirements. The results were compared with another promising method known as Combined Harm Analysis of Safety and Security for Information Systems (CHASSIS). Both methods were applied to the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) use cases, focusing on over-the-air software updates feature. Overall, cybersafety identified additional hazards and more effective requirements compared to CHASSIS. In particular, cybersafety demonstrated the ability to identify hazards due to unsafe/unsecure interactions among sociotechnical components. This research also suggested using CHASSIS methods for information lifecycle analysis to complement and generate additional considerations for cybersafety. Finally, results from both methods were backtested against a past cyber hack on a vehicular system, and we found that recommendations from cybersafety were likely to mitigate the risks of the incident.

Deep Cybersecurity: A Comprehensive Overview from Neural Network and Deep Learning Perspective. Deep learning, which is originated from an artificial neural network (ANN), is one of the major technologies of today’s smart cybersecurity systems or policies to function in an intelligent manner. Popular deep learning techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network or long short-term memory, self-organizing map, auto-encoder, restricted Boltzmann machine, deep belief networks, generative adversarial network, deep transfer learning, as well as deep reinforcement learning, or their ensembles and hybrid approaches can be used to intelligently tackle the diverse cybersecurity issues. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive overview from the perspective of these neural networks and deep learning techniques according to today’s diverse needs. We also discuss the applicability of these techniques in various cybersecurity tasks such as intrusion detection, identification of malware or botnets, phishing, predicting cyberattacks, e.g. denial of service, fraud detection or cyberanomalies, etc. Finally, we highlight several research issues and future directions within the scope of our study in the field. Overall, the ultimate goal of this paper is to serve as a reference point and guidelines for the academia and professionals in the cyber industries, especially from the deep learning point of view.

Textual entailment for cybersecurity: An applicative case. Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is the task of recognizing the relation between two sentences, in order to measure whether and to what extent one of the two is inferred from the other. It is used in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In the last decades, with the digitization of many legal documents, NLP applied to the legal domain has became prominent, due to the need of knowing which norms are complied with in case other norms are. In this context, from a set of obligations that are known to be complied with, RTE may be used to infer which other norms are complied with as well. We propose a dataset, regarding cybersecurity controls, for RTE on the legal domain. The dataset has been constructed using information available online, provided by domain experts from NIST (https://www.nist.gov). 
Assessment of cybersecurity awareness among students of Majmaah University. Information exchange has become increasingly faster and efficient through the use of recent technological advances, such as instant messaging and social media platforms. Consequently, access to information has become easier. However, new types of cybersecurity threats that typically result in data loss and information misuse have emerged simultaneously. Therefore, maintaining data privacy in complex systems is important and necessary, particularly in organizations where the vast majority of individuals interacting with these systems is students. In most cases, students engage in data breaches and digital misconduct due to the lack of knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity and the consequences of cybercrime. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the level of cybersecurity awareness and user compliance among undergraduate students at Majmaah University using a scientific questionnaire based on several safety factors for the use of the Internet. We quantitatively evaluated the knowledge of cybercrime and protection among students to show the need for user education, training, and awareness. In this study, we used a quantitative research methodology and conducted different statistical tests, such as ANOVA, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett’s tests, to evaluate and analyze the hypotheses. Safety concerns for electronic emails, computer viruses, phishing, forged ads, popup windows, and supplementary outbreaks on the Internet were well-examined in this study. Finally, we present recommendations based on the collected data to deal with this common problem. Cybersecurity. Information security. Security awareness. Statistical analysis. 
Emotional reactions to cybersecurity breach situations: Scenario-based survey study. Background: With the ever-expanding interconnectedness of the internet and especially with the recent development of the Internet of Things, people are increasingly at risk for cybersecurity breaches that can have far-reaching consequences for their personal and professional lives, with psychological and mental health ramifications. Objective: We aimed to identify the dimensional structure of emotion processes triggered by one of the most emblematic scenarios of cybersecurity breach, the hacking of one’s smart security camera, and explore which personality characteristics systematically relate to these emotion dimensions. Methods: A total of 902 participants from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands reported their emotion processes triggered by a cybersecurity breach scenario. Moreover, they reported on their Big Five personality traits, as well as on key indicators for resilient, overcontrolling (internalizing problems), and undercontrolling (aggression) personality types. Results: Principal component analyses revealed a clear 3-dimensional structure of emotion processes: emotional intensity, proactive versus fight/flight reactions, and affective versus cognitive/motivational reactions. Regression analyses revealed that more internalizing problems (β=.33, P<.001), resilience (β=.22, P<.001), and agreeableness (β=.12, P<.001) and less emotional stability (β=–.25, P<.001) have significant predictive value for higher emotional intensity. More internalizing problems (β=.26, P<.001), aggression (β=.25, P<.001), and extraversion (β=.07, P=.01) and less resilience (β=–.19, P<.001), agreeableness (β=–.34, P<.001), consciousness (β=–.19, P<.001), and openness (β=–.22, P<.001) have significant predictive value for comparatively more fight/flight than proactive reactions. Less internalizing problems (β=–.32, P<.001) and more emotional stability (β=.14, P<.001) and aggression (β=.13, P<.001) have significant predictive value for a comparatively higher salience for cognitive/motivational than affective reactions. Conclusions: To adequately describe the emotion processes triggered by a cybersecurity breach, two more dimensions are needed over and above the general negative affectivity dimension. This multidimensional structure is further supported by the differential relationships of the emotion dimensions with personality characteristics. The discovered emotion structure could be used for consistent predictions about who is at risk to develop long-term mental well-being issues due to a cybersecurity breach experience.

An ism modeling of barriers for blockchain/distributed ledger technology adoption in supply chains towards cybersecurity. Over the last few years, the increasing level of cyber risks derived from the growing connectedness of Industry 4.0 has led to the emergence of blockchain technology as a major innovation in supply chain cybersecurity. The main purpose of this study is to identify and rank the significant barriers affecting the implementation of blockchain technology as a key component of cyber supply chain risk management (CSCRM). This research relied on the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique in the structure of a hierarchical model to investigate the contextual relationships of identified challenges for blockchain adoption in CSCRM. it also classifies the influential challenges based on their driving and dependence powers. The results highlight that cryptocurrency volatility is the challenge at the top level of the hierarchy, implying weak driving power but it is strongly dependent on the other challenges. Poor regulatory provisions, technology immaturity, dependent on input information from external oracles, scalability and bandwidth issues, and smart contract issues are significant challenges for the adoption of blockchain in cyber supply chain risk management and are located at the bottom level of the hierarchy with higher driving power. The implications for theory and practice of the research are also highlighted. Blockchain technology. Cyber supply chain risk management. ISM. MICMAC. 
Assessing mitre att&ck risk using a cyber-security culture framework. The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework provides a rich and actionable repository of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures. Its innovative approach has been broadly welcomed by both vendors and enterprise customers in the industry. Its usage extends from adversary emulation, red teaming, behavioral analytics development to a defensive gap and SOC (Security Operations Center) maturity assessment. While extensive research has been done on analyzing specific attacks or specific organizational culture and human behavior factors leading to such attacks, a holistic view on the association of both is currently missing. In this paper, we present our research results on associating a comprehensive set of organizational and individual culture factors (as described on our developed cyber-security culture framework) with security vulnerabilities mapped to specific adversary behavior and patterns utilizing the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Thus, exploiting MITRE ATT&CK’s possibilities towards a scientific direction that has not yet been explored: security assessment and defensive design, a step prior to its current application domain. The suggested cyber-security culture framework was originally designed to aim at critical infrastructures and, more specifically, the energy sector. Organizations of these domains exhibit a co-existence and strong interaction of the IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) networks. As a result, we emphasize our scientific effort on the hybrid MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise and ICS (Industrial Control Systems) model as a broader and more holistic approach. The results of our research can be utilized in an extensive set of applications, including the efficient organization of security procedures as well as enhancing security readiness evaluation results by providing more insights into imminent threats and security risks.

A Cybersecurity Moonshot. Cybersecurity needs radical rethinking to change its current landscape. This article charts a vision for a cybersecurity moonshot based on radical but feasible technologies that can prevent the largest classes of vulnerabilities in modern systems. 
Team performance in a series of regional and national US cybersecurity defense competitions: Generalizable effects of training and functional role specialization. A critical component to any modern cybersecurity endeavor is effective use of its human resources to secure networks, maintain services and mitigate adversarial events. Despite the importance of the human cyber- analyst and operator to cybersecurity, there has not been a corresponding rise in data-driven analytical approaches for understanding, evaluating, and improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity teams as a whole. Fortunately, cyber defense competitions are well-established and provide a critical window into what makes a cybersecurity team more or less effective. We examined data collected at the national finals and four regional events of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and posited that experience, access to simulation-based training, and functional role composition by the teams would predict team performance on four scoring dimensions relevant to the application of information assurance skills and defensive cyber operations: (a) maintaining services, (b) help-desk customer support, (c) handling scenario injects, and (d) mitigating red team attacks. Bayesian analysis highlighted that experience was a strong predictor of service availability, scenario injects, and red team defense. Simulation training was also associated with good performance along these scoring dimensions. High-performing and experienced teams clustered with one another based on the functional role composition of team skills. These results are discussed within the context of stages of team development, the efficacy of challenge-based learning events, and reinforce previous analytical results from cyber competitions.

A hybrid attack detection strategy for cybersecurity using moth elephant herding optimisation-based stacked autoencoder. Cybersecurity is a major concern in the network resources of the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, as the attacks on the IoT devices degrade the performance of the computational operations. Various attack detection methods are adopted in the research area to prevent an illegal user from accessing the resources. To resolve the vulnerabilities in the computing devices, an effective attack detection method, named, Moth Elephant Herding Optimisation (MEHO)-based stacked autoencoder approach is proposed in this research. Initially, the input data is passed into the pre-processing stage, where the data is cleaned by removing the noise and artefacts. The pre-processed data is further subjected to the feature selection stage, where the Class-Wise Information Gain technique (CIG) is used to select the essential features. The class-aware features, like traffic-based features, content-based features and basic features are selected efficiently. Finally, the attack detection is performed using the stacked autoencoder classifier, which is trained using the proposed MEHO algorithm. The MEHO algorithm is developed by integrating the Moth search (MS) algorithm and the Elephant Herding Optimisation (EHO). The performance is evaluated using the metrics, like accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and detection rate, acquired with the values of 0.9286, 0.0636 and 0.9258 respectively. 
NEDetector: Automatically extracting cybersecurity neologisms from hacker forums. Underground hacker forums serve as an online social platform for hackers to communicate and spread hacking techniques and tools. In these forums, a lot of latest information indirectly or directly affects cyberspace security, thereby threatening the assets of enterprises or individuals. Therefore, social media such as hacker forums and twitter have a great impact on the cybersecurity area. In recent years, analyzing hacker forum data to explore hacking activities and cybersecurity situational awareness have aroused widespread interest among researchers. Automatically identifying cybersecurity words and extracting neologisms from open source social platforms are less successful and still require further research. In order to provide early warning of cyber attack incidents, we proposed NEDetector, a novel method to automatically identify cybersecurity words and extract neologisms from unstructured content, mainly focus on attack groups and hacking tools. NEDetector firstly analyzes the cybersecurity words and proposes four group features to build cybersecurity words identification model based on Bidirectional LSTM algorithm. Secondly, NEDetector introduces 4 sets of features to identify cybersecurity neologisms based on RandomForest algorithm. The experiment result shows that the whole system of NEDetector achieves an identification precision of 89.11%. Furthermore, the proposed extracting neologisms system is often earlier than having enough data in Google Trends when performing predictions on Twitter data, which prove the validity and timeliness of presented system.

Evaluating the cyber security readiness of organizations and its influence on performance. The acceleration of cyber-attacks in recent years has negatively impacted the overall performance of organizations around the world. Organizations face the challenge of enhancing their cyber security to prevent and combat cyber-attacks, but studies of factors impacting the cyber security awareness/readiness of organizations from a holistic perspective are lacking. This study adopts the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework to examine a comprehensive set of factors influencing the cyber security readiness of organizations and the effects of these factors on organizational performance (financial and non-financial) mediated by improved organizational security performance. Data are collected via a survey of IT professionals in Bahrain, with 270 valid responses. The results confirm the importance of seven of nine factors affecting cyber security readiness identified in previous studies. Cyber security readiness is found to positively impact organizational security performance, which in turn positively affects financial and non-financial performance. The newly proposed comprehensive model of factors affecting the cyber security readiness of organizations and the evidence of their importance can be used to guide future research and enhance the current understanding of how organizations can better equip themselves to minimize the occurrence and impact of cyber-attacks.

Adversarial attacks on machine learning cybersecurity defences in Industrial Control Systems. The proliferation and application of machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have allowed for more flexibility and efficiency in the automated detection of cyber attacks in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, the introduction of such IDSs has also created an additional attack vector. the learning models may also be subject to cyber attacks, otherwise referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 6 and 11 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks. Adversarial Machine Learning. Attack detection. Industrial Control Systems.

Pressurizer dynamic model and emulated programmable logic controllers for nuclear power plants cybersecurity investigations. This work demonstrates the functionality of the pressurizer using a fast-running three regions, non-equilibrium model and control programs of emulated PLCs. The state variables from an integrated model of primary loop in a representative PWR plant are communicated to the pressurizer's emulated PLCs using a synchronized data transfer function. In turn, the PLCs communicate back instructions to the pressurizer model to adjust the pressure and water level to remain within preprogramed setpoints. Pressurizer model simultaneously solves the coupled mass and energy conservation equations in the saturated vapor and saturated and subcooled liquid regions using fixed step solver. Results demonstrate the response of the pressurizer model linked to an emulated pressure and water level PLCs in a simulated transient involving surge-in and surge-out events. The 50 ms response delay time for the emulated PLCs insignificantly affects operation and predictions of the pressurizer model. Data Transfer Function. Emulated PLCs. I&C systems. Non-equilibrium.

Analysis of Cybersecurity-related Incidents in the Process Industry. The digital transition in the process industry is characterized by a high level of automation and an increasing connection with external networks, which makes facilities vulnerable to cybers-threats. A cyber-attack, beside economic and reputational damages, can potentially trigger major events (e.g. releases of hazardous materials, fires, explosions) with severe consequences on workers, population, and the environment. In the present study, the cybersecurity-related incidents that occurred in the process industry and in similar industrial sectors (chemical, petrochemical, energy production, water/wastewater treatment) were investigated. The aim of the study is to frame a clear picture of the cyber-attacks on the automated control systems of process facilities and to issue lessons learnt from past incidents. The study is based on the development and analysis of a database of 82 cybersecurity-related incidents gathered from various sources. Time trend, geographical distribution, distribution among the industrial sectors, impacts of the incidents, and nature of the cyber-attacks (attacker, intentional/accidental type, system infected) were investigated. The analysis of a sub-set of more detailed incidents allowed the identification of the general steps of a cyber-attack on automated control systems of a process facility, the main hacking techniques used by the attackers and the more common cybersecurity countermeasures applicable to the prevention of a cyber-attack. cyber-attack. cybersecurity-related incident. major event.

Design and implementation of a SMART Learning environment for the Upskilling of Cybersecurity professionals in Mauritius. Teaching and Learning confined to within the four walls of a classroom or even online Learning through Massive Online Courses (MOOCs) and other Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS) are no longer seen as the optimal approach for competency and skills development, especially for working professionals. Each of these busy learners have their own training needs and prior knowledge. Adopting the one-size-fits-all teaching approach is definitely not effective, motivating and encouraging. For some learners, the content might be too easy and for others, it might be too difficult. This is why this research presents the use of SMART Learning Environment that makes use of Intelligent Techniques to personalise the learning materials for each learner. This mismatch in skills is becoming a pressing issue and is having a direct impact on the ICT Sector, which is one of the pillars of the Mauritian Economy. This research, therefore, besides proposing a novel approach to learning, also attempts to address an issue of national importance. Data was collected during three phases, namely an Expert Reference Group Discussion, a pre-test questionnaire and a survey questionnaire. The Expert Reference Group Discussion was carried out to further understand the training needs and expectations of Cybersecurity professionals in Mauritius. A SMART Learning Environment making use of Artificial Neural Networks and Backpropagation Algorithm to personalise learning materials was eventually designed and implemented. The major findings of this research were that personalisation of learning materials through the use of a SMART Learning Environment can be used to address the training needs of Cybersecurity professionals in Mauritius.

Augmenting Cybersecurity in Autonomous Vehicles: Innovative Recommendations for Aspiring Entrepreneurs. Autonomous and connected vehicles are a collection of smart components such as sensors, Radar/Lidar, Electronic Control Units (ECUs), and cameras programmed through voluminous lines of codes, which enable a seamless communication system between the user, vehicle, and infrastructure. The concept of autonomous vehicles is gaining significant traction in the global markets, generating higherrevenues, and witnessing high market penetration, thus attracting entrepreneurs to make new and disruptive innovations. However, the underlying technology and communication system of autonomous and connected vehicles are prone to the cybersecurity threats, which circumvent any product that uses sensors, transmits data over the network, and can be controlled through a remote computer or a mobile application. In this article, we attempt to outline the concerns that an aspiring entrepreneur should be aware of before entering into the autonomous vehicle industry, followed by innovative recommendations that can guide addressing the article's issues. The presented recommendations and guidelines are based on the cybersecurity principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
CYBER SECURITY AND ITS REALITY IN BANGLADESH: AN ANALYSIS OF EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. With the rapid penetration of the Internet and other information and communication technology worldwide, cyber-crime is emerging as a threat to personal data stored in computers and is likely to affect the entire data systems. Even the United States, one of the most technologically advanced countries, is also subjected to such crimes. Bangladesh, being a less developed country, is also under the risk of cyber-crimes that could jeopardize the country’s national security. As the incumbent government aims to ensure Internet connectivity in all government institutions by 2021, upholding the motto of ‘Digital Bangladesh’, more and more national and multinational companies are offering online services for their services through the Internet as they follow the government’s agenda. From shopping to banking, all are just a click away with a higher rate of Internet penetration. However, criminals are also using the same online platform where they are committing various sorts of criminal activities, including phishing, hacking and stealing personal data. Hence both state-owned and private organizations could fall prey to cyber-attacks which can affect the lives of the entire population. Furthermore, 90% of the country’s software is unlicensed, which also intensifies the risk of cybercrimes due to their compromised security. In addition, the recent tug of war between Bangladeshi and Indian hackers has impacted the diplomatic relations between the two nations. More importantly, scores of media reports have been saying that terror groups use the online platforms for financing and maintaining intra-group communications. In this context, the existing laws and government measures against cyber-crimes are very weak to combat the burgeoning threat. This study attempts to shed light upon the threat posed by cyber-crimes in the context of the global village, with an emphasis on the perspective of Bangladesh. Bangladesh. Cyber-crimes.

Improving Radioactive Material Localization by Leveraging Cyber-Security Model Optimizations. One of the principal uses of physical-space sensors in public safety applications is the detection of unsafe conditions (e.g., release of poisonous gases, weapons in airports, tainted food). However, current detection methods in these applications are often costly, slow to use, and can be inaccurate in complex, changing, or new environments. In this paper, we explore how machine learning methods used successfully in cyber domains, such as malware detection, can be leveraged to substantially enhance physical space detection. We focus on one important exemplar application-the detection and localization of radioactive materials. We show that the ML-based approaches can significantly exceed traditional table-based approaches in predicting angular direction. Moreover, the developed models can be expanded to include approximations of the distance to radioactive material (a critical dimension that reference tables used in practice do not capture). With four and eight detector arrays, we collect counts of gamma-rays as features for a suite of machine learning models to localize radioactive material. We explore seven unique scenarios via simulation frameworks frequently used for radiation detection and with physical experiments using radioactive material in laboratory environments. We observe that our approach can outperform the standard table-based method, reducing the angular error by 37% and reliably predicting distance within 2.4%. In this way, we show that advances in cyber-detection provide substantial opportunities for enhancing detection in public safety applications and beyond. gamma-ray detectors.

Machine learning methods for cyber security intrusion detection: Datasets and comparative study. The increase in internet usage brings security problems with it. Malicious software can affect the operation of the systems and disrupt data confidentiality due to the security gaps in the systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed to detect and report attacks. In order to develop IDS systems, artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used more frequently. In this study, literature studies using CSE-CIC IDS-2018, UNSW-NB15, ISCX-2012, NSL-KDD and CIDDS-001 data sets, which are widely used to develop IDS systems, are reviewed in detail. In addition, max-min normalization was performed on these data sets and classification was made with support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) algorithms, which are among the classical machine learning approaches. As a result, more successful results have been obtained in some of the studies given in the literature. The study is thought to be useful for developing IDS systems on the basis of artificial intelligence with approaches such as machine learning. Cyber security. DT. IDS. KNN. Machine learning. SVM. 
Designing control and protection systems with regard to integrated functional safety and cybersecurity aspects. This article addresses current problems of risk analysis and probabilistic modelling for functional safety management in the life cycle of safety-related systems. Two main stages in the lifecycle of these systems are distinguished, namely the design and operation. The risk analysis and probabilistic modelling differ in these stages in view of available knowledge and data. Due to the complexity and uncertainty involved, both qualitative and quantitative information can be useful in risk analysis and probabilistic modelling. Some methodological aspects of the functional safety assessment are outlined that include modelling of dependent failures or cybersecurity and verifying the safety integrity level (SIL) under uncertainty. It is illustrated how the assumptions in the process of risk analysis and probabilistic modelling influence results obtained and, therefore, potentially the decisions taken in functional safety management. Programmable control and safety systems play an important role in mitigating and controlling risks in the operation of hazardous installations. This paper presents ways to deal with safety hazards involving such systems to be considered in risk analysis and integrated functional safety and cybersecurity management. Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity Enhancement through Blockchain Training (CEBT) – A serious game approach. Blockchain technology is increasingly finding traction in diverse areas such as finance, supply-chain management, and cloud services because of its ability to provide robust cybersecurity inherent in its system of having decentralized data storage. The rising complexity in the architecture of popular blockchain platforms create barriers to correct adoption of the technology. It becomes imperative that pedagogical tools are inducted in the blockchain ecosystem to address this perceived or real impediments for the uptake of the technology. We propose one of the first such pedagogical tool for training in blockchain using an adversarial sandbox adaptive serious game approach for students and technology professionals. We further propose use of AI to enhance NPC interactivity based on player's responses. We plan to evaluate this serious game on a subjective metrics that is based on a game experience questionnaire.

Cybersecurity by prediction of time synchronization using bayesian base gradient descent approach. Time Commerce tends to struggle, which necessities an improved time framework.Legal escalations for conflicts of time commerce in the digital economy demand a solution that helps to address technology, standards, and policies. To meet the demand, we have to build a system that can understand every domain essential for building an inter-organizational system. Date and Timestamp reflect the root of the current term Date Trade in the cyber world. The threat to these roots has been studied in-depth and proposed solutions specific to UTC NPLI. The electricity grid shifts to the energy network to improve operating efficiency and reliability by developing advanced information and communication technology. However, the Internet also provides a range of entry points dependent on the internet, which produce additional vulnerabilities due to malicious cyber-attacks, thereby threatening Nations' economic health. This paper proposes therefore a new mechanism to protect critical infrastructure against these malicious attacks, based on interval state predictors. This paper uses the prediction-based approach for reducing the impact of such attacks from cyberspace. In prediction, we have used a machine learning approach like Bayesian classifier by Bayesian approach to forecasting time synchronization concerning universal time clock (UTC). In our analysis, we have taken the basic UTC, UTC, and UTC likelihood proposed approach on basis of communication. This work has improved considerably the results to take care of CPS against such cybersecurity threats. Big data. Cyber-physical systems. Indian standard time. Time dissemination. Timestamp. 
CR CyberMar as a solution path towards cybersecurity soundness in maritime logistics domain. Cybersecurity is now considered as one of the main challenges for the maritime sector. At the same time, the maritime transport industry remains one of the most relevant and driving sectors for the global economy in terms of both the number and operations of active companies, and infrastructure and investments, thanks to the policies pushed to attract the latter. Maritime information systems, whether on board ships or in ports, are numerous, built with standard components available on the market and in many cases designed without factoring in well the ever-growing cyber risk. Digital infrastructure has become essential in operating and managing systems critical to the safety and security of shipping and ports. Specifically, Cyber-MAR is focused upon the simulation and emulation of the real world of maritime systems (e.g. Logistics, Supply Chain). This research effort will examine the creation of a federated Cyber Range (CR Cyber-MAR) which will include various platforms and interconnected systems on board a vessel or ashore, in order to allow a hyper-realistic simulation of cyber-attacks and trying to assimilate them into real-life. Then the identified CR Cyber range will be integrated in the Cybersecurity training needs for different levels of operators. The investigation of the discussed topic will essentially use qualitative techniques, analysing data obtained from publications, official and commercial reports, and interviews of a targeted audience.

Cybersecurity for digital twins in the built environment: Current research and future directions. SUMMARY: Recent technological developments in the construction industry are seeking to create smart cities by using Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to enhance information models such as BIM. Currently, BIM models are commonly adopted to work with IoT-based systems and embrace smart technologies that offer interoperability in the communication layer. In future, it is envisioned that digital twins will provide new possibilities for cyber-physical systems via monitoring and simulation. However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities.

Developing a Simulated Intelligent Instrument to Measure User Behavior toward Cybersecurity Policies. Since the science of computer networks began, their use has increased and thus the need for it has increased in all areas of life until it has become a necessity. On the other hand, there are some risks that threaten institutions that rely on networks, especially when using the Internet. So, Institutions struggle to protect themselves from threats and cybercrime. Therefore, they devote much attention to improving information security infrastructures. Users’ behaviors were explored via a traditional questionnaire research instrument in a data collocate process. The questionnaire explores users’ behaviors theoretically, so the respondents’ answers to the questionnaire are insufficiently reliable, and the responses might not reflect actual behavior based on the human bias when facing theoretical problems. This study aims to solve unreliable responses to the questionnaire by developing a simulated intelligent instrument to measure users’ behaviors toward cybersecurity policies in an experimental study using gamification.

Deter framework: A novel paradigm for addressing cybersecurity concerns in mobile healthcare. The use of health apps on mobile devices by healthcare providers and receivers (patients) is proliferating. This has elevated cybersecurity concerns owing to the transmittal of personal health information through the apps. Research literature has mostly focused on the technology aspects of cybersecurity in mobile healthcare. It is equally important to focus on the ethical and regulatory perspectives. This article discusses cybersecurity concerns in mobile healthcare from the ethical perspective, the regulatory/compliance perspective, and the technology perspective. The authors present a comprehensive framework (DeTER) that integrates all three perspectives through which cybersecurity concerns in mobile healthcare could be viewed, understood, and acted upon. Guidance is provided with respect to leveraging the framework in the decision-making process that occurs during the system development life cycle (SDLC). Finally, the authors discuss a case applying the framework to a situation involving the development of a contact tracing mobile health app for pandemics such as COVID-19. Cyber-Security.

Cybersecurity risk assessment in smart city infrastructures. The article is devoted to cybersecurity risk assessment of the dynamic device-to-device networks of a smart city. Analysis of the modern security threats at the IoT/IIoT, VANET, and WSN inter-device infrastructures demonstrates that the main concern is a set of network security threats targeted at the functional sustainability of smart urban infrastructure, the most common use case of smart networks. As a result of our study, systematization of the existing cybersecurity risk assessment methods has been provided. Expert-based risk assessment and active human participation cannot be provided for the huge, complex, and permanently changing digital environment of the smart city. The methods of scenario analysis and functional analysis are specific to industrial risk management and are hardly adaptable to solving cybersecurity tasks. The statistical risk evaluation methods force us to collect statistical data for the calculation of the security indicators for the self-organizing networks, and the accuracy of this method depends on the number of calculating iterations. In our work, we have proposed a new approach for cybersecurity risk management based on object typing, data mining, and quantitative risk assessment for the smart city infrastructure. The experimental study has shown us that the artificial neural network allows us to automatically, unambiguously, and reasonably assess the cyber risk for various object types in the dynamic digital infrastructures of the smart city.

Digital Enterprise and Cyber Security Evolution. Industry 4.0 requires increased connectivity and the use of standard communication protocols which nowadays imply an increased need to protect critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyber threats. One cannot talk about the evolution of the digital enterprise without cyber security. There are a lot of cyber security incidents related to Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things developments. PLM, as a whole concept, is prone to cyber threats due to complex interactions between management of design data, quality management, process management, portfolio management, supply chain management, customer relationship management, and management of whole things which are related to the product. The paper addresses the evolutionary cyber threats in last decade using public resources. At present, the large companies that supply industrial equipment have also taken into account the aspects of cyber security. The paper, also presents certain approaches from a scientific point of view in Constanta Maritime University (CMU) research center for the cyber security. To address this complex research field, CMU started several years ago, a complex research and innovative project related to advanced research, training, and development of new technologies in maritime cyber security. Using the CMU complex cyber security simulator, it is able to generate some massive scenarios in technical related fields such as maritime operations, technical design, and technical simulations and detect potential vulnerabilities. One of these kinds of activities is treated as potential long term risks due to the nature of induced vulnerabilities in PLM software. cloud computing. cyber security. digital enterprise.

Cybersecurity model based on hardening for secure internet of things implementation. The inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT) for building smart cities, smart health, smart grids, and other smart concepts has driven data-driven decision making by managers and automation in each domain. However, the hyper-connectivity generated by IoT networks coupled with limited default security in IoT devices increases security risks that can jeopardize the operations of cities, hospitals, and organizations. Strengthening the security aspects of IoT devices prior to their use in different systems can contribute to minimize the attack surface. This study aimed to model a sequence of seven steps to minimize the attack surface by executing hardening processes. Conducted a systematic literature review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) techniques. In this way, we were able to define a proposed methodology to evaluate the security level of an IoT solution by means of a checklist that considers the security aspects in the three layers of the IoT architecture. A risk matrix adapted to IoT is established to evaluate the attack surface. Finally, a process of hardening and vulnerability analysis is proposed to reduce the attack surface and improve the security level of the IoT solution. Cybersecurity risk. Hardening process.

QKD-Enhanced Cybersecurity Protocols. Security of QKD is guaranteed by the quantum mechanics laws rather than unproven assumptions employed in computational cryptography. Unfortunately, the secret-key rates are way too low and transmission distances are limited. The post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is proposed as an alternative to QKD. However, the PQC protocols are based on conjecture that there are no polynomial time algorithms to break the PQC protocols. To overcome key challenges of both post-quantum cryptography and QKD, we propose to use the QKD only in initialization stage to set-up corresponding cybersecurity protocols. The proposed concept is applied to both computational security and PQC protocols. The proposed QKD-enhanced cybersecurity protocols are tolerant to attacks initiated by quantum computers. computational security. information theoretic security.

Genomic intelligence as Über bio-cybersecurity: The gödel sentence in immuno-cognitive systems. This paper gives formal foundations and evidence from gene science in the post Barbara McClintock era that the Gödel Sentence, far from being an esoteric construction in mathematical logic, is ubiquitous in genomic intelligence that evolved with multi-cellular life. Conditions uniquely found in the Adaptive Immune System (AIS) and Mirror Neuron System (MNS), termed the genomic immuno-cognitive system, coincide with three building blocks in computation theory of Gödel, Turing and Post (G-T-P). (i) Biotic elements have unique digital identifiers with gene codes executing 3D self-assembly for morphology and regulation of the organism using the recursive operation of Self-Ref (Self-Reference) with the other being a self-referential projection of self. (ii) A parallel offline simulation meta/mirror environment in 1-1 relation to online machine executions of self-codes gives G-T-P Self-Rep (Self-Representation). (iii) This permits a digital biotic entity to selfreport that it is under attack by a biotic malware or non-self antigen in the format of the Gödel sentence, resulting in the smarts for contextual novelty production. The proposed unitary G-T-P recursive machinery in AIS and in MNS for social cognition yields a new explanation that the Interferon Gamma factor, known for friend-foe identification in AIS, is also integral to social behaviors. New G-T-P bio-informatics of AIS and novel anti-body production is given with interesting testable implications for COVID-19 pathology. Biology as computation. Genomic intelligence.

Decentralized Consensus Decision-Making for Cybersecurity Protection in Multimicrogrid Systems. Multimicrogrid (MMG) systems play an increasingly important role in the smart grid. They come with various potential cyberattacks, which may cause power supply interruption or even human casualties. Therefore, decision-making for timely mitigation of cyberattack risks is highly desirable in the security protection of power systems. However, there is a lack of effective decentralized decision-making strategies that are able to deal with MMG scenarios through distributed consensus. To address this issue, a decentralized consensus decision-making (DCDM) approach is proposed in this article for the security of MMG systems. It achieves decentralized consensus without the need of a trusted authority or central server, making it distinct from existing consensus methods. Meanwhile, it guarantees the consistency and nonrepudiability of consensus results, which are stored on the blockchain in sequence. In each of the distributed agents, the approach consists of a fuzzy static Bayesian game model (FSB-GM) to determine the optimal security strategy and a hybrid consensus algorithm to achieve consensus. The FSB-GM considers the fuzzy preferences of different types of attackers and defenders. The hybrid consensus algorithm is implemented by the fusion improvement of two consensus mechanisms in the blockchain. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through a case study on an MMG system. Blockchain. cybersecurity.

Cyber security research in the Arab region. In the Arab region where political tensions are recurrent, the strive for security is crucial. This applies equally to the cyberspace, where the need for cyber security is magnified by the level of digitization and technical penetration that the Arab region is experiencing. The Internet penetration rate is generally higher than 90% and in some cases, such as Kuwait, UAE, and Qatar, it approaches 100%. As such, many Arab countries have recognized that the security of cyberspace is an integral part of their economic systems and a matter of national security. This awareness has been followed by policies and actions. Cyber security can be considered as specific to the Arab region as computing itself. Many of the threats, software and hardware developments, and industrial endeavors relating to cyber security are not exclusively tied to the region but are instead of a global character due to the nature of digitalization.. 
Cybersecurity architecture for the internet of medical things and connected devices using blockchain. The internet of medical things (IoMT) has a great role in improving the health around the world. IoMT is having a great impact in our life in which the clinical data of the patient is observed and checked and then can be transferred to the third party for using in the future such as the cloud. IoMT is a huge data system with a continuous developing rate, which implies that we should keep a lot of data secure. We propose a combined security architecture that fuses the standard architecture and new blockchain technology. Blockchain is a temper digital ledger which gives peer-to-peer communication and provides communication between non-trust individuals. Using standard in-depth strategy and blockchain, we are able to develop a method to collect vital signs data from IoMT and connected devices and use blockchain to store and retrieve the collected data in a secure and decentralized fashion within a closed system, suitable for healthcare providers such as private clinics, hospitals, and healthcare organizations were sharing data with each other is required. Right now initially examine the innovation behind Blockchain then propose IoMT-based security architecture utilizing Blockchain to guarantee the security of information transmission between associated nodes. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed scheme presents a non-significant overhead. yet it brings major advantages to meet the standard security and privacy requirements in IoMT. Blockchain.

An Intelligent Tree-Based Intrusion Detection Model for Cyber Security. The widespread use of the Internet of Things and distributed heterogeneous devices has shed light on the implementation of efficient and reliable intrusion detection systems. These systems should be able to efficiently protect data and physical devices from cyber-attacks. However, the huge amount of data with different dimensions and security features can affect the detection accuracy and increase the computation complexity of these systems. Lately, Artificial Intelligence has received significant interest and is now being integrated into these systems to intelligently detect and protect against cyber-attacks. This paper aims to propose an intelligent intrusion detection model to predict and detect attacks in cyberspace. The model is designed based on the concept of Decision Trees, taking into consideration the ranking of the security features. The model is applied to a real dataset for network intrusion detection systems. Moreover, it is validated based on predefined performance evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, precision, recall and Fscore. Meanwhile, the experimental results reveal that our tree-based intrusion detection model can detect and predict cyber-attacks efficiently and reduce the complexity of computation process compared to other traditional machine learning techniques.

Cybersecurity in a post-data environment: Considerations on the regulation of code and the role of producer and consumer liability in smart devices. Smart Devices ‘cross the streams’ of both the physical and virtual worlds and can benefit their users greatly as well as society in general. However, with the growth in popularity of these devices, there is a corresponding growth in risks, both to the user and to the internet at large. This paper outlines the scope of threats which are posed by the hacking of Smart Devices and how these risks can now be physical in nature. The paper then proposes a novel methodology to apportion liability to either the manufacturer or the user, where appropriate. This methodology is based on the principle of negligence, although consumer rights and products liability are also examined from both an American and European perspective. Finally, legislative and judicial shortcomings in relation establishing liability are identified and remedies are proposed, with the intention of establishing a solid legal basis and treatment for cybersecurity.

Cyber security risk assessment for seaports: A case study of a container port. Seaports are fixed infrastructures of maritime transportation systems. Through Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0, ports have faced with digital transformation based on networked cyber physical systems to be a part of smart and intelligent transportation systems. However, besides the advantages, this transformation has brought cyber security gaps and threats which can be resulted in breakdowns in maritime transportation domain. Therefore, port and port facilities should be prepared for cyber threats through holistic risk assessment frameworks for developing proactive actions. Based on these facts, this study has proposed to apply an integrated cyber risk assessment method for a container port with a cyber-physical perspective through analyzing four exemplary cyber-attack scenarios. For each cyber-attack scenario, risk assessment methodology has been applied using integrated cyber security management approach by taking into account the cyber physical assets of the container port. Results show that for the specified cyber threats, the risks have been evaluated non acceptable. Mitigation strategies have also been presented briefly in conclusion. Cyber physical system.

Demystifying analytical information processing capability: The case of cybersecurity incident response. Little is known about how organizations leverage business analytics (BA) to develop, process, and exploit analytical information in cybersecurity incident response (CSIR). Drawing on information processing theory (IPT), we conducted a field study using a multiple case study design to answer the following research question: How do organizations exploit analytical information in the process of cybersecurity incident response by using business analytics? We developed a theoretical framework that explains how organizations respond to the dynamic cyber threat environment by exploiting analytical information processing capability in the CSIR process. This, in turn, leads to positive outcomes in enterprise security performance, delivering both strategic and financial benefits. Our findings contribute to the BA and cybersecurity literature by providing useful insights into BA applications and the facilitation of analytics-driven decision making in CSIR. Further, they contribute to IPT by providing new insights about analytical information needs, mechanisms to seek analytical information, and analytical information use in the process of CSIR.

An analysis of cybersecurity in Dutch annual reports of listed companies. In this paper we study the disclosure of cybersecurity information in Dutch annual reports, such as cybersecurity measures and cyber incidents, from a financial law and economics perspective. We start our discussion with an analysis of the requirements in financial law to disclose cybersecurity information in annual reports. Hereafter, we discuss the incentives for the board regarding disclosing cybersecurity related information and its effect on stakeholders and shareholders. We draft hypotheses regarding the actual disclosure of cybersecurity information and propose a research design of an exploring empirical study. The results of our study show that although there is no strict legal obligation to do so, 87% of the companies mention cybersecurity or similar words in their annual report in 2018. However, only 4 out of 75 companies disclosed more than six specific cybersecurity measures, while openness would generate the highest surplus for society from a social welfare perspective. Some major Dutch banks and employment agencies did not disclose any specific information with regard to their cybersecurity strategy, while those companies are highly vulnerable for cybersecurity incidents. This hampers the protection of creditors, investors and other stakeholders. Our analysis aims to propel the debate on stimulation of self-regulation or possible obligations in financial law concerning cybersecurity in annual reports. Annual report. Cybersecurity.

The Utility of Information Security Training and Education on Cybersecurity Incidents: An empirical evidence. As recent cyber-attacks have been increasing exponentially, the importance of security training for employees also has become growing ever than before. In addition, it is suggested that security training and education be an effective method for discerning cyber-attacks within academia and industries. Despite the importance and the necessity of the training, prior study did not investigate the quantitative utility of security training in an organizational level. Due to the absence of referential studies, many firms are having troubles in making decisions with respect to arranging optimal security training programs with limited security budgets. The main objective of this study is to find out a relationship between cybersecurity training and the number of incidents of organizations. Thus, this study quantified the effectiveness of security training on security incidents as the first study. This research examined the relationship among three main factors. education time, education participants, and outsourcing with numbers of cybersecurity incidents. 7089 firm level data is analyzed through Poisson regression method. Based on analysis results, we found that the negative relationship between security trainings and the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents. This study sheds light on the role of security training and education by suggesting its positive association with reducing the number of incidents in organizations from the quantitative perspective. The result of this study can be used as a referential guide for information security training decision-making procedure in organizations. Information security incidents.

Partial least squares analysis: The interaction effect among cybersecurity, cybercrime and online shopping intention. This study examined the moderating role of cybersecurity in the relationship between cybercrime and online shopping intention among Jordanian customers. A total of 270 online users were the study sample. Online survey was used to gather data which were then analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling run using Smart PLS 3.2.9 software. This study found that the cybersecurity moderated the negative relationship between cybercrime and online shopping intention among Jordanian customers. This study contributes theoretically by filling the gaps in the literature, by proposing the combined use of Perceived Risk Theory and Protection Motivation Theory in using the moderating role of cybersecurity in the relationship between cybercrime and online shopping intention. In practice, this study facilitates E-marketers in improving their company’s online markets by altering the perspectives and intention of customers towards online shopping, particularly through the improvement of cybersecurity policies to assure safe transactions.

User, Usage and Usability: Redefining Human Centric Cyber Security. The effectiveness of cyber security measures are often questioned in the wake of hard hitting security events. Despite much work being done in the field of cyber security, most of the focus seems to be concentrated on system usage. In this paper, we survey advancements made in the development and design of the human centric cyber security domain. We explore the increasing complexity of cyber security with a wider perspective, defining user, usage and usability (3U’s) as three essential components for cyber security consideration, and classify developmental efforts through existing research works based on the human centric security design, implementation and deployment of these components. Particularly, the focus is on studies that specifically illustrate the shift in paradigm from functional and usage centred cyber security, to user centred cyber security by considering the human aspects of users. The aim of this survey is to provide both users and system designers with insights into the workings and applications of human centric cyber security.

Rogue people: on adversarial crowdsourcing in the context of cyber security. Purpose: Over the past decade, many research works in various disciplines have benefited from the endless ocean of people and their potentials (in the form of crowdsourcing) as an effective problem-solving strategy and computational model. But nothing interesting is ever completely one-sided. Therefore, when it comes to leveraging people's power, as the dark side of crowdsourcing, there are some possible threats that have not been considered as should be, such as recruiting black hat crowdworkers for organizing targeted adversarial intentions. The purpose of this paper is to draw more attention to this critical issue through investigation of its different aspects. Design/methodology/approach: To delve into details of such malicious intentions, the related literature and previous researches have been studied. Then, four major typologies for adversarial crowdsourced attacks as well as some real-world scenarios are discussed and delineated. Finally, possible future threats are introduced. Findings: Despite many works on adversarial crowdsourcing, there are only a few specific research studies devoted to considering the issue in the context of cyber security. In this regard, the proposed typologies (and addressed scenarios) for such human-mediated attacks can shed light on the way of identifying and confronting such threats. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this the first work in which the titular topic is investigated in detail. Due to popularity and efficiency of leveraging crowds' intelligence and efforts in a wide range of application domains, it is most likely that adversarial human-driven intentions gain more attention. In this regard, it is anticipated that the present research study can serve as a roadmap for proposing defensive mechanisms to cope with such diverse threats. Adversarial crowdsourcing.

Cybersecurity awareness training programs: a cost–benefit analysis framework. Purpose: Employees must receive proper cybersecurity training so that they can recognize the threats to their organizations and take the appropriate actions to reduce cyber risks. However, many cybersecurity awareness training (CSAT) programs fall short due to their misaligned training focuses. Design/methodology/approach: To help organizations develop effective CSAT programs, we have developed a theoretical framework for conducting a cost–benefit analysis of those CSAT programs. We differentiate them into three types of CSAT programs (constant, complementary and compensatory) by their costs and into four types of CSAT programs (negligible, consistent, increasing and diminishing) by their benefits. Also, we investigate the impact of CSAT programs with different costs and the benefits on a company's optimal degree of security. Findings: Our findings indicate that the benefit of a CSAT program with different types of cost plays a disparate role in keeping, upgrading or lowering a company's existing security level. Ideally, a CSAT program should spend more of its expenses on training employees to deal with the security threats at a lower security level and to reduce more losses at a higher security level. Originality/value: Our model serves as a benchmark that will help organizations allocate resources toward the development of successful CSAT programs. Awareness training. Benefit. Cost.

Corruption as a Cybersecurity Threat in the New World Order. The important topic of cybersecurity relative to the fight against corruption in the context of global challenges in the pandemic and post-pandemic world requires further research. The purpose of this article is to identify and analyze current and prospective cybersecurity issues in this context by applying general-scientific and special-legal methods of cogni-tion. Using the dialectical method, theoretical background, and contempo-rary views on ensuring cybersecurity served to investigate the key current challenges. Formal-legal and comparative methods allowed to recommend measures to enhance cybersecurity in view of the massive digitalization and social transformations. The authors emphasize the need to establish a national cybersecurity policy based on society’s information literacy and culture, combining respect to traditional and historical values with a mod-ern understanding of multicultural communication and well-being. corruption.

Enhancing relationships between criminology and cybersecurity. ‘Cybercrime’ is an umbrella concept used by criminologists to refer to traditional crimes that are enhanced via the use of networked technologies (i.e. cyber-enabled crimes) and newer forms of crime that would not exist without networked technologies (i.e. cyber-dependent crimes). Cybersecurity is similarly a very broad concept and diverse field of practice. For computer scientists, the term ‘cybersecurity’ typically refers to policies, processes and practices undertaken to protect data, networks and systems from unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used in subnational, national and transnational contexts to capture an increasingly diverse array of threats. Increasingly, cybercrimes are presented as threats to cybersecurity, which explains why national security institutions are gradually becoming involved in cybercrime control and prevention activities. This paper argues that the fields of cyber-criminology and cybersecurity, which are segregated at the moment, are in much need of greater engagement and cross-fertilisation. We draw on concepts of ‘high’ and ‘low’ policing (Brodeur, 2010) to suggest it would be useful to consider ‘crime’ and ‘security’ on the same continuum. This continuum has cybercrime at one end and cybersecurity at the other, with crime being more the domain of ‘low’ policing while security, as conceptualised in the context of specific cybersecurity projects, falls under the responsibility of ‘high’ policing institutions. This unifying approach helps us to explore the fuzzy relationship between cyber-crime and cyber-security and to call for more fruitful alliances between cybercrime and cybersecurity researchers.

The Core of Uncertain Coalitional Game Based on Hurwicz Criterion with Application to Cyber Security Information Sharing. The coalitional game focuses on how people share the payoffs of collaboration when they form coalitions. However, we cannot accurately obtain the different coalitions' payoffs because of the actual situation's limitation or economic and technical factors. Therefore, we have to rely on experts in the field to estimate the likelihood of various events and give their belief degrees. To deal with the belief degrees, scholars of uncertainty theory suppose the transferable payoffs to be uncertain variables and propose the uncertain coalitional game. Many expected and optimistic solution concepts have been put forward in the literature, even though the expected value criterion does not consider the decision-maker's attitude to risk, and the optimistic value criterion is too extreme. To better describe the different subjective judgments of decision-makers, the Hurwicz criterion is applied to the uncertain coalitional game, in which the players intend to maximize their Hurwicz payoffs. Besides, the method to discover the Hurwicz-core is provided, and the condition that the core is nonempty is proved. What's more, the Hurwicz-Shapley value is mathematically proven to be in the Hurwicz-core in a convex uncertain coalitional game. An application in cyber security information sharing is provided.

The Invisible COVID-19 Small Business Risks: Dealing with the Cyber-Security Aftermath. COVID-19 forced small businesses globally to move their presence online to survive. Cyber-criminals have swiftly taken advantage of the chaos wrought by this move. Due to factors ranging from small businesses' inexperience with technology to a global cyber-security skill shortage, policy-based solutions by governments are needed to help ensure that this vital sector in global economies does not fall victim to cyber-criminals. We propose and discuss three measures that governments can take to build up small business cyber-security resilience. business risks.

A Process-Based Approach to ABET Accreditation: A Case Study of a Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Program. ABET accreditation has become a well-known standard for academic programs not only in the U.S. but also across the globe. Instantiating the processes to systematically improve the quality of programs is a daunting task for higher education institutions. In this contribution, we provide a detailed process-based framework that can assist aspiring institutions to embed quality in their processes leading to ABET accreditation. Our contribution is a novel framework for a process-based approach to quality assurance, as most of the published literature is primarily concerned with the experience of ABET accreditation of a solitary program. However, in this paper, we have presented a generic framework that ABET aspiring programs can instantiate in their preparation for ABET accreditation. We have validated these processes in our successful ABET accreditation application of the Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics program. Our existing ABET-accredited programs were following old ABET criteria and the Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics program must apply based on the new criteria proposed by ABET. Another novelty of our contribution is that it is based on our work for the first application cycle for ABET cybersecurity- related programs, so the findings of our contribution may assist other aspiring cybersecurity related academic programs to well prepare in their ABET accreditation pursuits.

We conclude by offering recommendations for others developing similar courses. Copyright . Cybersecurity. General education. Instructional pedagogy. Integrative learning. 
Cybersecurity challenges in ensuring patient safety in global digital healthcare. Digital healthcare is rapidly transforming the traditional healthcare model, allowing patients to access better quality care efficiently, providing a well-rounded approach to wellbeing and health, enabling personalization, and reaching those in geographically remote areas. Due to its valuable nature, healthcare data is prone to hacks and theft, resulting in deleterious consequences for the patient. Therefore, cybersecurity and data privacy need to be managed effectively to reap the benefits of digital health. Integrated and coherent international regulations, a global data protection framework, and the use of quality management systems to ensure adherence to cybersecurity regulations and standards would be beneficial to patient safety and personal medical data security in systems that are becoming increasingly global in nature. 
Brat: A bridge attack tool for cyber security assessments of maritime systems. Today’s shipping industry is largely digitalized and networked, but by no means immune to cyber attacks. As recent incidents show, attacks, particularly those targeting on the misleading of navigation, not only pose a serious risk from an economic perspective when disrupting maritime value chains, but can also cause collisions and endanger the environment and humans. However, cyber defense has not yet been an integral part of maritime systems engineering, nor are there any automated tools to systematically assess their security level as well-established in other domains. In this paper, we therefore present a holistic BRidge Attack Tool (BRAT) that interactively offers various attack implementations targeting the communication of nautical data in maritime systems. This provides system engineers with a tool for security assessments of integrated bridge systems, enabling the identification of potential cyber vulnerabilities during the design phase. Moreover, it facilitates the development and validation of an effective cyber defense. 
A research on cyber security intrusion detection against physical access cyber attacks using open source software for smart grids. In recent years, the structure of the electricity grids has changed remarkably because of developing technology and smart grids have started to be used instead of classical ones. IEC 61850 standard is widely used in communication of smart grids. Smart grids bring additional risks along with the many benefits they provide. One of these risks is the vulnerabilities in communication systems. they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, weakening the security. There are numerous studies in the literature about the detection and the prevention of the vulnerabilities caused by the communication network. However, there are no detailed studies on the investigation and the detection of cyber-attacks that can be made through physical access to smart grids spread over a wide area. Furthermore, difficulties in validation of intrusion detection system (IDS) and a number of problems in IDSs cause vulnerabilities, which make smart grids vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this study, physical access cyber-attacks are examined and an intrusion test is done within Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Electrical Distribution Automation Laboratory, which is a modern testbed and communicates with IEC 61850 standard, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. In order to determine the physical access cyber-attacks on time and to take necessary precautions, open source software is used. It is shown that physical access cyber-attacks to smart grids can be prevented with the established testbed. Cyber Security. Cyber-Physical System. IEC 61850. Intrusion Detection System.

Cybersecurity resiliency of marine renewable energy systems part 2: Cybersecurity best practices and risk management. Marine renewable energy (MRE) is an emerging source of power for marine applications, marine devices, and coastal communities. This energy source relies on industrial control systems and IT to support operations and maintenance activities, which create a pathway for an adversary to gain unauthorized access to systems and data and disrupt operations. Incorporating cybersecurity risk prevention measures and mitigation capabilities from inception, development, operation, to decommissioning of the MRE system and components is paramount to the protection of energy generation and the security of network architecture and infrastructure. To improve the resilience of MRE systems as a predictable, affordable, and reliable source of energy, cybersecurity guidance was developed to enable operators to assess cybersecurity risks and implement security measures commensurate with the risk. This publication is the second of a two-part series, with Part 1 addressing a framework to determine cybersecurity risk by assessing the vulnerability of an MRE system to potential cyber threats and the consequences a cyberattack would have on the end user. This Part 2 publication describes an approach to select appropriate cybersecurity best practices commensurate with the MRE system’s cybersecurity risk. The guidance includes 86 cybersecurity best practices, which are associated with 36 cybersecurity domains and grouped into nine categories. The best practices follow the core functions of the National Institute of Science and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (e.g., identify, detect, protect, respond, and and recover) and insights from both maritime and energy industry guidance documents to identify security measures effective in protecting information and operational technology assets prevalent in MRE systems.

A novel intrusion mitigation unit for interconnected power systems in frequency regulation to enhance cybersecurity. Cyberattacks (CAs) on modern interconnected power systems are currently a primary concern. The development of information and communication technology (ICT) has increased the possibility of unauthorized access to power system networks for data manipulation. Unauthorized data manipulation may lead to the partial or complete shutdown of a power network. In this paper, we propose a novel security unit that mitigates intrusion for an interconnected power system and compensates for data manipulation to augment cybersecurity. The studied two-area interconnected power system is first stabilized to alleviate frequency deviation and tie-line power between the areas by designing a fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FPID) controller. Since the parameters of the FPID controller can also be influenced by a CA, the proposed security unit, named the automatic intrusion mitigation unit (AIMU), guarantees control over such changes. The effectiveness of the AIMU is inspected against a CA, load variations, and unknown noises, and the results show that the proposed unit guarantees reliable performance in all circumstances.

An integrative review and analysis of cybersecurity research current state and future directions. Advances in information technology have greatly changed communications and business transactions between firms and their customers and suppliers. As a result, cybersecurity risk attracts ever increasing attention from firms, regulators, customers, shareholders, and academics. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has released guidance on the disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents, along with potential internal control solutions, in the managers’ discussion and analysis section of 10-K annual financial reports. Despite increasing interest in cybersecurity research, the literature lacks an integrative review of existing research identifying opportunities for future cybersecurity developments. In this study, we conduct an extensive analysis of cybersecurity-related papers in the accounting, information systems, computer science, and general business disciplines. Our review integrates and classifies 68 cybersecurity papers, examines cybersecurity determinants, consequences, and remedial strategies, and identifies future research opportunities based on the current state of the literature.

Intention to share: The relationship between cybersecurity behaviour and sharing specific content in facebook. Introduction. Sharing information on Facebook is becoming increasingly popular. Sharing text, video, voice, and pictures with unique content of the language-specific and sacred text, is becoming a trend. Consequently, issues of secure and trustable content have become increasingly important to all netizens. This issue has its foundations in the intention to share behaviour where the emphasis is on user security behaviour when sharing specific content. Method. The proposed theory was adapted and modified from previous research to empirically evaluate survey data collected from 154 Facebook users. A snowball sampling method was used. Analysis. A quantitative analysis was carried out on the data, which related to 154 Facebook users. This analysis used SmartPLS software. Results. The experience of information sharing was found to be an important determinant of personal outcome expectation as it explained about 89.9 per cent of the total variance. The ability to create and share information, subjective norms, feedback, information sharing self-efficacy, personal outcome expectations, and information security behaviour have become most important factors when intending to share specific content on Facebook. Conclusions. There is a theoretical understanding of security behaviour as a factor that promotes specific-content sharing behaviour on Facebook. 
Implementation and evaluation of physical, hybrid, and virtual testbeds for cybersecurity analysis of industrial control systems. Industrial Control Systems are an essential part of our daily lives and can be found in indus-tries such as oil, utilities, and manufacturing. Rapid growth in technology has introduced industrial components with network capabilities that allow them to communicate with traditional computer networks, thus increasing their exposure to cyber-attacks. Current research on Industrial Control Systems suffer from lack of technical information as these systems are part of critical infrastructures. To overcome this, researchers have employed different types of testbeds to develop their mechanisms of cyber-attack detection and prevention. This manuscript describes, implements, and evaluates physical, hybrid, and virtual application of a clean water supply system developed for cybersecurity research. The results show that physical testbeds allow an understanding of the behaviour and dynamics of control components like sensors and actuators, which might be affected by external influences such as noise, vibration, temperature, and non-ideal device behaviour. Although, hybrid testbeds reduce the cost of implementation, they ignore the physical dynamics of the system as explained above. Virtual testbeds are the cheapest option in comparison with physical and hybrid testbeds. however, they provide a limited view of the control system operation that could have negative consequences when developing a detection/prevention system.

Designing a K-16 Cybersecurity Collaborative: CIPHER. In this article, researchers hare initial findings from the testing of a proposed framework to address the challenges in establishing a K–16 pipeline to prepare cybersecurity professionals. The goal of the initiative is to create a researcher– practitioner partnership (RPP) that paves the way for a national alliance for the development of fundamental, theoretically grounded, and systematic approaches to inclusive K–16 cybersecurity education, especially for students who have a low socio-economic status (SES). The Cybersecurity Inclusive Pathways Toward Higher Education and Research (CIPHER) model brings together scholars from multiple disciplines and practitioners from various fields to collaborate and understand the problems and to co-construct a K–16 partnership model to address those challenges. The planning phase is designed to substantially shape the development of CIPHER. This process, using a design-based implementation research (DBIR) approach, enables researchers to iteratively test ideas with stakeholders, engage with partners to co-design and test evolutions of CIPHER, and develop a model that can be implemented and scaled up with fidelity.. 
How a humanities background provides real value in cyber security. When you think of the technology industry generally, and in particular the cyber security vertical market, it often conjures up the image of hoodie-wearing software engineers working through the night, making arcane references to code. Or perhaps it's the frantic sound of typing on keyboards echoing throughout dark smoky rooms illuminated only by pale green light, possibly something reminiscent of The Matrix. The idea that only students of the hard sciences can contribute to the technology industry may prove to be detrimental to companies seeking qualified and experienced talent. By encouraging people from a liberal arts and humanities background to join the cyber security field, not only will we be driving key skills towards the industry, we will also be doing more to promote inclusivity and equality. As Trevor Morgan of comforte AG explains, every facet of the humanities has the ability to imbue future cyber security experts with critically desired soft skills. 
Looking to the future of the cyber security landscape. Last year marked a turning point in the industry as organisations accelerated their digital transformation efforts. The move towards more cloud-based tools and remote working has been dominating the conversation over recent years, but in 2020 this need was kicked into overdrive for many organisations – it was a case of innovate or be left behind. The move towards more cloud-based tools and remote working has dominated the conversation in recent years. But in 2020 this need was kicked into overdrive. The acceleration of digital transformation has reinforced the importance of cyber security and brought into focus the need to manage and secure against remote devices and threats. Rashid Ali of Wallix explains how businesses need to ensure they have complete control and visibility of all company data, while supporting employee productivity. 
Association Analysis-Based Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for Industrial Control Systems. With the adoption of various information and communication technologies and commercial off-the-shelf components, industrial control systems (ICSs) become highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment (CSRA) plays a vital role in the security protection of ICSs. To reduce the complexity of the modeling process in the dynamic CSRA, an association analysis-based CSRA approach is proposed in this article. It designs a three-layer association network (AN) to infer the probabilities of security incidents. The parameters of the AN are derived through mining the data of historical attack records. From a distance correlation analysis of the process data of the target system, an association matrix is obtained between the system state variables and the key security variables to quantify the cybersecurity risk of the system. A case study is conducted on a coupling tanks control system to demonstrate the effectiveness and timeliness of the proposed approach.

An Actuarial Framework for Power System Reliability Considering Cybersecurity Threats. Cybersecurity has become an emerging issue for the secure operation of power systems. Besides hardening the power system to improve its cybersecurity, cyber insurance is emerging as a promising tool in cyber risk management. In this paper, an actuarial framework is established to capture and reduce the riskiness raised by interdependence among cyber risks, with the aim to enhance cyber insurance market for power systems. Absorbing semi-Markov process (SMP) is proposed to model the cyberattacks on the power grid. Also a stochastic model is developed to reflect the correlation of cyber risks across the power system. A sequential Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) framework is developed to evaluate the interruptions of the power system considering both the physical failures of the components and malicious cyberattacks. Then, the detailed insurance schemes are designed to manage the risks of the power system considering the financial consequences of cybersecurity threats. Case studies are conducted on a test system based on the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS-79) to illustrate the application of the proposed insurance pricing schemes.

Cyber risk propagation and optimal selection of cybersecurity controls for complex cyberphysical systems. The increasingly witnessed integration of information technology with operational technology leads to the formation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that intertwine physical and cyber components and connect to each other to form systems-of-systems. This interconnection enables the offering of functionality beyond the combined offering of each individual component, but at the same time increases the cyber risk of the overall system, as such risk propagates between and aggregates at component systems. The complexity of the resulting systems-of-systems in many cases leads to difficulty in analyzing cyber risk. Additionally, the selection of cybersecurity controls that will effectively and efficiently treat the cyber risk is commonly performed manually, or at best with limited automated decision support. In this work, we propose a method for analyzing risk propagation and aggregation in complex CPSs utilizing the results of risk assessments of their individual constituents. Additionally, we propose a method employing evolutionary programming for automating the selection of an optimal set of cybersecurity controls out of a list of available controls, that will minimize the residual risk and the cost associated with the implementation of these measures. We illustrate the workings of the proposed methods by applying them to the navigational systems of two variants of the Cyber-Enabled Ship (C-ES), namely the autonomous ship and the remotely controlled ship. The results are sets of cybersecurity controls applied to those components of the overall system that have been identified in previous studies as the most vulnerable ones. such controls minimize the residual risk, while also minimizing the cost of implementation.

Cybersecurity: The need for data and patient safety with cardiac implantable electronic devices. Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has become routine practice as a result of the advances in biomedical engineering, the advent of interconnectivity between the devices through the Internet, and the demonstrated improvement in patient outcomes, survival, and hospitalizations. However, this increased dependency on the Internet of Things comes with risks in the form of cybersecurity lapses and possible attacks. Although no cyberattack leading to patient harm has been reported to date, the threat is real and has been demonstrated in research laboratory scenarios and echoed in patient concerns. The CIED universe comprises a complex interplay of devices, connectivity protocols, and sensitive information flow between the devices and the central cloud server. Various manufacturers use proprietary software and black-box connectivity protocols that are susceptible to hacking. Here we discuss the fundamentals of the CIED ecosystem, the potential security vulnerabilities, a historical overview of such vulnerabilities reported in the literature, and recommendations for improving the security of the CIED ecosystem and patient safety.

Comprehensive fault simulation method in active distribution network with the consideration of cyber security. With the many characteristics of cyber–physical systems (CPS), including the complex evolution of various dynamic processes in distribution networks (DNs), communication modes and serious network security events have become important issues. From the perspective of DN analysis, traditional electrical digital simulations cannot access current models of communication systems and cyber network security events. The interactions between cyber and physical networks cannot be simulated and analysed simultaneously, which is challenging to the development of CPS simulations of DNs. To evaluate the impact of cyber networks on physical networks, a CPS simulation platform that contains physical, communication and control layers is discussed. Three-phase short-circuit fault processing and islanding operation control are simulated by data interactions among three-layer models that are used to analyse the impact of communication data tampering on fault handling processes. The influence of data tampering on fault processing and the influence of false data injection and data interception on islanding operation control processes are analysed. The simulation results show that the network information security has a large impact on fault protection and islanding operation control, which leads to the expansion of the outage scope and the failure of islanding operation frequency adjustment. This article also provides a simulation basis for the analysis of CPS operation characteristics and the identification and prevention of cyber network security events. 
Cybersecurity knowledge and skills taught in capture the flag challenges. Capture the Flag challenges are a popular form of cybersecurity education, where students solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting. The tasks feature diverse assignments, such as exploiting websites, cracking passwords, and breaching unsecured networks. However, it is unclear how the skills practiced by these challenges match formal cybersecurity curricula defined by security experts. We explain the significance of Capture the Flag challenges in cybersecurity training and analyze their 15,963 textual solutions collected since 2012. Based on keywords in the solutions, we map them to well-established ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines to understand which skills the challenges teach. We study the distribution of cybersecurity topics, their variance in different challenge formats, and their development over the past years. The analysis showed the prominence of technical knowledge about cryptography and network security, but human aspects, such as social engineering and cybersecurity awareness, are neglected. We discuss the implications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our results indicate that future Capture the Flag challenges should include non-technical aspects to address the current advanced cyber threats and attract a broader audience to cybersecurity.

Risk-averse bi-level stochastic network interdiction model for cyber-security risk management. This paper proposes a methodology to enable a risk-averse, resource constrained cyber network defender to optimally deploy security countermeasures that protect against potential attackers with an uncertain budget. The proposed methodology is based on a risk-averse bi-level stochastic network interdiction model on an attack graph–maps the potential attack paths of a cyber network–that minimizes the weighted sum of the expected maximum loss over all attack scenarios and the risk of substantially large losses. The conditional-value-at-risk measure is incorporated into the stochastic programming model to reduce the risk of substantially large losses. An exact algorithm is developed to solve the model as well as several acceleration techniques to improve the computational efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the acceleration techniques enable the solution of relatively large problems within a reasonable amount of time: simultaneously applying all the acceleration techniques reduces the average computation time of the basic algorithm by 71% for 100-node graphs. Using metrics called mean-risk value of stochastic solution and value of risk-aversion, computational results suggest that the stochastic risk-averse model provides substantially better network interdiction decision than the deterministic (ignores uncertainty) and risk-neutral models when 1) the distribution of attacker budget is heavy-right-tailed and 2) the defender is highly risk-averse.

Cyber security threat modeling in the AEC industry: An example for the commissioning of the built environment. Digitalization and automation are making the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Existing literature suggests that industry-specific studies need to be conducted. The work presented in this study shows a preliminary cybersecurity threat model relevant to the AEC industry. To that end, threat models for each of the life cycle phases are proposed. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the commissioning phase of a building, which includes an autonomous robotic system to collect data as a possible countermeasure. The suggested countermeasure shows promise to address some of the cybersecurity challenges faced in the building certification and commissioning process. The results show that the likelihood of detecting rogue sensors increases with additional constraints in the monitoring robot, such as minimum and maximum distance. The illustrative models suggest that the proposed framework will help to address the safety and cyber security of stakeholders and systems during crucial phases of construction projects.

Understanding cybersecurity behavioral habits: Insights from situational support. While the Internet has become an indispensable aspect of personal and professional lives, it has also served to render many individuals vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Thus, the promotion of cybersecurity behaviors can effectively protect individuals from these threats. However, cybersecurity behaviors do not necessarily come naturally, and people need support and encouragement to develop and adopt them. A habit is an important factor that may motivate cybersecurity behaviors, but it has often been overlooked in past studies. To address this limitation, this study examined the formation of cybersecurity behavioral habits. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze cybersecurity behavior survey data obtained from 393 college student participants. The results revealed the following: (1) efficacy and behavioral comprehensiveness predict cybersecurity behavioral habits. (2) efficacy has a positively impact on behavioral comprehensiveness. (3) situational support has a positive influence on efficacy. These findings suggest that cybersecurity behavioral habits can be formed by promoting the diversity of cybersecurity measures practiced (behavioral comprehensiveness) and efficacy. behavioral comprehensiveness. behavioral habit. cybersecurity. response efficacy. self-efficacy. situational support. 
Cyber security in smart cities: A review of deep learning-based applications and case studies. On the one hand, smart cities have brought about various changes, aiming to revolutionize people's lives. On the other hand, while smart cities bring better life experiences and great convenience to people's lives, there are more hidden dangers of cyber security, including information leakage and malicious cyber attacks. The current cyber security development cannot keep up with the eager adoption of global smart city technologies so correct design based on deep learning methods is essential to protect smart city cyber. This paper summarizes the knowledge and interpretation of Smart Cities (SC), Cyber Security (CS), and Deep Learning (DL) concepts as well as discussed existing related work on IoT security in smart cities. Specifically, we briefly reviewed several deep learning models, including Boltzmann machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. Then we introduced cyber security applications and use cases based on deep learning technology in smart cities. Finally, we describe the future development trend of smart city cyber security.

A lightweight cyber security framework with context-awareness for pervasive computing environments. Internet of things (IoT) plays a key role in enabling smart sustainable cities. Pervasive computing over the IoT platform makes life more convenient by embedding sensors based on context-aware computing devices in the physical environment for the ubiquitous availability of computing resources. The sensors gather contextual information from the physical world and transmit it to receivers as per requirements or in case of environmental changes, such as temperature and humidity. However, the combination of dynamic operation and the need to handle sensitive and private data make the pervasive computing environment and IoT devices vulnerable to numerous attacks. Smart environments require a maximum level of safety assurance, such as trusted context producers and customers, which should protect sensitive information from exposure or monitoring. This paper discusses the major cyber threats in smart environments and proposes a novel lightweight security framework that authenticates and maintains the context providers and receivers. The cloud environment is adopted for user authentication at the user layer to implement access control and role assignment. Finally, the proposed security framework is implemented in the IBM cloud platform with six devices to evaluate its efficiency, sustainability, and secure communication. Context-aware. Cyber security.

Cybersecurity risks disclosure and implied audit risks: Evidence from audit fees. This study examines the association between companies' cybersecurity risk disclosures and audit fees. Based on a sample from 2005 to 2018, we find that companies' audit fees are not only influenced by the content (number of words), but also by the language (readability and litigious language) disclosed in their cybersecurity risk disclosures. We extend prior studies and find that audit firms assess audit risks not just by evaluating actual cyber breach incidents, but also the cybersecurity risks disclosures more generally. The implication is that the auditor incorporates into their risk assessments, and accordingly their fee structures, the nature and content of cybersecurity risk disclosures. In general, more readable disclosures can reduce audit fees and perhaps other monitoring costs incurred by SEC registrants. audit fees. audit risk. cybersecurity key words. cybersecurity risk disclosures. readability. text analytics. use of litigious language. 
Design Guidelines for Machine Learning-based Cybersecurity in Internet of Things. Cybersecurity is one of the building blocks in need of increasing attention in Internet of things (IoT) applications. IoT has become a popular target for attackers seeking sensitive and personal user data, computing infrastructure for massive attacks, or aimed at compromising critical applications. Worryingly, the industrial race toward the forefront of IoT software and device development has led to increased market penetration of vulnerable IoT devices and applications. Nevertheless, traditional cybersecurity solutions designed for personal computers often rely on heavy computation and high communication overhead, and therefore are prohibitive for IoT, given the explosive number of IoT devices, their resource-con-strained nature, and their heterogeneity. Hence, innovative solutions must be designed for securing IoT applications, while considering the peculiar characteristics of IoT devices and networks. In this article, we discuss the motivations and challenges of using machine learning (ML) models for the design of cybersecurity solutions for IoT. More specifically, we tackle the challenge of designing ML-based solutions and provide guidelines for ML-based physical layer solutions aimed at securing IoT. We propose a device-oriented and network-oriented classification and investigate recent works that designed ML-based solutions, considering IoT physical layer features, to secure IoT applications. The proposed classification helps engineers and practitioners starting in this area to better identify and understand the challenges, requirements, and up-to-date common design principles for securing IoT devices and networks considering physical layer features. Finally, we shed light on some future research directions that need further investigation. 
Port cybersecurity and threat: A structural model for prevention and policy development. Most port operators have increasingly integrated cybertechnology into port activities to increase their competitiveness. unfortunately, this digitalization becomes the major vulnerability for the emerging cyberthreat. To help port policymakers develop cybersecurity measures, this study conceptualized and developed three dimensions of port cybersecurity hygiene (i.e. human, infrastructure, and procedure factors) and investigated the relationships between port cybersecurity hygiene and cyberthreats (i.e. hacktivism, cyber criminality, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism, and cyber war). A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from all international container port operators and shipping lines with branches in Thailand, and the proposed relationships were tested by structural equation modeling. The results indicated that container ports tended to encounter hacktivism when their human, infrastructure, and procedure factors were vulnerable. The weakness of the human factor could also lead to cyber terrorism, while the deficiency of the infrastructure factor could lead to cyber criminality. Moreover, container ports were likely to be harmed by cyber espionage if their procedure factor was poorly implemented. Hence, the provision of training and education to all port workers, including top executives, managers, and supervisors, are necessary to ensure a cyberthreat-awareness culture at all organizational levels. Improving cybersecurity equipment could prevent unauthorized access to port business data and keep important information secure, while the ISPS Code-based procedures and other preventive measures should be strictly implemented by container ports to reduce the risk of cyberthreats.

Cybersecurity Issues in Wireless Sensor Networks: Current Challenges and Solutions. Wireless sensor networks are deployed without predefined infrastructure and are generally left unattended. Indeed, the vulnerability of the wireless sensor networks to attacks comes principally from their inherent characteristics. As the data are transmitted over the air, it is very easy for an adversary to spy on traffic. Also, to meet the strict budgetary requirements, the sensor nodes tend to not be tamperproof and thus offer no protection against security attacks. Alongside with these vulnerabilities, the human intervention is always not allowed to deal with adversaries who attempt to compromise the network. Therefore, security systems are mainly needed to secure the network and ensure the protection against security threats. Indeed, cryptographic based systems are generally used to ensure security. However, due to the lack of memory and power (low computing, limited energy reserves) of the sensor nodes, most of these approaches are not suitable. Therefore, providing security while respecting the specific constraints of the sensors, represents one of the most important research issue in wireless sensor networks. Indeed, several studies have been conducted these last decades to propose lightweight and efficient security protocols for wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we review the most leading protocols and classify them based the addressed security issue. Also, we outline the main security constraints and challenges and present the future research directions based on the emerged application fields. Cybersecurity. Intrusion detection system.

Modelling Information and Communications Technology Cyber Security Externalities Spillover Effects on Sustainable Economic Growth. This study aims to model information and communications technology (ICT) cybersecurity negative externalities spillover effects on sustainable economic growth. Three productivity frameworks and models were developed to measure ICT cybersecurity negative externalities spillover effects on sustainable economic growth. An econometric and growth account combined model was developed to estimate the explanatory variables. The involved coefficients have been estimated to cast reservation on growth account approach results produced that ignored variables’ parameter estimation that reveals the consistency of the results produced in the first step. On the other hand, in the second step, the modified model calculates productivity indicators ignored by econometric approach studies. The doubt on the results generated by both approaches has been overcame via developing the combined models into two steps growth accounting approach that provides parametric solutions and econometric approach gap that has been filled in the second step that calculates productivity indicators. The most significant contribution of this study is treating ICT cybersecurity’s negative externality spillover effects similar to the negative externalities generated by pollutants’ emissions and developing capital productivity framework and model that were unnoticed in most of the studies.

Integration Technology of Functional Safety and Cyber Security for Nuclear Safety Class DCS [核安全级DCS功能安全与信息安全权衡技术]. Taking the typical nuclear safety class DCS as an example, the FMVEA technology is used to evaluate the compatibility between functional safety and cyber security. The combination of event tree and risk analysis is used to give functional safety and cyber security coordination solutions, and finally obtain the integrated protective measures of nuclear safety class DCS functional safety and cyber security. The results show that the application of trade-off technology to obtain the cyber security measures can be better compatible with the original functional safety measures. Therefore, the trade-off techniques established in this study can be applied to nuclear safety class DCS cyber security design work. Cyber security. Event tree. FMVEA. Functional safety.

An efficient and accurate depth‐wise separable convolutional neural network for cybersecurity vulnerability assessment based on captcha breaking. Cybersecurity practitioners generate a Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) as a form of security mechanism in website applications, in order to differentiate between human end‐users and machine bots. They tend to use standard security to implement CAPTCHAs in order to prevent hackers from writing malicious automated programs to make false website registrations and to restrict them from stealing end‐users’ private information. Among the categories of CAPTCHAs, the text‐based CAPTCHA is the most widely used. However, with the evolution of deep learning, it has been so dramatic that tasks previously thought not easily addressable by computers and used as CAPTCHA to prevent spam are now possible to break. The workflow of CAPTCHA breaking is a combination of efforts, approaches, and the development of the computation‐efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that attempts to increase accuracy. In this study, in contrast to breaking the whole CAPTCHA images simultaneously, this study split four‐character CAPTCHA images for the individual characters with a 2‐pixel margin around the edges of a new training dataset, and then proposed an efficient and accurate Depth‐wise Separable Convolutional Neural Network for breaking text‐based CAP‐ TCHAs. Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first CAPTCHA breaking study to use the Depth‐wise Separable Convolution layer to build an efficient CNN model to break text-based CAPTCHAs. We have evaluated and compared the performance of our proposed model to that of fine‐tuning other popular CNN image recognition architectures on the generated CAPTCHA image dataset. In real‐time, our proposed model used less time to break the text‐based CAPTCHAs with an accuracy of more than 99% on the testing dataset. We observed that our proposed CNN model has efficiently improved the CAPTCHA breaking accuracy and streamlined the structure of the CAPTCHA breaking network as compared to other CAPTCHA breaking techniques.

Business organization security strategies to cyber security threats. It is argued that the advancement of Information, Communication and Technology went hand in hand with the emergence of certain threats and vulnerabilities to cybersecurity. In several cases, cyber attacks have targeted the information, communication and infrastructure networks of numerous organizations. Today, hackers and intruders have advanced technology within their scope that lets them access the organizational information system. The present study highlights numerous internet security related problems, it offers a broad-based overview of internet threats from the perspective of business enterprises, along with prevention measures and enhanced safety strategies. A systematic analysis of secondary literature was introduced by researchers, the study found that it is critical for organizations to choose an IT security management tool that can be categorized as best practices and standards. The Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) framework is one key instrument proposed here. SIEM instruments help security analysts gain insight into the security threats targeting the IT structures of a given organization. Business organizations. Cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity.

The ontological politics of cyber security: Emerging agencies, actors, sites, and spaces. In this article, we show how Annemarie Mol's notion of ontological politics helps to open up the research agenda for cyber security in Critical Security Studies. The article hence seeks to further the debate about STS and Critical Security Studies. The article's main claim is that the concept of ontological politics enables an engagement with the complex and transformative dynamics of ICT and the new security actors and practices that shape security politics in the digital age. By examining the virulent attacks executed by the Mirai botnet - one of the world's largest, fiercest, and most enduring botnets - we point to four aspects of cyber security that attention to the ontological politics of cyber security attunes us to: the proliferation and entanglement of security agencies, actors, sites, and spaces. These aspects of cyber security, we argue, are becoming increasingly prominent alongside the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G network technology. In conclusion, we discuss the wider security theoretical and normative-democratic implications of an engagement with the ontological politics of security by exploring three avenues for additional conversation between ontological politics and Critical Security Studies.

Physical Safety and Cyber Security Analysis of Multi-Agent Systems: A Survey of Recent Advances. Multi-agent systems (MASs) are typically composed of multiple smart entities with independent sensing, communication, computing, and decision-making capabilities. Nowadays, MASs have a wide range of applications in smart grids, smart manufacturing, sensor networks, and intelligent transportation systems. Control of the MASs are often coordinated through information interaction among agents, which is one of the most important factors affecting coordination and cooperation performance. However, unexpected physical faults and cyber attacks on a single agent may spread to other agents via information interaction very quickly, and thus could lead to severe degradation of the whole system performance and even destruction of MASs. This paper is concerned with the safety/security analysis and synthesis of MASs arising from physical faults and cyber attacks, and our goal is to present a comprehensive survey on recent results on fault estimation, detection, diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of MASs, and cyber attack detection and secure control of MASs subject to two typical cyber attacks. Finally, the paper concludes with some potential future research topics on the security issues of MASs.

Cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management: An overview and future research directions. Technological applications have increasingly improved the quality of services in the logistics industry. However, the adoption of internet-based technologies has increased the attack surface in the logistics environment. Such attacks could negatively impact both logistics and overall supply chain performance. This paper reviews studies on measures that enhance cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management. Several key findings and potential research directions are presented in relation to research on cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management. These findings are: (1) Existing studies rarely use real cybersecurity data. (2) Studies focusing on cybersecurity in logistics are scarce although logistics plays an important role in supply chains. (3) There is only a limited number of papers adopting quantitative research approaches to study cybersecurity in logistics and supply chain management. (4) While a few studies focus on real-time recovery and aftermath measures, most studies focus on precautionary measures. (5) Blockchain technologies are still in their infancy in the transport and logistics sector. (6) Most studies use one-way encryption schemes that overlook the potential threats in a future dominated by quantum computing techniques. (7) Studies on information security and digital forensic investigation are scarce. Blockchain. Cybersecurity. Defensive measures. IoT. Logistics. Supply chain. 
Using Event-Based Method to Estimate Cybersecurity Equilibrium. Estimating the global state of a networked system is an important problem in many application domains. The classical approach to tackling this problem is the periodic (observation) method, which is inefficient because it often observes states at a very high frequency. This inefficiency has motivated the idea of event-based method, which leverages the evolution dynamics in question and makes observations only when some rules are triggered (i.e., only when certain conditions hold). This paper initiates the investigation of using the event-based method to estimate the equilibrium in the new application domain of cybersecurity, where equilibrium is an important metric that has no closed-form solutions. More specifically, the paper presents an event-based method for estimating cybersecurity equilibrium in the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics, which has been proven globally convergent. The presented study proves that the estimated equilibrium from our trigger rule i) indeed converges to the equilibrium of the dynamics and ii) is Zeno-free, which assures the usefulness of the event-based method. Numerical examples show that the event-based method can reduce 98% of the observation cost incurred by the periodic method. In order to use the event-based method in practice, this paper investigates how to bridge the gap between i) the continuous state in the dynamics model, which is dubbed probability-state because it measures the probability that a node is in the secure or compromised state, and ii) the discrete state that is often encountered in practice, dubbed sample-state because it is sampled from some nodes. This bridge may be of independent value because probability-state models have been widely used to approximate exponentially-many discrete state systems.

Actual TDoA-based augmentation system for enhancing cybersecurity in ADS-B. Currently, cybersecurity and cyber resilience are emerging and urgent issues in next-generation air traffic surveillance systems, which depend primarily on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) owing to its low cost and high accuracy. Unfortunately, ADS-B is prone to cyber-attacks. To verify the ADS-B positioning data of aircraft, multilateration (MLAT) techniques that use Time Differences of Arrivals (TDoAs) have been proposed. MLAT exhibits low accuracy in determining aircraft positions. Recently, a novel technique using a theoretically calculated TDoA fingerprint map has been proposed. This technique is less dependent on the geometry of sensor deployment and achieves better accuracy than MLAT. However, the accuracy of the existing technique is not sufficiently precise for determining aircraft positions and requires a long computation time. In contrast, this paper presents a reliable surveillance framework using an Actual TDoA-Based Augmentation System (ATBAS). It uses historically recorded real-data from the OpenSky network to train our TDoA fingerprint grid network. Our results show that the accuracy of the proposed ATBAS framework in determining the aircraft positions is significantly better than those of the MLAT and expected TDoA techniques by 56.93% and 48.86%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed framework reduced the computation time by 77% compared with the expected TDoA technique. ADS-B. Cyber resilience. Cybersecurity. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier.

Steganography and Steganalysis (in digital forensics): a Cybersecurity guide. Steganography and steganalysis is a relatively new-fangled scientific discipline in security systems and digital forensics, respectively, but one that has matured greatly over the past two decades. In any specialism of human endeavour, it is imperative to periodically pause and review the state of the discipline for what has been achieved till date. This article scrutinizes where the discipline of steganography and steganalysis at this point in time in context to the common user and new researchers in terms of current trends. Also, what has been accomplished in order to critically examine what has been done well and what ought to be done better. The state-of-the-art techniques for steganography and steganalysis (image and video) have been deliberated for the last 5 years literature. Further, the paper also takes stock the dataset and tools available for multimedia steganography and steganalysis with the examples where steganography has been used in real-life. It is a corpus of the author’s opinion and the viewpoints of different other researchers and practitioners, working in this discipline. Additionally, experiments were done using image steganography techniques to analyse the recent trends. This survey is intended to provide a complete guide for common people and new researchers and scholars approaching this field, sight on the existing and the future of steganography and steganalysis.

User values and the development of a cybersecurity public policy for the IoT. Public administrators, entrusted to develop public policy to manage the growing complexities of the IoT, face significant challenges. The challenges exist because of three reasons. First, there is a lack of policy direction. Second, user values related to cybersecurity are not well understood. Third, there is a lack of clarity as to how IoT public policy should be developed. In this paper we argue that new IoT policy should be guided by key stakeholder values (i.e. what users think to be important). We utilize the Public Value Forum to elicit public values to inform decision-making surrounding IoT policy by public administrators, conceptually informed by Rational choice theory. We use a five-phase process to introduce the decision context (i.e. the policy problem), define fundamental objectives, rank these objectives, identify value-based trade-offs between them and construct a multi-attribute utility model. The findings indicate several key themes for IoT security from the citizens themselves and decision-making administrators in diverse public agencies developing IoT cybersecurity public policy.

Attack and defense in the layered cyber-security model and their (1 ± ϵ)-approximation schemes. Let M=(T,C,P) be a security model, where T is a rooted tree, C is a multiset of costs and P is a multiset of prizes and let (T,c,p) be a security system, where c and p are bijections of costs and prizes. The problems of computing an optimal attack on a security system and of determining an edge e∈E(T) such that the maximum sum of prizes obtained from an optimal attack in (T,c,p) is minimized when c(e)=∞ are considered. An O(G2n)-time algorithm to compute an optimal attack as well as an O(G2n2)-time algorithm to determine such an edge are given, in addition to a (1-ϵ) FPTAS with the time bound [Formula presented] and a (1+ϵ) FPTAS with the time bound [Formula presented] for the first and second problems, respectively.

Ambidextrous Cybersecurity: The Seven Pillars (7Ps) of Cyber Resilience. Organizational ambidexterity balances exploitative and exploratory behaviors so that organizations are able to exploit their existing competencies while simultaneously exploring new opportunities. Similarly, ambidextrous cybersecurity (AMBI-CYBER) focuses on the protection of data, systems, and networks, while fostering the rapid introduction of new technologies within a company. This balance is linked to cybersecurity absorptive capacity and defines the 'Cybersecurity Efficient Frontier.' In this paper, we view AMBI-CYBER as a combination of organizational as well as technological and cultural competences which rely upon a multifaceted, multimodal, multinodal, and multilevel set of skills and capabilities. We outline the anatomy of the AMBI-CYBER architecture adopting a balanced scorecard, multistage approach under a 7Ps stage gate model (Patient, Persistent, Persevering, Proactive, Predictive, Preventive, and Preemptive). Such an approach emphasizes the need to enable a complex, nonlinear, adaptive process of dynamic intangible organizational assets, resources, and capabilities across a performance frontier where we aim to optimize safety, security, and privacy effectiveness and efficiency. We also suggests that the Quadruple/Quintuple Helix Innovation model may promote AMBI-CYBER enabling a locus-centric and triple-bottom-line-centric entrepreneurial process of discovery followed by development, exploration, exploitation, and deployment.

Merging Datasets of CyberSecurity Incidents for Fun and Insight. Providing an adequate assessment of their cyber-security posture requires companies and organisations to collect information about threats from a wide range of sources. One of such sources is history, intended as the knowledge about past cyber-security incidents, their size, type of attacks, industry sector and so on. Ideally, having a large enough dataset of past security incidents, it would be possible to analyze it with automated tools and draw conclusions that may help in preventing future incidents. Unfortunately, it seems that there are only a few publicly available datasets of this kind that are of good quality. The paper reports our initial efforts in collecting all publicly available security incidents datasets, and building a single, large dataset that can be used to draw statistically significant observations. In order to argue about its statistical quality, we analyze the resulting combined dataset against the original ones. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the combined dataset and compare our results with the existing literature. Finally, we present our findings, discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, and point out interesting research directions.

Design and evaluation for cybersecurity incident handling exercise considering interorganizational communication. In this paper we describe design and evaluation for cybersecurity incident handling exercise considering interorganizational communication. Interorganizational cooperation is necessary to handling cybersecurity incident. But interorganizational cooperation has difficulty because goal or role, culture are different and it makes communication gap between organization. We developed a scenario based exercise that can understand difference of organization goal and decrease a communication gap. We also developed a sustainable mechanism to retake an exercise continually because attendee can not take known scenario. Experiment result shows our exercise decrease a communication gap and make incident handling faster. 
An IoT-focused intrusion detection system approach based on preprocessing characterization for cybersecurity datasets. Security in IoT networks is currently mandatory, due to the high amount of data that has to be handled. These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks.

Soft and hard law in times of crisis: budget monitoring, migration and cybersecurity. European integration is associated with the idea of an ‘ever closer Union’, achieved in part through ‘integration-through-crisis’. However, while crises have led to higher regulatory pressure, responses to these crises have not always taken the form of stronger commitments and legally binding rules. Based on the study of three policy areas recently affected by crises, this article aims at analysing why in one of these policies (migration) more soft rules have been adopted, while the two other policies have evolved towards a greater use of hard law (budget monitoring, cybersecurity). Three potential explanations are analysed: the intensity of crises impacting political systems. the quality of prior norms and their (perceived) implementation. the entrepreneurship and heterogeneity of the coalition. Although all of these factors have explanatory powers, the capacity of policy entrepreneurs to build a large coalition appears to be the central explanation. cybersecurity. EMU.

An Alternate Vision: China's Cybersecurity Law and Its Implementation in the Chinese Courts. China's 2017 Cybersecurity Law (CSL), one of the first comprehensive cybersecurity laws by a major power, drew attention for its ambitious, all-encompassing approach to managing cybersecurity from the top down. The CSL also reflected China's efforts to respond to its citizens' demands for consumer protections, data privacy, and data security. However, when the CSL was implemented, ambiguity surrounded its interpretation and enforcement. This is the first detailed study of the Chinese judicial system's treatment of the CSL to date-by examining a sample of administrative, criminal, and civil cases, this Note showcases the on-the-ground realities of the CSL's implementation. These cases reveal that strengthened legal protections for consumers may come at the cost of eliminating anonymity. The CSL has increased the State's ability to monitor the citizenry and enforce the State's restrictive vision of cybersecurity, with impacts on both individuals and businesses. Most significantly, the State is using the CSL to target politically sensitive and anti-government speech. This trend is particularly worrying as China's role as an exporter of technology and cyber policy continues to grow. 
Cybersecurity in Next Generation Energy Grids: Challenges and Opportunities for Blockchain and AI Technologies. Renewable energy sources and the increasing interest in green energy has been the driving force behind many innovations in the energy sector, such as how utility companies interact with their customers and vice versa. The introduction of smart grids is one of these innovations in what is basically a fusion between the traditional energy grid with the IT sector. Even though this new combination brings a plethora of advantages, it also comes with an increase of the attack surface of the energy grid, which becomes susceptible to cyberattacks. In this work, we analyse the emerging cybersecurity challenges and how these could be alleviated by the advancements in AI and blockchain technologies. AI. Blockchain. Consensus algorithms.

Comparing Cybersecurity Information Exchange Models and Standards for the Common Secure Information Management Framework. Cyber threats have increased in spite of formal economic integration in the world. Decision-makers and authorities need to respond to the growing challenge of cyberthreats by increasing cooperation. Information is one of the main facilities when the objective is to prevent hybrid threats at EU level and between the western countries. The main purpose of the study is to find out separating and combining factors concerning existing cyber information sharing models and information management frameworks in western countries. The aim is also to find out crucial factors, which affect the utilization of a common Early Warning System for the ECHO stakeholders. The main findings are that unclear allocation of responsibilities in national government departments prevents authorities from fighting together against cyber and physical threats. Responsibilities for developing cybersecurity have been shared among too many developers. Operational work concerning cyber threat prevention between European public safety authorities should be more standardized, with more centralized information management system. When the purpose is to protect the critical infrastructure of society, public safety organizations in European Union member states need proactive features and continuous risk management in their information systems. The sharing of responsibilities for standardization concerning information management systems and cyber emergency procedures between authorities and international organizations is unclear.

Cooperation amidst competition: cybersecurity partnership in the US financial services sector. The US Financial Services Sector (FSS) is commonly regarded as one of the most successful in addressing cybersecurity through public-private partnership and as a potential model for less advanced sectors. However, how well the sector has actually fared remains poorly understood. Based on publicly available material and in-depth interviews with those intimately involved in business-government collaboration on cybersecurity in the FSS, we analyze how and why collaboration evolved into its current form. We find that considerable gaps remain, which both reveal limitations in the current policy framework for the FSS and suggest lessons for other critical infrastructure sectors. critical infrastructure. cybersecurity. financial services. public-private partnership. 
Interorganizational Information Sharing: Collaboration during Cybersecurity Threats. Information sharing is examined to determine if the willingness to share information relates to the willingness to collaborate in interorganizational actions used to address cybersecurity threats. This study employs ANOVA by placing 85 organizational representatives that participated in a cyber terrorism training exercise into two categories: higher versus lower willingness to share information. The dependent measures in this study are proxies for collaboration measured by willingness to seek assistance from other organizations and willingness to offer assistance to other organizations. There is a significant statistical difference between the two categorizations of organizational representatives. The category that had a lower tendency to share information also had a lower willingness to collaborate with other organizations. This research shows that sharing information is critical when collaborative interorganizational action is required to face cybersecurity threats. Managers of organizations that respond to cybersecurity threats should promote the tendency to share information with other organizations that have the resources to aid in addressing the threat. Organizations involved in cybersecurity threats that are willing to share information are more willing to participate in integrative interorganizational efforts. This study includes a sample of actual decision makers of organizations that would handle cybersecurity attacks in their community. In this study, we demonstrate the role of information sharing for enhancing integrative, collaborative action in a time where promoting this type of action is imperative to cybersecurity initiatives.

Societal Impacts of Cyber Security Assets of Project ECHO. Solutions on both consumer and state levels have become increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks by e.g. malware, phishing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. As the adoption and integration of information technologies are increasing and solutions are developing, the need to invest in cyber-security is at an all-time high. Investment in cybersecurity is a chief priority within the European Union, and project ECHO is a one initiative that put emphasis on devising, elaborating, implementing and enhancing a series of technological solutions (assets) to counteract cyber-attacks. The research problem of this study is what societal impacts do the ECHO assets have as product, as knowledge use, and as benefits to society. The literature review includes theory and practice from academic papers, EU innovation project and professional reports, and some ECHO project workflows. Relevant academic theoretical approaches that provide a basis for this task are: E-skills and training, Organisational Learning (OL), Societal Impact (SI), Societal Impact Assessment (SIA). This is a qualitative pilot study that evaluates the usefulness of employing a Product/ Knowledge/ Benefit Societal Impact framework to assessment of societal impacts. Data collection involved qualitative participatory observation of a co-creative expert hackathon workshop. This pilot study shows that the methodology path, where societal impact of ICT and AI solutions (e.g. the ECHO assets) are examined as these three elements (product, knowledge use, societal benefit). This pilot study serves as a step to validate this path and design and select practical, rigorous and relevant quantitative methodology to further the understanding of both societal impact assessment of cyber, e-, and AI-based solutions and services. To incorporate societal impacts with cyber and e-skills this study recommends developing and refining actual key performance indicators (KPI) to provide a basis for rigorous and relevant qualitative and quantitative questionnaire based inquiry of cyber, e-, and AI-based solutions and services.

CYBERSECURITY: THE ENDGAME–PART TWO. In Part One, the conversation between the sisters and the origin story of controls revealed how errors in assumptions, use of wrong math and method–compounded by complexity, and uncertainty created structural flaws in cybersecurity. Recall, a structural flaw is about design, whether a business process or a building. Better implementation/construction, maintenance or bandage solutions cannot fix a structural flaw. Part One analyzed the first of four structural flaws in cybersecurity–controls. These flaws churn cyber pros, CISOs and senior managers. These flaws are more dangerous in an era of cyberwarfare. Part One then described how to review controls to determine which to keep, fix or eliminate. The opportunity is to achieve more efficient and effective security–with less waste, distraction, and false sense of security. In Part Two, we diagnose three more structural flaws–lines of defense, frameworks and insider threats. The emphasis continues on structural flaws that cannot be fixed by better implementation, working longer hours or tweaking. Instead, cybersecurity improvements come from fixing the structural flaws and shifting to better approaches. Better approaches are drawn from proven and practical business management methods in simplification, psychology, systems thinking and design thinking. These can more easily achieve benefits through diverse, high-performing teams. 
Cybersecurity of consumer products against the background of the EU model of cyberspace protection. The entry into force of Regulation 2019/881 heralded a new stage in the construction of the EU cybersecurity model. At present, at the level of both EU institutions and individual Member States, preparatory work is underway to create the first ICT certification programmes relating to the area of cybersecurity. To date, the role of national competition and consumer protection authorities in helping to build a coherent cybersecurity model has not been sufficiently highlighted. The problem of the cybersecurity of products intended for the consumer market is a pressing issue. Furthermore, its significance is growing due in no small part to the increasing number of so-called smart connected consumer products and the mass expansion of the IoT market. As a result, threats to security or privacy increasingly stem not from cyberattacks on leading providers of online services but from the exploitation of vulnerabilities in commonly-used consumer products. This article aims to discuss the possible role of competition and consumer protection authorities in shaping a future model of EU cybersecurity. We discuss the existing mechanisms in EU law that allow supervisory authorities to shape the consumer product safety market and consider whether these measures can also be considered adequate for cybersecurity purposes. Particular attention is paid to identifying what legislative steps would be necessary to effectively synthesize the new EU cybersecurity regulations (including the planned cybersecurity certification framework) with existing consumer product safety laws. certification framework. consumer protection. cybersecurity. general product safety. misleading commercial practices. 
Breaking botnets: A quantitative analysis of individual, technical, isolationist, and multilateral approaches to cybersecurity. Malicious networks of botnets continue to grow in strength as millions of new users and devices connect to the internet each day, many becoming unsuspectingly complicit in cyber-attacks or unwitting accomplices to cybercrimes. Both states and nonstate actors use botnets to surreptitiously control the combined computing power of infected devices to engage in espionage, hacking, and to carry out distributed denial of service attacks to disable internet-connected targets from businesses and banks to power grids and electronic voting systems. Although cybersecurity professionals have established a variety of best practices to fight botnets, many important questions remain concerning why levels of botnet infections differ sharply from country to country, as relatively little empirical testing has been done to establish which policies and approaches to cybersecurity are actually the most effective. Using newly available time-series data on botnets, this article outlines and tests the conventionally held beliefs and cybersecurity strategies at every level'individual, technical, isolationist, and multilateral. This study finds that wealthier countries are more vulnerable than less wealthy countries. that technical solutions, including patching software, preventing spoofing, and securing servers, consistently outperform attempts to educate citizens about cybersecurity. and that countries which favor digital isolation and restrictions on internet freedom are not actually better protected than those who embrace digital freedom and multilateral approaches to cybersecurity. This latter finding is of particular importance as China's attempts to fundamentally reshape the internet via the Digital Silk Roadcomponent of the Belt and Road Initiative will actually end up making both China and the world less secure. Due to the interconnected nature of threats in cyberspace, states should instead embrace multilateral, technical solutions to better govern this global common and increase cybersecurity around the world. anti-spoofing protocol.

Cyberattacks, cyber threats, and attitudes toward cybersecurity policies. Does exposure to cyberattacks influence public support for intrusive cybersecurity policies? How do perceptions of cyber threats mediate this relationship? While past research has demonstrated how exposure to cyberattacks affects political attitudes, the mediating role played by threat perception has been overlooked. This study employs a controlled randomized survey experiment design to test the effect of exposure to lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks on support for different types of cybersecurity policies. One thousand twenty-two Israeli participants are exposed to scripted and simulated television reports of lethal or nonlethal cyberattacks against national infrastructure. Findings suggest that exposure to cyberattacks leads to greater support for stringent cybersecurity regulations, through a mechanism of threat perception. Results also indicate that different types of exposure relate to heightened support for different types of regulatory policies. People exposed to lethal cyberattacks tend to support cybersecurity policies that compel the government to alert citizens about cyberattacks. People who were exposed to nonlethal attacks, on the other hand, tend to support oversight policies at higher levels. More broadly, our research suggests that peoples' willingness to accept government cybersecurity policies that limit personal civil liberties and privacy depends on the type of cyberattacks to which they were exposed and the perceptions associated with such exposure. cyberattacks. cybersecurity. cybersecurity policies. threat perceptions.

Users Awareness Prediction of Cyber Security Aspects in Twitter Using Machine Learning Algorithms. Social media websites contain huge amount of Personal Identifiable Information for a tremendous number of users. Network security measures play a vital role in protecting such sensitive information. Unfortunately, such measures are plagued with vulnerabilities at all levels, which are destined to be exploited, especially, when users lack awareness of the many different aspects of cyber security. Security is as strong as its weakest link, and often, its weakest link is an oblivious user. Therefore, the user best interest to become aware of the various aspects of cyber security to keep their sensitive data out of attacker’s reach is in social media. These aspects include privacy, security, social engineering, and different types of network attacks. In this work, a dataset that consists of tweets related to these four aspects has been collected from Twitter website for analysis. The aim is to measure Twitter users' awareness of these aspects and to leverage machine learning in developing a set of recommendations for tuning privacy and network controls. Such recommendations can be utilized by existing and new users alike. To this end, a new model has been built by applying pre-processing techniques, then extracting the features from the dataset using two popular techniques, and finally feeding them into four popular machine learning models which are Multinominal Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. A two-level classification is used: general category and specific category. General category consists of five labels, i.e. privacy, security, social engineering, several network attacks, and other. In specific category, each one of the general category labels, except other, is further classified into sub-labels. The results achieved for major category classification have been as follows: the model with Logistic Regression algorithm has given the best results in four evaluation metrics compared with the others. Whereas, for specific category, the results have been as follows. Decision Tree has achieved the highest performance in privacy and security aspects. Support Vector Machine has given the best results in social engineering aspects. Both Logistic Regression and Multinominal Naïve Bayes have outperformed the other algorithms for network attacks aspect. Finally, some recommendations are presented, such as avoiding private information sharing on social media websites, use of strong passwords, use of different passwords for different social media accounts, and using secure http (https) instead of plain http to browse social media networking websites.

Critical Infrastructure and Cybersecurity in Chile: Guidelines for Consensus [Infraestructura Crítica y Ciberseguridad en Chile orientaciones para su consenso]. Adequately defining Critical Infrastructure is key to an adequate national cybersecurity strategy. however, the concept has dimensions that have not been considered in its design. Science, Technology and Society studies (STS) can contribute to a transversal and interdisciplinary vision for the development of this concept. This requires increasing the number of actors in its design and development and involving society as a whole, to democratize the implementation of a national cybersecurity strategy that properly defines its critical infrastructure. The research shows cybersecurity as a socio-technical object that needs to be explained in its technical and social dimensions. As a case study, the process of defining Critical Infrastructure in Chile is followed, sector definitions are compared and the impact on industries and society is shown. Finally, it refers to the relationship between critical infrastructure and critical information infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity Policy. Democracy. Risks. 
Automotive Cybersecurity Testing: Survey of Testbeds and Methods. Computing and connectivity capabilities in modern cars have introduced new cybersecurity challenges that can potentially affect the safety of an automobile and its occupants. Effective cybersecurity testing of vehicles can play a crucial role in discovering and addressing security flaws. however testing a real vehicle (involv-ing cyber-physical components) carries safety and economic risks. Therefore, many researchers and practitioners rely on testing environments (commonly known as testbeds) for uncovering cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient security testing needs the application of appropriate and systematic testing methods. This study presents a survey of seven different automotive cybersecurity testbeds proposed over the last ten years (between 2012 and 2019) as well as four different types of cybersecurity testing methods employed by cybersecurity researchers. This survey will help students, researchers, and professionals with designing and building their testbeds and refining their testing techniques and methodologies. Approaches. Automotive.

The Role of Competition Policy in Cybersecurity. In the last months, dozens of antitrust proceedings against top technology firms have been opened throughout the world, including Amazon, Apple and Google. It has been claimed in several jurisdictions, including the EU and the US, that current antitrust legislation needs to be amended in order to fit the current reality of ubiquitous technology. Competition law is thus frequently perceived as a tool of choice to address all the market problems in the on-line world. We argue in this Article that the role of competition law should not be stretched too far beyond its current boundaries, and that specific, non-antitrust regulation might often provide more appropriate means to remedy the market failures. We discuss this on recent examples from cybersecurity and data privacy. Abuse of Dominance. Anticompetitive Conduct of States. Competition law. Cybersecurity. Data Privacy. 
METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR ENSURING CYBERSECURITY OF INDUSTRIAL AND WEB-ORIENTED SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS [МЕТОДЫ И ТЕХНОЛОГИИ ОБЕСПЕЧЕНИЯ КИБЕРБЕЗОПАСНОСТИ ИНДУСТРИАЛЬНЫХ И ВЕБ-ОРИЕНТИРОВАННЫХ СИСТЕМ И СЕТЕЙ] [МЕТОДИ ТА ТЕХНОЛОГІЇ ЗАБЕЗПЕЧЕННЯ КІБЕРБЕЗПЕКИ ІНДУСТРІАЛЬНИХ І ВЕБ-ОРІЄНТОВАНИХ СИСТЕМ І МЕРЕЖ]. The subject matter of the article is methods and technologies of ensuring the cybersecurity of industrial and web-oriented systems and networks, training of cybersecurity specialists during the acquisition of professional knowledge. The purpose of the article is to ensure the cybersecurity of industrial and web-oriented systems and networks by developing and implementing appropriate methodologies (concepts, principles, set of models, methods) and technologies in the industry, as well as in training the cybersecurity specialists during the acqui-sition of professional knowledge. The problem of developing models, methods, and technologies for ensuring the cybersecurity of mobile systems, web-oriented systems based on content management systems, virtual net-works that provide their interaction, and a methodology for training cybersecurity specialists are formulat-ed. Based on the analysis the particular tasks of developing convolutional neural network model, information technology methods and models for ensuring the cybersecurity of web-oriented systems and networks, a meth-odological framework of creating information technology, and a model of digital knowledge platform for use in the field of cybersecurity specialists training and security of industrial systems were formulated.

Comparative Analysis of National Cyber Security Strategies using Topic Modelling. Comprehensive comparative analyses of national cyber security strategies (NCSSs) have thus far been limited or complicated by the unique nature of cybersecurity, which combines various areas such as technology, industry, economy, and defense in a complex manner. This study aims to characterize the NCSSs of major countries, quantitatively considering the time series, and identify further cybersecurity agendas for the benefit of NCSS revision in South Korea, by applying topic modelling to the analysis of eight NCSSs from the US, UK, Japan, and EU. As a result, fifteen agendas were identified and grouped into four sectors. We determined from the agenda distribution that the approach of each country to cybersecurity was different. In addition, additional agendas worthy of consideration for future NCSS revisions in South Korea were proposed, based on a comparison of the 15 aforementioned agendas with those of South Korea. This study is significant for cybersecurity policy in terms of enabling quantitative analysis in a single framework via latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling, and deriving further cybersecurity agendas for future NCSS revisions in South Korea.

Cybersecurity attacks on software logic and error handling within ADS-B implementations: Systematic testing of resilience and countermeasures. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a cornerstone of the next-generation digital sky and is now mandated in several countries. However, there have been many reports of serious security vulnerabilities in the ADS-B architecture. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the impact of multiple cyberattacks on ADS-B via remote radio frequency links that affected various network, processing, and display subsystems used within the ADS-B ecosystem. Overall we implemented and tested 12 cyberattacks on ADS-B in a controlled environment, out of which 5 attacks were presented or implemented for the first time. For all these attacks, we developed a unique testbed that consisted of 13 hardware devices and 22 software that ran on Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems, which result in a total of 36 tested configurations. Each of the attacks was successful on various subsets of the tested configurations. In some attacks, we discovered wide qualitative variations and discrepancies in how particular configurations react to and treat ADS-B inputs that contain errors or contradicting flight information, with the main culprit almost always being the software implementation. In some other attacks, we managed to cause Denial of Service (DoS) by remotely crashing/impacting more than 50% of the test-set that corresponded to those attacks. Besides demonstrating successful attacks, we also implemented, investigated, and report herein some practical countermeasures to these attacks. We demonstrated that the strong relationship between the received signal strength and the distance-to-emitter might help verify the aircrafts advertised ADS-B position and distance. For example, our best machine learning models achieved 90% accuracy in detecting spoofed ADS-B signals, which may be effectively used to distinguish ADS-B signals of real aircraft from spoofed signals of attackers.

The non-anthropocentric informational agents: Codes, software, and the logic of emergence in cybersecurity. Many theoretical approaches to cybersecurity adopt an anthropocentric conceptualisation of agency. that is, tying the capacity to act to human subjectivity and disregarding the role of the non-human in co-constructing its own (in)security. This article argues that such approaches are insufficient in capturing the complexities of cyber incidents, particularly those that involve self-perpetuating malware and autonomous cyber attacks that can produce unintentional and unpredictable consequences. Using interdisciplinary insights from the philosophy of information and software studies, the article counters the anthropocentrism in the cybersecurity literature by investigating the agency of syntactic information (that is, codes/software) in co-producing the logics and politics of cybersecurity. It specifically studies the complexities of codes/software as informational agents, their self-organising capacities, and their autonomous properties to develop an understanding of cybersecurity as emergent security. Emergence is introduced in the article as a non-linear security logic that captures the peculiar agential capacities of codes/software and the ways in which they challenge human control and intentionality by co-constructing enmity and by co-producing the subjects and objects of cybersecurity.

Model for successful development and implementation of Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC). Cyberattacks have changed dramatically and have become highly advanced. This latest phenomenon has a massive negative impact on organizations, such as financial losses and shutting-down of operations. Therefore, developing and implementing the Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC) is imperative and timely. Based on previous research, there are no international guidelines and standards used by organizations that can contribute to the successful implementation and development of SOC. In this regard, this study focuses on highlighting the significant factors that will impact and contribute to the success of SOC. Simultaneously, it will further design a model for the successful development and implementation of SOC for the organization. The study was conducted quantitatively and involved 63 respondents from 25 ministries and agencies in Malaysia. The results of this study will enable the retrieval of ten success factors for SOC, and it specifically focuses on humans, processes, and technology. The descriptive analysis shows that the top management support factor is the most influential factor in the success of the development and implementation of SOC. The study also contributes to the empirical finding that technology and process factors are more significant in the success of SOCs. Based on the regression test, the technology factor has major impact on determining the success of SOC, followed by the process and human factors. Relevant organizations or agencies can use the proposed model to develop and implement SOCs, formulate policies and guidelines, strengthen human models, and enhance cyber security.. 
Smart Cities, Playable Cities, and Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review. Smart cities connect humans to networks of information to create urban operating systems that optimize traffic management, sustainable energy use, and enact smart governance. The concept of playable cities has been advanced to create smart cities that are more human-centered. As smart cities are socio-technical structures involving technologies, people, and policies that each impact privacy and security, such an approach also has potential to develop stronger cybersecurity protocols for smart cities going beyond technological approaches. In this article, we conduct a systematic literature review of articles from 2015 to 2020 that discuss smart/playable cities and data gathering in relation to privacy and security. Based on this systematic review, we found a disconnect exists between smart and playable cities literature in terms of exclusive focus on technological solutions for security and little focus on people and policies as part of cybersecurity in the literature analyzed. Seeing as playable cities embrace user-generated co-creation, we argue that this personal side is important to get people to participate meaningfully in smart cities that lets them embrace cybersecurity policies as part of personal behavior. For this purpose, we propose utilizing a cybersecurity lens (e.g., McCumber cube model) so that smart city designers can more fully develop and consider cybersecurity that includes both personal privacy and playable approaches. 
Recognition of the Cybersecurity State of IoT devices. The identification of the cybersecurity (CS) state of Internet of things (IoT) devices determines the necessity to search for and improve approaches to detecting various threat types. The unification used in the mass development of IoT devices facilitates software and hardware modification to block certain built-in protective functions from the side of a potential intruder. A need arises to develop universal methods for identifying the cybersecurity state of devices using comprehensive approaches to analyzing data from internal and external information channels. The article presents an approach to identifying the cybersecurity of IoT devices based on processing time series recorded from sensors during various processes, and internal and external (third-party) sources. The approach is based on classification methods. The presented solution uses template sequences containing synchronized time series showing numerical values obtained from various probes and sensors during process execution. The proposed approach makes it possible to identify IoT device cybersecurity states without increasing the volume of information stored and processed in internal resources .

Cyber security in marine transport: Opportunities and legal challenges. In recent years, the number of cyber attacks, virus carriers, and cybercrime on maritime transport facilities has increased significantly. The emergence of new types of maritime vessels, such as autonomous vessels, dependent entirely on information and communication technologies used for passengers, cargo and baggage transportation, requires legal regulation of relations in this area. Therefore, ensuring cybersecurity in maritime transport and the need to adopt appropriate legal norms, standards and measures at both the international and national levels to manage maritime cyber risks are considered one of the most relevant topics for maritime transport. There is no single, systematic integrated approach, unification of requirements and rules in cybersecurity’s sphere of maritime transport [15]. In this regard, the authors analyze the issues of ensuring cybersecurity in maritime transport, the legal basis of security: some international documents and national legal acts, regulating cybersecurity in maritime transport, will be considered, as well as the main question of how they are able to meet modern requirements for ensuring cybersecurity in maritime transport.

Cybersecurity in Big Data Era: From Securing Big Data to Data-Driven Security. Knowledge is power' is an old adage that has been found to be true in today's information age. Knowledge is derived from having access to information. The ability to gather information from large volumes of data has become an issue of relative importance. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is the term coined by researchers to describe the art of processing, storing and gathering large amounts of data for future examination. Data is being produced at an alarming rate. The rapid growth of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) and other technological advances are the main culprits behind this sustained growth. The data generated is a reflection of the environment it is produced out of, thus we can use the data we get out of systems to figure out the inner workings of that system. This has become an important feature in cybersecurity where the goal is to protect assets. Furthermore, the growing value of data has made big data a high value target. In this paper, we explore recent research works in cybersecurity in relation to big data. We highlight how big data is protected and how big data can also be used as a tool for cybersecurity. We summarize recent works in the form of tables and have presented trends, open research challenges and problems. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of cybersecurity in the big data era, as well as research trends and open challenges in this active research area. big data driven security.

Matching Cyber Security Ontologies through Genetic Algorithm-Based Ontology Alignment Technique. Security ontology can be used to build a shared knowledge model for an application domain to overcome the data heterogeneity issue, but it suffers from its own heterogeneity issue. Finding identical entities in two ontologies, i.e., ontology alignment, is a solution. It is important to select an effective similarity measure (SM) to distinguish heterogeneous entities. However, due to the complex semantic relationships among concepts, no SM is ensured to be effective in all alignment tasks. The aggregation of SMs so that their advantages and disadvantages complement each other directly affects the quality of alignments. In this work, we formally define this problem, discuss its challenges, and present a problem-specific genetic algorithm (GA) to effectively address it. We experimentally test our approach on bibliographic tracks provided by OAEI and five pairs of security ontologies. The results show that GA can effectively address different heterogeneous ontology-alignment tasks and determine high-quality security ontology alignments. 
The Infodemic as a Threat to Cybersecurity. The infodemic has become a means to facilitate the exploitation of weaknesses in digital networks and launch cyberattacks against vulnerable communities and vital services, highlighting a lack of cybersecurity in critical infrastructure. This paper will delve into the caveats of the cyber threats posed by the infodemic and what it means for the broader network of cybersecurity and the protection of human rights in cyberspace. It will also examine the damage sustained by vulnerable groups as a result of cyberattacks, particularly in light of COVID-19. The infodemic has created a situation where malicious cyber actors spread false information to manipulate human nature and deceive individuals, leaving them susceptible to devastating attacks that risk producing physical and financial harm. This has the effect of undermining human security, dignity and equity in cyberspace. The situation is further exacerbated by the lack of accountability that operates as a carte blanche for cybercriminals to continue with illicit operations against vulnerable persons.

Factors Influencing the Adoption of Cyber Security Standards Among Public Listed Companies in Malaysia. Employee's failure to adhere to their organization's cyber security policies contributes most of the cyber incidents. To secure information security systems, companies need to communicate behavioral and technical solutions to their employees, due to the fragility of the human factor since it plays a critically significant role in securing cyber systems. The necessity to safeguard information systems have speed up the evolution of the present method of cyber security, which should be based on adequately adopting cyber security standards to secure business enterprise's assets and users in cyberspace. This paper studies factors influencing the adoption of cyber security standards among public listed companies in Malaysia. Through online survey that was distributed among 275 Public listed companies. The findings indicated that expected related benefits and perceived ease of use had significant impact on the adoption of cyber security standards. On the other hand, perceived security had played important moderating influence on the relationship between organizational factors and the adoption of cyber security standards.

Statistical Analysis of Cybersecurity Awareness Issues in Higher Education Institutes. Now-a-days, computers and the Internet are becoming increasingly indispensable tools in several aspects of our lives, including academic study, professional work, entertainment, and communication. Despite the significant advantages of information technology, particularly in information accessibility and internet applications, cyber security has risen to become a national concern in Saudi Arabia, and cyber security threats now need to be taken more seriously. Therefore, computer and network security are a concern not only for traditional security awareness organisations, for example, military, bank, or financial institutions, but also for every individual and government official who use computers. Besides, nowadays, more and more organisations' valuable assets are stored in the computerised information system. security has become an essential and urgent issue. However, it is remarkable that most systems today are designed with little attention to security concerns. This study aims to examine and analyse cyber security issues, including cyber risk, cyber security, cyber security awareness, and cyber trust, among higher education students in Saudi Arabia. Based on an analysis of the collected data using SPSS, the findings of this study highlight a lack of awareness of basic information related to cyber security among Saudi students. In addition, the number of students attending training programs was very low. Considering other security issues, this study reveals that while Saudi students are aware of cyber risk, they are not aware of cyber security. In addition, Saudi students are not aware of and do not have cyber trust. cyber risk. Cyber security. cyber security awareness. cyber trust. educational institutes. higher education. 
Manipulating uncertainty: Cybersecurity politics in Egypt. Cybersecurity, defined as the prevention and mitigation of malicious interference with digital devices and networks, is a key area of contest for digitalized politics, especially in uncertain and turbulent situations. Nowhere is this more starkly illustrated than in states such as Egypt, where the period since the January 2011 revolution has seen several changes of government and the subsequent consolidation of executive power, increasingly strict limits on free speech, and extensive violence by Islamist groups against the state and civilian targets and by the state against protesters and dissidents. How, then, are cybersecurity policies, practices, and technologies deployed and contested in uncertain political environments? The article argues that cybersecurity provides a way for the Egyptian government and opposition activists to manipulate uncertaintyto their advantage. Each side uses cybersecurity policies, practices, and technologies to restrict their adversary's scope for action, seeking to make the other more predictable while retaining or increasing their own freedom of action. In addition to providing extensive empirical data on cybersecurity developments in Egypt, the article makes two theoretical contributions. First, it shows how political struggles between state and opposition movements assimilate the influential language and content of cybersecurity, generating distinct cybersecurity politics. Second, it highlights the role of uncertainty as a driver - among others - of cycles of innovation and response in contentious politics, including those that center on cybersecurity. censorship. contentious politics. cybersecurity.

The application of cyber security capability maturity model to identify the impact of internal efficiency factors on the external effectiveness of cyber security. Cyber security threats to the digital infrastructure have been increasing manifold and are concerns for the resilience of the business. There is constant need to improve and measure the cyber security performance. Although there are various capability maturity models formulated, there is a need to construct the internal efficiency and external effectiveness factors of cyber security, which can be further correlated to improve the effectiveness of the performance. In this paper, we constructed the efficiency and effectiveness factors of cyber security by using grounded theory methodologies and developed models to identify the impact of internal efficiency factors on the external effectiveness of cyber security using SEM techniques. Research data is collected from 216 respondents comprising of information security and business stakeholders from seven business sectors. This study has implications for future researchers and practitioner for improving cyber security performance. Copyright . Cyber security. Cyber security effectiveness. Cyber security efficiency.

Private active cyber defense and (international) cyber security - Pushing the line?. Private sector Active Cyber Defence (ACD) lies on the intersection of domestic security and international security and is a recurring subject, often under the more provocative flag of 'hack back', in the American debate about cyber security. This article looks at the theory and practice of private cyber security provision and analyses in more detail a number of recent reports and publications on ACD by Washington DC based commissions and think tanks. Many of these propose legalizing forms of active cyber defence, in which private cyber security companies would be allowed to operate beyond their own, or their clients' networks, and push beyond American law as it currently stands. Generally, public-private governance solutions for security problems have to manage a balance between (i) questions of capacity and assigning responsibilities, (ii) the political legitimacy of public-private security solutions and (iii) the mitigation of their external effects. The case of private active cyber defence reveals a strong emphasis on addressing the domestic security (and political) problem, while failing to convincingly address the international security problems. The proposals aim to create a legitimate market for active cyber defence, anchored to the state through regulation and certification as a way to balance capacity, responsibilities and domestic political legitimacy. A major problem is that even though these reports anticipate international repercussions and political pushback, against what is likely be received internationally as an escalatory and provocative policy, they offer little to mitigate it. active cyber defence. capacity. cybersecurity. public-private governance. sovereignty. 
Taxonomy of Cybersecurity Awareness Delivery Methods: A Countermeasure for Phishing Threats. Phishing is a serious threat to the Internet users and has become a vehicle for cybercriminals to perpetrate large-scale crimes worldwide. A wide range of technical and educational measures have been developed and used to address phishing threats. However, the technical anti-phishing measures have been widely studied in the current literature whereas comprehensive analysis of the non-technical anti-phishing techniques has generally been ignored. To close this gap, we develop a new taxonomy of the most common cybersecurity training delivery methods and compare them along various factors. The work reported in this paper is useful for various stakeholders. For organizations conducting or considering phishing training, it helps them understand the various awareness training and phishing campaigns capabilities and design an appropriate program with a meaningful return. For researchers, it offers a clearer understanding of the main challenges, the existing solution space, and the potential scope of future research to be addressed. anti-phishing awareness delivery methods. cybersecurity awareness. cybersecurity threats. human factors in cybersecurity.

Information Systems Sourcing Strategies and Organizational Cybersecurity Breaches. This article compares the impacts of various information systems (IS) sourcing strategies on organizational cybersecurity breaches. Through a longitudinal empirical analysis, we found that when the organization has a narrower spread of IT applications, a best of breed (BoB) strategy is less likely to cause cybersecurity breaches than a single-sourcing approach. and the difference is decreasing as its IT application spread increases. The insourcing strategy has shown a lower likelihood of organizational cybersecurity breaches than any outsourcing strategy &#x005B. i.e., single-sourcing, best of suite (BoS), and BoB&#x005D. , which is weakened by the organization&#x0027. s IT application spread and is significant only when the IT application spread is relatively low. A BoS strategy has an insignificant difference in cybersecurity breaches compared to the BoB approach. However, for organizations with a broader spread of IT applications, there is no significant difference among all sourcing strategies on the likelihood of cybersecurity breaches. This research provides theoretical and practical implications for organizational cybersecurity management in IS development and interorganizational relationships. IEEE. Best of breed. best of suite.

Dimensions of cybersecurity performance and crisis response in critical infrastructure organisations: an intellectual capital perspective. Purpose: This research addresses the relationships between the current, dynamic organisational cyber risk climate, organisational cybersecurity performance and changes in cybersecurity investments, with an aim to address the hostile epistemic climate for intellectual capital management presented by the dynamics of cybersecurity as a phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach: Expanding on the views of digital security and resilience as a knowledge problem, the research looks at cybersecurity as a critical capability within organisations, particularly relevant in critical infrastructure sectors. The problem is studied from the perspective of 400 C-level executives from critical infrastructure sectors across the UK. Data collected at the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a time when critical infrastructure organisations have been under a significant strain due to an increase in cybersecurity incidents, were analysed using partial least square structural equation modelling. Findings: The research found a significant correlation between the board's perception of a change in their cybersecurity risk climate and patterns of both the development of cybersecurity management capabilities and cybersecurity investments. The authors also found that a positive correlation exists between the efforts placed by critical infrastructure organisations in cybersecurity training and the changes in investment in their cybersecurity, particularly in relation to their intellectual capital development efforts. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper that explores the board's perception of cybersecurity in critical infrastructure organisations both from the intellectual capital perspective and in the dynamic cyber risk climate derived from the COVID-19 crisis. The authors’ findings expand on the growing perception of cybersecurity as a knowledge problem, and thus inform future research and practice in the domain of intellectual capital management and its role in supporting the cybersecurity and digital resilience of business and society.

Dynamic defenses in cyber security: Techniques, methods and challenges. Driven by the rapid development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing and other emerging technologies, the connotation of cyberspace is constantly expanding and becoming the fifth dimension of human activities. However, security problems in cyberspace are becoming serious, and traditional defense measures (e.g., firewall, intrusion detection systems and security audit) often fall into a passive situation of being prone to attacks and difficult to take effect when responding to new types of network attacks with a higher and higher degree of coordination and intelligence. By constructing and implementing the diverse strategy of dynamic transformation, the configuration characteristics of systems are constantly changing, and the probability of vulnerability exposure is increasing. Therefore, the difficulty and cost of attack are increasing, which provides new ideas for reversing the asymmetric situation of defense and attack in cyberspace. Nonetheless, few related works systematically introduce dynamic defense mechanisms for cyber security. The related concepts and development strategies of dynamic defense are rarely analyzed and summarized. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and concrete survey of recent research efforts on dynamic defense in cyber security. Specifically, we firstly introduce basic concepts and define dynamic defense in cyber security. Next, we review the architectures, enabling techniques and methods for moving target defense and mimic defense. This is followed by taxonomically summarizing the implementation and evaluation of dynamic defense. Finally, we discuss some open challenges and opportunities on dynamic defense in cyber security.

Cardiac implantable electronic devices and cybersecurity. Introduction: Many cardiac devices, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and pacemakers (PPM), often involve a remote connection to allow for data transfer and accessibility from the device to the medical clinic. These devices are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and data breach. Areas covered: The FDA, device manufacturers and professional cardiology societies work in conjunction to assess and evaluate potential areas of weakness in medical devices and formulate software update improvements to strengthen patient safety. We undertook a literature review focusing on the history, progression, and improvements in monitoring of cybersecurity vulnerabilities surrounding cardiovascular medical devices. Expert opinion: Cardiac device cybersecurity will continue to evolve and progress as more research is conducted on potential areas of vulnerabilities. The standard procedure as of now is for multiple perspectives from the FDA, professional organizations, device manufacturers, physicians, and patients to review and analyze the effectiveness of cybersecurity safeguards for these devices. We believe this practice will continue as it equally involves all stakeholders in relation to the manufacturing, distribution, and use of these devices. As information technology capabilities expand, safer and secure medical devices and cardiac technology to prevent the threat of hacking will continue to expand and improve.

Risk Assessment Methods for Cybersecurity in Nuclear Facilities: Compliance to Regulatory Requirements. As strategic infrastructures, nuclear facilities are considered attractive targets for attackers to commit their malicious intention. At the same time, for efficiency, those infrastructures are increasingly implemented, equipped with, and managed by digitally computerized systems. Attackers, therefore, try to realign their attack scenarios through such cyber systems. It is crucial to understand various existing risk assessment methods for cybersecurity in nuclear facilities to prevent such attacks. Risk assessment is designed to study the nature of the originated attack threats and the consequences implied. This paper studies a series of risk assessment methods implemented for security related to cybersecurity of strategic infrastructures, including nuclear facilities. Extended from cybersecurity, the required concepts in nuclear security cover defense-in-depth, synergy of safety and security, and probabilistic safety/risk assessment. Selecting cybersecurity risk assessment methods should integrate these three essential concepts in their evaluation. This paper highlights the suitable and appropriate risk assessment methods that meet security requirements in the nuclear industry as specified in the national and international regulations. cybersecurity. nuclear facilities. regulatory requirements.

Cybersecurity awareness: A critical analysis of education and law enforcement methods. According to the international Anti-Phishing Work Group (APWG), phishing activities have abruptly risen over the last few years, and users are becoming more susceptible to online and mobile fraud. Machine Learning techniques have potential for building technical anti-phishing models, with a handful already implemented in the real time environment. However, majority of them have yet to be applied in a real time environment and require domain experts to interpret the results. This gives conventional techniques a vital role as supportive tools for a wider audience, especially novice users. This paper reviews in-depth, common, phishing countermeasures including legislation, law enforcement, hands-on training, and education among others. A complete prevention layer based on the aforementioned approaches is suggested to increase awareness and report phishing to different stakeholders, including organizations, novice users, researchers, and computer security experts. Therefore, these stakeholders can understand the upsides and downsides of the current conventional approaches and the ways forward for improving them. Anti-phishing. Cyber security.

Low complexity cybersecurity architecture for the development of ITS in smart cities. The application of an intelligent transportation system (ITS) within smart cities is an emerging technology that requires access to a network, and might be exposed to cyberattacks, which may affect the privacy of users and drivers. One of the most important pieces of private information is the vehicle location, which may lead to physical attacks. Therefore, a security technique should be applied to secure the vehicle’s user data and location. Adding hardware security to the tracking device will increase the hardware complexity to internet of things (IoT) sensor, which has a limited area. This paper proposed a low complexity cybersecurity architecture to protect user privacy and sensitive information. The implemented design has been synthesised and simulated, and results has been discussed and verified for selecting the best techniques of data protection and less design complexity. The hardware implementation can be reconfigured for different cipher keys and different size of cipher text. Cybersecurity. Industrial internet of things. Intelligent transportation system.

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Security. The scale of Internet-connected systems has increased considerably, and these systems are being exposed to cyberattacks more than ever. The complexity and dynamics of cyberattacks require protecting mechanisms to be responsive, adaptive, and scalable. Machine learning, or more specifically deep reinforcement learning (DRL), methods have been proposed widely to address these issues. By incorporating deep learning into traditional RL, DRL is highly capable of solving complex, dynamic, and especially high-dimensional cyber defense problems. This article presents a survey of DRL approaches developed for cyber security. We touch on different vital aspects, including DRL-based security methods for cyber-physical systems, autonomous intrusion detection techniques, and multiagent DRL-based game theory simulations for defense strategies against cyberattacks. Extensive discussions and future research directions on DRL-based cyber security are also given. We expect that this comprehensive review provides the foundations for and facilitates future studies on exploring the potential of emerging DRL to cope with increasingly complex cyber security problems.

A Cyber Security Evaluation Framework for In-Vehicle Electrical Control Units. Modern vehicles are equipped with more than 100 Electrical Control Units (ECUs) with over 2500 signals to transmit internally. The application of advanced electronics and communication techniques helps a vehicle transform from an information island into a powerful distribution center. However, a large number of ECUs have introduced a wider range of security threats for vehicles. The attackers can compromise a vehicle remotely through a vulnerable ECU. How to evaluate the cyber security of in-vehicle ECUs has become an important issue. Current Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) only carries out theoretical analysis on the potential threats and risks faced by the vehicle in the conceptual design phase of the lifecycle, but lacks the details of actual security evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a Cyber Security Evaluation Framework (CSEF) to independently evaluate the security of the in-vehicle ECUs, which is composed of the asset identification, the threat analysis, the risk assessment, and the security test. The proposed CSEF is applied to a pre-installed On-Bord Unit (OBU) to provide a use case. The use case show that the proposed CSEF is able to figure out assets, threats, risks behind threats, and vulnerabilities of OBU, playing an important role in guiding others to conduct security evaluation. Moreover, CSEF can be extended to evaluate the cyber security of other critical ECUs, such as the Telematic Box, the infotainment units, and the gateway. cyber security evaluation framework.

Protecting the Texas electric grid: A cybersecurity strategy for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT). The electrical system serves as the fundamental base of a country's economic activity, and is a likely target for cyberattacks. As the modern economy continues its evolution towards greater digitization and interconnectedness, policymakers must outline and enforce regulations protecting those critical assets, without which the economy would suffer. The Texas Interconnection, due to being independently operated, and to a large-extent legislated by the state of Texas, enjoys a simpler regulatory environment than its counterparts in the rest of the contiguous 48 states. We exploit this relative independence to offer policy solutions to better protect Texas against a cyberattack on its electric grid. Specifically, ERCOT and the PUCT have the authority and ability to streamline and simplify the potentially confusing protocols enforced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to make adoption more likely. We also discuss grant programs for smaller utilities and the role of cyber-insurance in helping utilities navigate the difficulties in understanding the protocols so that compliance can occur. cybersecurity. electric grid.

Cyber-Security Assessment of Industry 4.0 Enabled Mechatronic System. This paper reports on development of a laboratory set-up, for testing the concept and the components of Industry 4.0 enabled mechatronic system. A simple mock manufacturing lane is connected to a collaborating robot. There are three different programmable logic controllers (PLC) and various other elements which need to talk to each other using a variety of communication protocols. The controllers, and consequently the schedule of operations, can be programmed remotely. Moreover, the information is exchanged through the cloud service which could also assume the role of a soft-PLC. From the perspective of cyber-security, this set-up enables defining benchmarks and performing tests for resilience of the control structure. Some test scenarios are discussed in the paper. 
A rough cut cybersecurity investment using portfolio of security controls with maximum cybersecurity value. This paper deals with optimisation of cybersecurity investment in supply chains using stochastic programming approach. A classical exponential function of breach probability and the intuitive idea of ‘the expected net benefits’, originally presented in 2002 by Gordon and Loeb, were applied to introduce the concept of cybersecurity value. The cybersecurity value of security control is defined as the value gained by implementing a single control to secure a subset of components. The cybersecurity value of a control can be seen as a measure of its efficiency in reducing vulnerability of a secured system or component. A mixed binary optimisation problem, next transformed into an unconstrained binary program is developed to maximise total cybersecurity value of control portfolio. The optimal solution to the binary program provides a simple formula to immediately obtain the portfolio of security controls with maximum total cybersecurity value and determine a rough cut cybersecurity investment. This study also shows that portfolio of security controls with maximum total cybersecurity value reduces the losses from security breaches and mitigate the impact of cyber risk. cybersecurity investment.

Adversarial XAI Methods in Cybersecurity. Machine Learning methods are playing a vital role in combating ever-evolving threats in the cybersecurity domain. Explanation methods that shed light on the decision process of black-box classifiers are one of the biggest drivers in the successful adoption of these models. Explaining predictions that address 'Why?/Why Not?' questions help users/stakeholders/analysts understand and accept the predicted outputs with confidence and build trust. Counterfactual explanations are gaining popularity as an alternative method to help users to not only understand the decisions of black-box models (why?) but also to provide a mechanism to highlight mutually exclusive data instances that would change the outcomes (why not?). Recent Explainable Artificial Intelligence literature has focused on three main areas: (a) creating and improving explainability methods that help users better understand how the internal of ML models work as well as their outputs. (b) attacks on interpreters with a white-box setting. (c) defining the relevant properties, metrics of explanations generated by models. Nevertheless, there is no thorough study of how the model explanations can introduce new attack surfaces to the underlying systems. A motivated adversary can leverage the information provided by explanations to launch membership inference, and model extraction attacks to compromise the overall privacy of the system. Similarly, explanations can also facilitate powerful evasion attacks such as poisoning and back door attacks. In this paper, we cover this gap by tackling various cybersecurity properties and threat models related to counterfactual explanations. We propose a new black-box attack that leverages Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to compromise the confidentiality and privacy properties of underlying classifiers. We validate our approach with datasets and models used in the cyber security domain to demonstrate that our method achieves the attacker's goal under threat models which reflect the real-world settings. adversarial attacks. counterfactual explanations. cybersecurity. membership inference attacks. model stealing. poisoning attacks.

Studying Cybersecurity in Civil Aviation, Including Developing and Applying Aviation Cybersecurity Risk Assessment. In addition to the importance of safety in civil aviation, the significance of cybersecurity in the aviation sector cannot be ignored, and this fact has often been highlighted owing to frequent cyber-attacks that denigrate victim(s) and also lead to political and economic controversies. Cybersecurity has recently received a major boost, with the shift of air navigation facilities from analog ground-based systems to digital space-based systems to accommodate the tremendous growth in air traffic density. Furthermore, most air navigation facilities have open designs that tend to overlook security concerns. In this regard, identifying a systematic methodology for aviation cybersecurity risk assessment is a key element in the identification of potential threats, and assessment of their likelihood and risk levels, whereby risks can be reduced to tolerable levels through appropriate mitigation measures. Existing review articles have not addressed cybersecurity in all the various aviation systems, and have not considered a systematic methodology for aviation cybersecurity risk assessment. This paper therefore presents a systematic qualitative and quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment methodology for legacy and next-generation critical infrastructure in aviation systems, such as air-ground communication, radio navigation aids, aeronautical surveillance, and system-wide information management (SWIM). Our analysis shows that the communication, navigation, and surveillance systems with the highest risk levels are very-high frequency voice communication, satellite-based navigation, and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast, respectively, while those with the lowest risk levels are controller-pilot data link communication, ground-based radio navigation aids, and secondary surveillance radar, respectively. Furthermore, the risk level of potential cyber-attacks in SWIM is medium. Author. Aeronautical communication systems. aeronautical surveillance systems. air navigation systems. Aircraft navigation.

Social media users and cybersecurity awareness: predicting self-disclosure using a hybrid artificial intelligence approach. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the cybersecurity awareness manifested as protective behavior to explain self-disclosure in social networking sites. The disclosure of information about oneself is associated with benefits as well as privacy risks. The individuals self-disclose to gain social capital and display protective behaviors to evade privacy risks by careful cost-benefit calculation of disclosing information. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the role of cyber protection behavior in predicting self-disclosure along with demographics (age and gender) and digital divide (frequency of Internet access) variables by conducting a face-to-face survey. Data were collected from 284 participants. The model is validated by using multiple hierarchal regression along with the artificial intelligence approach. Findings: The results revealed that cyber protection behavior significantly explains the variance in self-disclosure behavior. The complementary use of five machine learning (ML) algorithms further validated the model. The ML algorithms predicted self-disclosure with an area under the curve of 0.74 and an F1 measure of 0.70. Practical implications: The findings suggest that costs associated with self-disclosure can be mitigated by educating the individuals to heighten their cybersecurity awareness through cybersecurity training programs. Originality/value: This study uses a hybrid approach to assess the influence of cyber protection behavior on self-disclosure using expectant valence theory (EVT). Artificial intelligence.

Cyber security awareness and behavior of youth in smartphone usage: A comparative study between university students in hungary and Vietnam. Within the digital culture, the increasing internet consumption and the constant development of technology, especially smartphones have made cyber awareness turn to be increasingly urgent. This study focuses on comparing the level of cyber security awareness, knowledge and behavior among university students in general and between Hungary and Vietnam in particular. Research data was collected, using a set of questionnaires and the 313 responses from University Students, in different school years and fields of study, in Hungary and Vietnam. Quantitative analysis was conducted using SPSS. Results show that all respondents possess a lack of knowledge of cyber security, leading to a low level of cyber threat awareness, beyond the differences in respondent countries. However, there are minor differences in the behavior, between respondents in Hungary and Vietnam, which were measured through four dimensions of cyber security: malware items, password usage issues, social engineering and online scam issues. This research helps to raise awareness of differences in cyber security mindfulness, due to cultural characteristics, that can be considered, when developing global mega-systems, such as, social platforms.

Adversarial Online Learning with Variable Plays in the Pursuit-Evasion Game: Theoretical Foundations and Application in Connected and Automated Vehicle Cybersecurity. We extend the adversarial/non-stochastic multi-play multi-armed bandit (MPMAB) to the case where the number of arms to play is variable. The work is motivated by the fact that the resources allocated to scan different critical locations in an interconnected transportation system change dynamically over time and depending on the environment. By modeling the malicious hacker and the intrusion monitoring system as the attacker and the defender, respectively, we formulate the problem for the two players as a sequential pursuit-evasion game. We derive the condition under which a Nash equilibrium of the strategic game exists. For the defender side, we provide an exponential-weighted based algorithm with sublinear pseudo-regret. We further extend our model to heterogeneous rewards for both players, and obtain lower and upper bounds on the average reward for the attacker. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of a variable-arm play.

Federated Deep Learning for Cyber Security in the Internet of Things: Concepts, Applications, and Experimental Analysis. In this article, we present a comprehensive study with an experimental analysis of federated deep learning approaches for cyber security in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specifically, we first provide a review of the federated learning-based security and privacy systems for several types of IoT applications, including, Industrial IoT, Edge Computing, Internet of Drones, Internet of Healthcare Things, Internet of Vehicles, etc. Second, the use of federated learning with blockchain and malware/intrusion detection systems for IoT applications is discussed. Then, we review the vulnerabilities in federated learning-based security and privacy systems. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis of federated deep learning with three deep learning approaches, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). For each deep learning model, we study the performance of centralized and federated learning under three new real IoT traffic datasets, namely, the Bot-IoT dataset, the MQTTset dataset, and the TON_IoT dataset. The goal of this article is to provide important information on federated deep learning approaches with emerging technologies for cyber security. In addition, it demonstrates that federated deep learning approaches outperform the classic/centralized versions of machine learning (non-federated learning) in assuring the privacy of IoT device data and provide the higher accuracy in detecting attacks. blockchain. cyber security. deep learning.

A retrospective analysis of maritime cyber security incidents. The maritime industry is undergoing a rapid evolution through the introduction of new technology and the digitization of existing services. At the same time, the digital attack surface is increasing, and incidents can lead to severe consequences. This study analyses and gives an overview of 46 maritime cyber security incidents from the last decade (2010-2020). We have collected information from open publications and reports, as well as anonymized data from insurance claims. Each incident is linked to a taxonomy of attack points related to onboard or off-ship systems, and the characteristics have been used to create a Top-10 list of maritime cyber threats. The results show that the maritime sector typically has incidents with low frequency and high impact, which makes them hard to predict and prepare for. We also infer that different types of attackers use a variety of attack points and techniques, hence there is no single solution to this problem. 
Cybersecurity policy and the Trump administration. This article evaluates the conditions under which national cybersecurity policy changes or remains stable. Consistent with theories of policy and bureaucratic inertia, particularly punctuated equilibrium theory (PET), it finds that national-level cybersecurity policy during the Trump administration was constrained by existing conceptual, political, and strategic commitments. It uses government and media documentation to observe two pivotal policy periods during the Trump administration. It finds that despite shifting from a nominally defensive to a nominally offensive posture, rather than revise policy categories and priorities, policy makers interpreted cyber threats within existing threat and policy categories. These findings offer two contributions to policy scholarship. First, they begin the process of situating the Trump administration in the larger context of US cybersecurity policy. Second, they demonstrate constraints on senior policy makers as well as the utility of a punctuated equilibrium model. The Trump administration’s defending forward concept represented one of the most ambitious efforts to break with existing US cybersecurity policy. however, even this effort was constrained in ways consistent with punctuated equilibrium theory. cyber attack. cybersecurity. defending forward. executive order. inertia. national security. plausibility probe. punctuated equilibrium theory.

Learning without Forgetting: A New Framework for Network Cyber Security Threat Detection. Progressive learning addresses the problem of incrementally learning new tasks without compromising the prediction accuracy of previously learned tasks. In the context of artificial neural networks, several algorithms exist for achieving the progressive learning goal of learning without forgetting. However, these algorithms have traditionally been tested on the well-known and widely available datasets from the domain of image understanding and computer vision. Very little has been done on exploring the suitability of progressive learning algorithms in the important area of network threat detection. On a more fundamental level, progressive learning algorithms are still faced with the challenge of predicting the ultimate ability of a given neural network architecture to add more tasks to its repertoire without undergoing catastrophic forgetting. The goal of this paper is to address such a challenge in the context of cyber security threat detection. It does so by providing a unified conceptual and computational framework where progressive learning algorithms can be analyzed, compared, and contrasted in terms of their learning capacity and prediction accuracy for specific datasets from the cloud cyber security domain. In particular, this paper provides rigorous metrics for predicting the onset of catastrophic forgetting in the cyber security domain and contrasts them with their usage in the imaging domain. Our extensive numerical results show that progressive learning, along with the proposed criteria for catastrophic forgetting, provides a very structured framework for automating network threat detection as new threats emerge throughout network operation. cyber security. elastic weight consolidation. fisher information.

Sustainable finance in cybersecurity investment for future profitability under uncertainty. This paper examines the sustainable financing of R&D activities in the cybersecurity industry as a long-term investment to generate future profits and protect societies from the consequences of uncertainty as an essential part of a nation’s security strategy. Since this study utilises a dynamic panel model, the hierarchy of financing sources for R&D activities is determined by controlling for specific fixed effects. The estimator's efficiency is improved by adopting the system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM), which relies on the current interaction of explanatory variables to achieve a future factor of returns using STATA. The study sample extracted from the Orbis database consists of 51 cybersecurity leaders in the US and the UK from 2016 to 2020. The findings indicate that cybersecurity leaders use external funds to finance R&D activities to achieve high future returns. Although uncertainty increases significantly in the short run, all other else being equal, average future returns are high.

Teaching cyber security course in the classrooms of nmims university. The paper aims at implementing new pedagogy and assessment practices from rigorous literature survey perusing quality papers and articles. The appropriate pedagogy and relevant assessment always go hand in hand. One cannot achieve effective teaching by compromising the other component. In engineering, pedagogy and assessment play extremely important roles. In recent years, engineering education has lost track of the big picture of what the curriculum has to be. In Computer Science Engineering, the course contents often change according to the demands for new technology in the market. Adhering to this fact, the courses must be designed either practical-based or case study based. Rote teaching-learning methods are not as effective as far as the curriculum design in the computing field is concerned. Cyber Security is one such course where students are expected to learn how to create a protective environment for computing and computing resources. The course must be designed in such a way that, students must learn how to identify the vulnerabilities in computing resources and methodologies to mitigate them. This course aims such that students must learn some popular attacks which help them to identify what are the possible ways from where the attacks could happen. The paper makes use of strategic assessment tools for the Cyber Security course (Taught to post-graduation students) and discusses outcomes through course outcome attainment analysis as per the threshold value of attainment set by the Computer Engineering Department to adhere to the accreditation standards. Through course attainment analysis it is observed that, Viva voce assessment tool is not suitable for evaluation of the course as it does not impose the technical details and working of Cyber Security concepts. The overall attainment was 55.55% which is 15% less than the threshold set by Computer Engineering Department. Course Outcomes. Cyber Security. Pedagogy.

The predictors of cybersecurity behavior in e-hailing services: The mediating role of perceived threat. E-hailing services have been on the rise since the advent of smartphones in 2009. It started with Uber services, which led to other e-hailing services in Malaysia, like Grabcar, Mycar and others. Despite the mounting popularity of e-hailing, its services are not without complaints or tragic occurrences. There have been cases reported of harassment, rape and even murder of passengers. Hence, the purpose of this study examines the predictors of e-hailing services with special attention to the mediating role of perceived threat. The study employed the quantitative research approach, where a questionnaire consisting of a total of 46 items was developed. A total of 400 responses were collected from the distribution of 400 questionnaires, representing a response rate of 58.75 per cent. The data was analysed using Structural-Equation Modelling (SEM) through the SmartPLS software. The finding shows that perceived threat is a significant direct predictor of cybersecurity behavior, while perceived vulnerability, perceived benefit and self-efficacy are direct predictors of the perceived threat and indirect significant predictors of cybersecurity, mediated by a perceived threat. Government policy has no significant direct or indirect impact on cybersecurity behavior. The findings imply that while e-hailing services have their benefits, customers need to be alert and vigilant at all times due to the vulnerability and threats that may come with their usage.

Cybersecurity verification and validation testing in automotive. The new generations of cars have a number of ECUs (Electronic Control Units) which are connected to a central gateway and need to pass cybersecurity integration tests to fulfil the homologation requirements of cars. Cars usually have a gateway server (few have additional domain servers) with Linux and a large number of ECUs which are real time control of actuators (ESP, EPS, ABS, etc. – usually they are multicore embedded controllers) connected by a real time automotive specific bus (CAN-FD) to the domain controller or gateway server. The norms (SAE J3061, ISO 21434) require cybersecurity related verification and validation. Fir the verification car manufacturers use a network test suite which runs > 2000 test cases and which have to be passed for homologation. These norms have impact on the way how car communication infrastructure is tested, and which cybersecurity attack patterns are checked before a road release of an ECU/car. This paper describes typical verification and validation approaches in modern vehicles and how such test cases are derived and developed. Automotive Cybersecurity. Best Practice Design Patterns.

Firm-Level Cybersecurity Risk and Idiosyncratic Volatility. The authors propose a measure of firm-level cybersecurity risk developed by employing pattern-based sequence-classification method from computational linguistics to determine the proportion of time devoted to issues related to cybersecurity risk during earnings conference calls. Using their measure, they investigate the effect of cybersecurity risk on firm-level return volatility. they examine both idiosyncratic volatility and implied volatility and find that firm-level cybersecurity risk is positively correlated to idiosyncratic volatility on the days on which earnings calls are held. This suggests that the discussion of issues related to cybersecurity risk during earnings calls is related to an increase in the component of the volatility that responds only to firm-specific news. That positive relationship is robust to alternative measurements of the language in earnings call discussions and to industry classifications. big data/machine learning. risk management.

Obérisk: Cybersecurity requirements elicitation through agile remote or face-to-face risk management brainstorming sessions. Cyberattacks make the news daily. Systems must be appropriately secured. Cybersecurity risk analyses are more than ever necessary, but … traveling and gathering in a room to discuss the topic has become difficult due to the COVID, whilst having a cybersecurity expert working isolated with an electronic support tool is clearly not the solution. In this article, we describe and illustrate Obérisk, an agile, cross-disciplinary and Obeya-like approach to risk management that equally supports face-to-face or remote risk management brainstorming sessions. The approach has matured for the last three years by using it for training and a wide range of real industrial projects. The overall approach is detailed and illustrated on a naval use case, with extensive feedback from the end-users. We show that Obérisk is really time-efficient and effective at managing risks at the early stages of a project, whilst remaining extremely low-cost. As the project grows or when the system is deployed, it may eventually be necessary to shift to a more comprehensive commercial electronic support tool. Agile. Brainstorming.

Quantifying Cybersecurity Effectiveness of Dynamic Network Diversity. The deployment of monoculture software stacks has devastating consequences because a single attack can compromise all of the vulnerable computers in cyberspace. This one-vulnerability-affects-all phenomenon will continue until after software stacks are diversified, which is well recognized by the research community. However, existing studies mainly focused on investigating the effectiveness of software diversity at the building-block level (e.g., whether two independent implementations indeed exhibit independent vulnerabilities). the effectiveness of enforcing network-wide software diversity is little understood, despite its importance in possibly helping justify investment in software diversification. As a first step towards ultimately tackling this problem, we propose a systematic framework for modeling and quantifying the cybersecurity effectiveness of network diversity, including a suite of cybersecurity metrics. We also present an agent-based simulation to empirically demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. We draw a number of insights, including the surprising result that proactive diversity is effective under very special circumstances, but reactive-adaptive diversity is much more effective in most cases.

A Moving Target Defense Strategy for Internet of Things Cybersecurity. Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming more common and present in our daily lives. The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers. with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system's configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy. this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems. The framework's objective is to find, after several iterations, the MTD strategy parameters that achieve a balance between five different measurable variables of an IoT system. cybersecurity. framework.

The Use of Digital Technology Platforms in the Context of Cybersecurity in the Industrial Sector. This study discusses the use of digital technology platforms (DTPs) in the context of cyber-security in the industrial sector, with a focus on digital industry (industrial) platforms (DIPs). A definition of DTPs is presented, including the author's interpretation, as well as the scope of DTP application in the industrial sector, which includes, in particular, European Digital Platforms (EDPs) and Polish Digital Platforms (PDPs), such as non-ferrous metals PDP or intelligent transport systems PDP. This is followed by a section covering the theoretical basis of the study that highlights the key challenges and risks associated with the use of DTPs as well as the methods for their neutralization in the form of specific concepts and systems that can be employed in the industrial sector. The subsequent section of the study is based on results of the author's own survey which collected information from a total of 120 companies operating in Poland, which were granted subsidies under the Operational Program Innovative Economy for investments involving the implementation and development of DTPs. The survey was carried out using a questionnaire developed by the author, which consisted of 23 questions. In this respect, as shown by the author's own studies, of greatest relevance are hardware failures and Internet outage events. Most importantly, concerns about such risks are some of the major factors underlying the negative attitudes of management staff of industrial companies toward DTPs, and therefore, it is so important to ensure that any such risks can be effectively addressed. They can be avoided through the use of certain concepts and systems such as STOE or CVSS. A typical company may know the model of DTPs in the context of challenges in the field of cybersecurity through this study. in particular, it can improve IT security. cybersecurity. digital technology platforms. industrial sector. platform economy. risks. 
Humans in the Loop: Cybersecurity Aspects in the Consumer IoT Context. With the growing popularity of the consumer Internet of Things devices in the society, there is an urgent need to understand the associated security and privacy risks. Currently, the consumer electronics (CE) community largely ignore the humans in the loop, while framing cybersecurity solutions in the IoT context. In this work, we stress on the need toward a human-centric approach to cybersecurity by shifting focus from humans as a problem to humans as a solution. We propose a Security & Privacy Preserving framework for illustrating how a human-centric approach can be initiated, what are its important components, and how security and privacy can be preserved with a human focus. We hope that the findings will help the CE community to realize the importance of a human-centric approach. 
Cybersecurity Challenges for Manufacturing Systems 4.0: Assessment of the Business Impact Level. An ever-growing number of companies are moving toward the Industry 4.0 paradigm, adopting a range of advanced technologies (e.g., smart sensors, big data analytics, and cloud computing) and networking their manufacturing systems. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of operations but also introduces new cybersecurity challenges. In this article, the impact assessment methodology is applied in the context of manufacturing systems 4.0 (also known as smart manufacturing systems, cyber manufacturing systems, or digital manufacturing systems), thus identifying the critical assets to be protected against cyber-attacks and assessing the business impacts in the case of subtractive and additive technologies. The research design of the single case study with multiple units of analysis is applied. In particular, a large company, a leader in the manufacturing of aeronautical components, is considered a representative case study, and its two main types of manufacturing cells that is, those based on networked computer numerical control machines and 3-D printers, are taken as applicative cases for the methodology. The application of the impact assessment methodology in the manufacturing context 4.0 of aeronautical components represents a useful guide for researchers in the field of cybersecurity and for companies intending to implement it in their smart manufacturing environments. In particular, based on this study, companies can define the critical manufacturing data to protect against cyber-attacks, isolate the business impacts in case of cybersecurity breaches, correlate the identified business impacts with the specific data category, and assess the level of business impacts.

Attack scenarios based on UNECE automotive cybersecurity regulation (UNR155). As the global automotive market is expected to grow more rapidly, concerns for security attacks or vulnerabilities are increasing as well. In order to prevent these risks, UNECE UNR 155 has been discussed, which is one of the influential automotive cyber security regulations. However, many global OEMs and parts suppliers are having difficulty understanding the concerned automotive attack surfaces and threats or vulnerabilities to satisfy the requirements of UNR 155. hi this paper, we classified major automotive attack surfaces into four categories according to communication range and purpose. Furthermore, we derived the possible attack scenarios with the attack surface, precondition, impact, and feasibility based on UNR 155 Annex 5 - Part A. Copyright . Attack scenario.

Cyber security using machine learning: Techniques and business applications. Machine learning has become an imperative innovation for cybersecurity. It preemptively gets rid of digital dangers and supports security foundation utilizing different methods. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, utilizes formulas constructed from historical databases and observable analysis to create presumptions regarding the actions of a machine. The machine would then be able to alter its activities—and even perform capacities for which it hasn’t been unequivocally modified. With its capacity to figure out a huge number of records and distinguish conceivably risky ones, machine learning is progressively being utilized to reveal dangers and naturally squash them before they can unleash ruin. Looking at the numerous benefits, this chapter tries to explore the various forms of cyberattacks and the application of Machine Learning in handling these attacks and thereby increasing cyber security. The chapter then evaluates the various techniques of Machine Learning and how organizations could take advantage of these techniques. In the last, it addresses Machine Learning’s potential opportunities for cyber security. Cyber security. Cyber threats. Data security. Machine learning. ML. ML applications. ML techniques. 
Cybersecurity: Perceived Threats and Policy Responses in the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a political and economic union of the Arab states, comprising some of the fastest growing economies in the world due to the prevalence of oil and gas industry and more recently due to significant investments in the digital economy. However, in recent years, rates of cybercrime and cyber-threats have risen significantly, posing challenges to the security and economic performance of the region. This article deals with the necessity to engage in transnational cooperation to counter the complex challenges posed by cybercrime across the GCC. Interviews were held with members of the GCC political elite who hold expertise in cybersecurity affairs. An analysis is presented of cybersecurity threats in the region, problems of strategic cooperation and lack of dialogue to tackle common challenges in the areas of cybercrime and cybersecurity. Finally, specific aspects of GCC cybersecurity policy are discussed: preventive and mitigation actions. potential intraregional and international cooperation avenues. and the formulation of effective strategy to enhance cybersecurity capabilities and resilience. Although grounded in the GCC as a regional bloc, the findings also carry implications for other contexts, especially other Middle East and North Africa countries and, thus, represent a promising avenue for future research.

A Cybersecurity Educated Community. The need for cybersecurity education has grown significantly for all citizens. However, cybersecurity education has not been adequately addressed in fields outside of this domain. Cybersecurity concerns increase every time a new device connects to a network. As such, we need to increase involvement and advancement of cybersecurity education at all levels and in every discipline. Education, audit, and enforcement regarding cybersecurity are critical aspects and are the responsibility of all system stakeholders. It is no longer enough to rely on the security team to be responsible for combating cyber threats. Involvement and commitment from all stakeholders are essential and universal and begins with a cross-disciplinary reform in education. In this paper, the need to deliver cybersecurity education across all disciplines and at all levels is discussed. Specifically, the focus is at the following four types of users: K-12, college, technical professionals, and all other citizens. A curriculum roadmap that integrates cybersecurity throughout technical and nontechnical curricula is proposed as a foundation for future cyber education planning. The goal is to introduce students and citizens to the concept of cybersecurity, to ensure they can apply cybersecurity concepts, and to expose them to multiple approaches to solving cybersecurity related problems.

Cybersecurity attacks on CAN bus based vehicles: a review and open challenges. Purpose: Nowadays, connected vehicles are becoming quite complex systems which are made up of different devices. In such a vehicle, there are several electronic control units (ECUs) that represent basic units of computation. These ECUs communicate with each other over the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus protocol which ensures a high communication rate. Even though it is an efficient standard which provides communication for in-vehicle networks, it is prone to various cybersecurity attacks. This paper aims to present a systematic literature review (SLR) which focuses on potential attacks on CAN bus networks. Then, it surveys the solutions proposed to overcome these attacks. In addition, it investigates the validation strategies aiming to check their accuracy and correctness. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have adopted the SLR methodology to summarize existing research papers that focus on the potential attacks on CAN bus networks. In addition, they compare the selected papers by classifying them according to the adopted validation strategies. They identify also gaps in the existing literature and provide a set of open challenges that can significantly improve the existing works. Findings: The study showed that most of the examined papers adopted the simulation as a validation strategy to imitate the system behavior and evaluate a set of performance criteria. Nevertheless, a little consideration has been given to the formal verification of the proposed systems. Originality/value: Unlike the existing surveys, this paper presents the first SLR that identifies local and remote security attacks that can compromise in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communications. Moreover, it compares the reviewed papers while focusing on the used validation strategies. Attacks. CAN bus. Cybersecurity. Review. Validation. Vehicles. 
Cyber security for smart system in industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 represents last generation in terms of production methods and implementation of new technologies in the manufacturing process. In the last decade it has known an immense development that managed to combine very effectively numerous technologies, low cost computing and ever-expanding networking, implemented in the very core of the factory. Because of its necessity of being integrated with other elements that come to complete the business enviroment such as connectivity between devices, analysis or human interaction, it must be taken into consideration all of the aspects that may interfere and alter the entire production process. When it comes to this, concerning that the entire industry is based on electronic or networking devices, they are used by people that need to be careful with the confidentiality of their accounts and passwords, the information circulating on the transmission medium may have a certain level of privacy, cyber security must be treated with greater importance. This paper introduces some elements that come in the composition of the Industy 4.0, benefits of it, and especially concepts of IoT security, security of the transport medium or cloud security and it describes in detail an infrasctructure model that those conceps can be applied on. It represents a portrayal of the central aspects and challenges that a still young industry has to take notice in order that it achieves its true potential. Cloud. Cyber security. Cyber-attacks.

Framework, Tools and Good Practices for Cybersecurity Curricula. Cybersecurity education and training are essential prerequisites of achieving a secure and privacy-friendly digital environment. Both professionals and the general public widely acknowledge the need for high-quality university education programs and professional training courses. However, guides, recommendations, practical tools, and good examples that could help institutions design appropriate cybersecurity programs are still missing. In particular, a comprehensive method to identify skills needed by cybersecurity work roles offered on the job market is missing. This paper aims to provide practical tools and strategies to help higher education providers design good cybersecurity curricula. First, we analyze the content of 89 existing study programs worldwide, collect recommendations of renowned institutions within and outside the EU, and provide a comprehensive survey accompanied by a dynamic web application called Education Map. Based on the knowledge about the current state in cybersecurity education, we design the SPARTA Cybersecurity Skills Framework that provides the currently missing link between work roles and required expertise and shows how to develop a curriculum that reflects job market requirements. Finally, we provide a practical tool that implements the framework and helps education and training providers design new study programs and analyze existing ones by considering the requirements of cybersecurity work roles. curricula design.

What small businesses in developing country think of cybersecurity risks in the digital age: Indonesian case. Purpose: This study aims to identify and analyse the issues faced by internet-based small businesses in developing countries regarding cybersecurity and document how these businesses address the risks. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the qualitative method. Respondents were internet-based small businesses selected by using theoretical sampling. Data were collected by using interviews and observations. The validity of the analysis was ensured by using triangulation and member checking. Findings: This study reveals that small businesses managed to identify the loss of physical and monetary assets as possible damage. However, only a few businesses identified loss of intangible assets as possible cyber risks. Most small businesses had used basic cybersecurity measures to protect data access and some primary business activities. Unfortunately, they rarely take initiatives in preventing and early detecting cyber risks. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study cannot be generalised as it aims to obtain new insights and document unexplored findings. Thus, if this study’s findings are going to be generalised, it is necessary to conduct an additional study. Secondly, this study did not assess how far small business had fulfilled the relevant information security framework as assessment required additional research, and this study only aimed to map the current situation in small businesses. Practical implications: This study emphasised the importance of identifying valuable assets or resources when implementing cybersecurity measures. Focusing on security measures to protect identified assets from cyber risk will make the efforts more efficient and effective than using standardised cybersecurity measures. Third-party developers can also use this study to understand small businesses’ current cybersecurity implementation and their characters to design online platforms that suit these needs. Governments can also design educational activities that address small businesses’ lack of knowledge. Originality/value: Most studies which focus on small businesses and information technology (IT) usually only discuss how they use IT. This study also brings new contributions by focusing on developing countries and specifically addresses internet-based technology cyber risk faced by e-commerce businesses. The qualitative method is used as most studies in e-commerce adoption were positivistic in nature, and inductive-based studies were rarely found on the topic. Cybersecurity risk.

Cybersecurity risk assessment method of ICS based on attack-defense tree model. Cybersecurity risk assessment is an important means of effective response to network attacks on industrial control systems. However, cybersecurity risk assessment process is susceptible to subjective and objective effects. To solve this problem, this paper introduced cybersecurity risk assessment method based on fuzzy theory of Attack-Defense Tree model and probability cybersecurity risk assessment technology, and applied it to airport automatic fuel supply control system. Firstly, an Attack-Defense Tree model was established based on the potential cybersecurity threat of the system and deployed security equipment. Secondly, the interval probability of the attack path was calculated using the triangular fuzzy quantification of the interval probabilities of the attack leaf nodes and defensive leaf nodes. Next, the interval probability of the final path was defuzzified. Finally, the occurrence probability of each final attack path was obtained and a reference for the deployment of security equipment was provided. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) considering the distribution of equipment in industrial control system, a new cybersecurity risk evaluation model of industrial control system is proposed. (2) The experimental results of this article are compared with other assessment technologies, and the trend is similar to that of other evaluation methods, which proves that the method was introduced in this paper is scientific. However, this method reduces the subjective impact of experts on cybersecurity risk assessment, and the assessment results are more objective and reasonable. (3) Applying this model to the airport oil supply automatic control system can comprehensively evaluate risk, solve the practical problems faced by the airport, and also provide an important basis for the cybersecurity protection scheme of the energy industry. attack-defense tree.

A Survey on Cyber-Security of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to everything network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for the future research. IEEE. attacks. Communication system security.

Power Measurement-Based Vulnerability Assessment of IoT Medical Devices at Varying Countermeasures for Cybersecurity. A method for the vulnerability assessment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) medical transducers cybersecurity at varying the power countermeasures is proposed. The implemented countermeasures reinforce the most popular cryptographic algorithm, advanced encryption standard (AES), running on a low-cost, low-energy, and low-performance smart transducer for IoT medical devices. The proposed method is based on attacks standardized in the smart-card industry: differential power analysis (DPA) and correlation power analysis (CPA). Adopting a methodically rigorous framework, a boost for the study of power countermeasures was offered for IoT medical transducers. An experimental comparison of security performance among different power countermeasures was realized. Each countermeasure increases the number of power traces needed to discover the AES secret key. Random delay, random SBox, and masking strengthen the AES of 1.3, 208, and 318 factors, respectively. The masking countermeasure was by far the most effective.

On Aggregation and Prediction of Cybersecurity Incident Reports. The study of cybersecurity incidents is an active research field. The purpose of this work is to determine accurate measures of cybersecurity incidents. An effective method to aggregate cybersecurity incident reports is defined to set these measures. As a result we are able to make predictions and, therefore, to deploy security policies. Forecasting time-series of those cybersecurity aggregates is performed based on Koopman's method and Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm. Both techniques have shown to be accurate for a wide variety of dynamical systems ranging from fluid dynamics to social sciences. We have performed some experiments on public databases. We show that the measure of the risk trend can be effectively forecasted. 37N40 (Dynamical systems in optimization and economics). 62-07 (Data analysis).. 65F20 (Overdetermined systems and pseudo-inverses). 68T10 (Pattern recognition). 93A30 (Mathematical modeling).

The relationship between online political participation and privacy protection: evidence from 10 Asian societies of different levels of cybersecurity. Information disclosure during online political activities can place participants under the threat of personal data leakage and misuse, but privacy protection in the context of online political participation has rarely been studied. This study examined how online political participation is related to privacy protection behaviours. Using survey data of internet users from 10 Asian societies, our study suggests two important findings. First, online political participation was found to be positively related to privacy protection behaviours. Second, we examined whether such a positive association can be explained by two mediators: perceived privacy risk and internet efficacy, in countries of different cybersecurity capacity. Our data suggest that internet efficacy mediates the relationship between online political participation and privacy protection behaviours across countries with different levels of cybersecurity capacity, while perceived privacy risk only mediates the effects of online political participation on privacy protection behaviours in countries of low cybersecurity capacity. cross-nation. cybersecurity.

Statistical indicators of cybersecurity development in the context of digital transformation of economy and society [СТАТИСТИЧНІ ІНДИКАТОРИ РОЗВИТКУ КІБЕРБЕЗПЕКИ В КОНТЕКСТІ ЦИФРОВОЇ ТРАНСФОРМАЦІЇ ЕКОНОМІКИ Й СУСПІЛЬСТВА]. Introduction. The scale and destructive consequences of the unlawful impact on cyberspace is a key problem of modern geopolitics, and cyber reliability is recognized as one of the most important security priorities by the subjects of international relations. Problem Statement. Monitoring of cyber incidents and anomalies in information and communication systems and prompt response to risks determined by cyber threats require the development of a system of indicators and criteria for cybersecurity assessment. Purpose. Summarize the international experience of assessing the cybersecurity, to position countries by their level of development in the global space, to identify strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity management, and to ensure effective protection of cyberspace at the national level. Materials and Methods. Used the component indices of the international rankings characterizing the potential of the digital economy (ICT IDI, NRI, EGDI) and the participation of countries in the field of cybersecurity (GCI and NCSI). Results. It has been argued that cybersecurity ratings play the role of a kind of identifier of the relative advantages and vulnerabilities of the national cyber strategies, and indicate the need for their review in order to strengthen protection against cyber-attacks and improve the cyber risk management system. In countries with a high level of economic development, which is largely based on the contribution of IT technologies to the national production, the cybersecurity potential is significantly higher, regardless of geolocation. The discovered correlation between GCI, information society development indices (IDI, NRI, EGDI) and GDP per capita confirms that the digital transformation of the economy and society acts as a key driver of economic development if the information- and cyber-security are assured only. The best practices are highlighted, and critically weak segments of the national cybersecurity are identified. Conclusions. Using the NCSI indicators, the preparedness of Georgia and Ukraine to prevent the implementation of fundamental cyber threats and to manage cyber incidents and large-scale cyber crises is assessed.

Efficient opto MVC/HEVC cybersecurity framework based on arnold map and discrete cosine transform. The rapid increase in Internet and social media services results in many cybercriminals that cause a significant deterioration in Internet security with massive unwanted consequences. Encryption technology can be employed to provide data security in digital multimedia communications. From this scene, this paper studies and proposes an efficient optical Multiview Video Coding/High-Efficiency Video Coding (MVC/HEVC) cybersecurity framework using chaotic Arnold map Transform (AMT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the secure transmission of MVC/HEVC data. The proposed AMT-DCT-based optical MVC/HEVC cybersecurity framework consists has two stages. In the first stage, the video frames are shuffled using the AMT, multiplied by the initial random phase mask (RPM1), and decomposed with the DCT. In the second stage, the DCT shuffled video frames are secondly shuffled using the AMT, modulated with the second random phase mask (RPM2), and decomposed with the inverse of DCT to obtain the finally encrypted video frames. The usage of AMT as a pre-processing shuffling process guarantees the advantages of noise resistance. Experiments prove that the proposed AMT-DCT-based optical MVC/HEVC cybersecurity scheme can withstand various multimedia attacks compared to the literature work. Arnold transform. DCT. HEVC.

Internal auditing and cyber security: Audit role and procedural contribution. Businesses operate in a dynamic environment that is constantly changing and in which they are undermined by various risks. One in particular, is that of cyber security. Internal auditors, through their multifaceted role, can contribute to the reduction of the information systems' violation. Extant works, nevertheless, on the connection between internal audit and cyber security worldwide, are scant, and practically non-existent for the case of Greece. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the variables that influence cyber security and which, at the same time, are relevant to internal audit. In this context, methodologically, a questionnaire was distributed to companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange and addressed to their internal auditors. The findings of the survey identified key factors impacting cyber security, including the degree and nature of cooperation between IT staff and auditors, and training regarding information technology.

Organisation of the national system of cybersecurity: Selected issues [Organizacja krajowego systemu cyberbezpieczeństwa. Wybrane zagadnienia]. The issues discussed in this paper concern cybersecurity. The threats present in cyberspace are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, and their prevention requires not only knowledge and special equipment, but also considerable financial resources. As such, the State has to put a great deal of effort (both institutional and financial) into cybersecurity measures directed against attacks. In order to meet the challenges connected with ensuring cybersecurity, the legislators have undertaken the regulation of such issues by adopting laws on the national cybersecurity system to allow the responsible authorities to properly secure cyberspace against threats. As part of the national cybersecurity system, lawmakers have imposed a number of obligations on public entities to ensure that information systems are resistant to actions which compromise the confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, and authenticity of processed data, and the related services offered by such systems. Appropriate obligations have also been exacted on the operators of essential services (OES), i.e. services key to maintaining critical social or economic activities which are included in the list of essential services.

Cybersecurity’s grammars: A more-than-human geopolitics of computation. On one June afternoon in 2017, during an autoethnography of a malware analysis and detection laboratory, NotPetya quickly caused destruction. This malware has since been characterised as a key geopolitical event in cybersecurity, causing billions of dollars in damage as it rendered inoperable computers across the world. The hunt to identify those who had written NotPetya occurred almost immediately. However, this paper rearticulates this event through grammar, in a close reading of computation, to urge for a more-than-human reading of cybersecurity. By exploring the written propositions of the hackers, various computational materials – including hardware, code, and machine learning algorithms – as well as their ecologies, cybersecurity is understood to be part of an ecology of language-practice. Engaging with N. Katherine Hayles’ study of non-human cognition and choice, computation has an ability to read, interpret, and act, and thus intervene. NotPetya is thus not only a tool of hackers but is a political actor which, alongside others, transformed the contours of the geopolitics of cybersecurity. By focusing on grammars, geopolitics does not wholly derive from the (white, male, rational) hacker, analyst, or intelligence agent, but rather from a distributed set of actors that speak to one another. Grammars permit a nuanced appreciation of cyber-attacks, the hacker's handling of computational cognition and choice, as well as conceptualising the relation between author and computation and the risks of machine learning. Cybersecurity, through grammar, then becomes one of co-authorship where security is not only performed by humans but is contorted by an alien politics of computation.

Reconfiguring governance: How cyber security regulations are reconfiguring water governance. Developments in improved monitoring, asset management, and resource efficiencies led to the water industry promising a step-change in the design and operation of these facilities: the blending of traditional engineering equipment with digital technologies. These apparent benefits inevitably produce new challenges of regulating an emerging techno-political landscape. One of the regulations is Europe's Network and Information Systems Security Directive, which aims to improve cyber security across critical infrastructure providers. This paper focuses on the implementation of Network and Information Systems in the context of the water sector in England. At the national and supranational levels, Network and Information Systems acts as a boundary object that gathers diverse communities of practice without the need to establish common goals. Further, in the process of transposing the Directive into the sectoral context, Network and Information Systems requires interpretation by expert communities. We show how translating the regulatory scope to the sectoral landscape involves prioritizing some water governance goals over others. As diverse expert communities converge in their collaboration practices, their priorities align or stand in tension with public interests. We argue that cyber security regulations have potential to reconfigure water governance by refocusing strategic priorities away from traditional concerns of environmental governance. We suggest ways to maintain diverse collaborations across engineering, computing, and water expertise that Network and Information Systems implementation remains aligned with the goals of water governance. critical infrastructure. cyber security. expertise. regulation. science and technology studies. 
Exploring The Correlation between Cyber Security Awareness, Protection Measures and the State of Victimhood: The Case Study of Ambo University’s Academic Staffs. The advancement of information communication technology has triggered a revolution in using the Internet for legitimate educational purposes on university campuses. Therefore, the Internet has changed the way of human communication and contributed to the development of mankind. On the other hand it is regrettable that its revolution has helped malicious users to exploit it for the malign purpose to commit a cyberspace crime that has in turn negatively affected fellow users who were preyed on by cyber predators. This work aimed to examine the awareness of cybersecurity, the measures taken to protect against cyberattacks and the state of victimization among professors at Ambo University. Thus, the present study comes up with the following findings. First, the result shows that the respondents’ cybersecurity awareness was significantly influenced by cyber-crime victimization, fields of study, and protection measures. Second, the current study also depicts that the respondents’ protection measures were connected to and influenced by cybercrime victimization, education level, and cyber-security awareness. Finally, the study’s findings show that being a cyber-crime victim has been linked to predictors’ variables: protection measures and the level of cybersecurity awareness.

A collaborative approach for national cybersecurity incident management. Purpose: Collaborative-based national cybersecurity incident management benefits from the huge size of incident information, large-scale information security devices and aggregation of security skills. However, no existing collaborative approach has been able to cater for multiple regulators, divergent incident views and incident reputation trust issues that national cybersecurity incident management presents. This paper aims to propose a collaborative approach to handle these issues cost-effectively. Design/methodology/approach: A collaborative-based national cybersecurity incident management architecture based on ITU-T X.1056 security incident management framework is proposed. It is composed of the cooperative regulatory unit with cooperative and third-party management strategies and an execution unit, with incident handling and response strategies. Novel collaborative incident prioritization and mitigation planning models that are fit for incident handling in national cybersecurity incident management are proposed. Findings: Use case depicting how the collaborative-based national cybersecurity incident management would function within a typical information and communication technology ecosystem is illustrated. The proposed collaborative approach is evaluated based on the performances of an experimental cyber-incident management system against two multistage attack scenarios. The results show that the proposed approach is more reliable compared to the existing ones based on descriptive statistics. Originality/value: The approach produces better incident impact scores and rankings than standard tools. The approach reduces the total response costs by 8.33% and false positive rate by 97.20% for the first attack scenario, while it reduces the total response costs by 26.67% and false positive rate by 78.83% for the second attack scenario.

Corporate management boards’ information security orientation: an analysis of cybersecurity incidents in DAX 30 companies. Our study analyzes the impact of cybersecurity incidents (CSIs) at executive level in German blue-chip companies between 2005 and 2018. Using Upper Echelons Theory, we examine the effect of CSIs on both the composition of management boards as well as their members’ profiles and related responsibilities, performing a qualitative in-depth analysis of the positive cases found. Our results show that while CSIs are a common problem for large German groups, only a few of them have addressed IT-related incidents directly through governance. Firms that reacted strongly went against the general trend, and either added a new functional unit to the management board or strengthened functions related to the issue. Our findings indicate that German blue-chip companies have not yet devised a common strategy to deal with CSIs. Firms that reshape their management boards tend instead to take a more compliance-oriented approach. Cybersecurity incidents. Germany. Management boards. Security management. 
COVID-19 Age: Challenges in cybersecurity and possible solution domains. Threats to cybersecurity and cyberattacks respect no boundaries. Cybercriminals always try to exploit any crisis to facilitate their attacks, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic is not an exception. From the very first beginning of the COVID-19 virus outbreak in March 2020, it has become very effective tool to commit cybercrimes as it has not only triggered huge upheavals in health, education, and the economy but has also led to broad implications on communication and information technology as well. In line with the increasing number and scope of cyberattacks, the growing concern caused by the pandemic has increased the possibility of successful cyberattacks. The significance of this paper is to highlight and review some types of cyberattacks associated with the COVID-19 presence. In addition, the paper recommends some guidelines and countermeasures for the micro-level of families, individuals and for business enterprise to implement potential means of risk management plans to actively mitigate and control the consequences of such malicious attacks.

Restrictions on trade in telecommunications: Wto’s cybersecurity conundrum. This article examines the role of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in balancing the nexus among a rule-based multilateral trade system, national security, and cybersecurity. It presents a historical account of restrictions placed on the telecommunications trade over national security concerns and focuses on the significant political risks thereof for the WTO if these restrictions are challenged at its dispute settlement system. An analysis based on the WTO Panel rulings in ‘Russia – Traffic in Transit’ and ‘Saudi Arabia – Protection of IPRs’ is revealing in this context. It shows that, despite the obvious cybersecurity concerns, the invocation of the national security exception is not straightforward. The turn to power politics and regionalism highlights the significance of multilateral organizations that provide a more inclusive structure to reflect and protect the interests of all their members, not just those that hold positions of power and control. As long as the stalemate at organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) continues, despite the need for a more legitimate, inclusive multilateral framework, the expectation of a ruling on trade-related aspects of cyberse-curity will place an unnecessary burden on the WTO dispute settlement system.

Exploring Cybersecurity Ecosystem in the Middle East: Towards an SME Recommender System. Cybersecurity is described as the protection of data resources by treating threats that jeopardize data. Enterprises must manage the cybersecurity risks so that the security and resilience of their assets may be improved. Cyberattacks on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are rising. However, they often lack effective strategies to prevent threats such as malware, phishing, denial of service (DoS), and others. Their weak defense system is often an attractive avenue for hackers to explore loopholes. There is a lack of cybersecurity initiatives in SMEs, and several past attacks have exposed the weak systems. This paper first attempts to investigate the current scenario of cybersecurity in the context of Middle East SMEs. A survey of SMEs in the Middle East (cybersecurity space) helped understand the existing scenario, actual requirements, and challenges SMEs face. The research then explores the need for SMEs to choose the apt security solution to cater to their business needs. By reviewing the existing standards and pointers in different parts of the world, this research proposes a cybersecurity recommender system for SMEs in the Middle East. One of the survey findings reveals that most SMEs require adequate cybersecurity awareness, followed by evaluating the organization's preventive capabilities. The dearth of information available online and the IT consultants' conflicting guidance usually creates an information overload in deciding a neutral solution to address their needs. The recommender system attempts to structure the information available as a framework in deciding a cybersecurity solution for SMEs. cloud. Cybersecurity. endpoints. framework. IT awareness.

Development of organization, social and individual cyber security awareness model (Osicsam) for the elderly. This paper proposes a cyber security awareness model for the elderly. The massive use of internet has led towards cybercriminals like scamming, fraud, hacking and cyber bullying. It has been reported that the number of cyber security incidents is increasing and among the affected group is the elderly. In line with the government initiative for cyber security, therefore, this study aims to develop a cyber security awareness model for the elderly. Firstly, a feasibility study was conducted and several literatures related to cyber security awareness and the elderly’s learning styles were reviewed thoroughly. Secondly, based on the literatures, the existing cyber security awareness models were analyzed by identifying the approaches used. Thirdly, the learning styles of the elderly were studied based on the elderly’s impairments and concerns. Finally, the cyber security awareness models were mapped to the elderly’s learning styles. Based on the mapping results, a cyber security awareness model has been developed for the elderly based on the Information Security Awareness Capability Model (ISACM), Information Security Awareness Program (ISAPM) General Model, Peer Education Model, and Security Awareness Model. The expected result of this study is a cyber security model consists of the involvement of organization, social and individual factors that are important in creating cyber security awareness for the elderly. Further works are recommended to analyse the effectiveness of the proposed model towards the elderly and experts’ reviews are required. Adult. Cyber security. Cyber-attack. Modelling. Peer education.

Cybersecurity challenges and the academic health center: An interactive tabletop simulation for executives. Problem Academic health centers (AHCs) face cybersecurity vulnerabilities that have potential costs to an institution's finances, reputation, and ability to deliver care. Yet many AHC executives may not have sufficient knowledge of the potential impact of cyberattacks on institutional missions such as clinical care, research, and education. Improved cybersecurity awareness and education are areas of opportunity for many AHCs. Approach The authors developed and facilitated a tabletop cybersecurity simulation at an international conference for AHC leaders in September 2019 to raise awareness of cybersecurity issues and threats and to provide a forum for discussions of concerns specific to CEOs and C-suite-level executives. The 3.5-hour interactive simulation used an evolving, 3-phase case study describing a hypothetical cyberattack on an AHC with a ransomware demand. The approximately 70 participants, from AHCs spanning 25 states and 11 countries, worked in teams and discussed how they would react if they held roles similar to their real-life positions. The authors provide the full scenario as a resource. Outcomes The exercise was well received by the participants. In the postsession debrief, many participants noted that cybersecurity preparedness had not received the level of institutional attention given to threats such as epidemics or natural disasters. Significant variance in teams' courses of action during the simulation highlighted a lack of consensus with regard to foundational decisions. Participants identified this as an area that could be remedied by the development of guidelines or protocols. Next Steps As health care cybersecurity challenges persist or grow in magnitude, AHCs will have increased opportunities to lead in the development of best practices for preparedness and response. AHCs are well positioned to work with clinicians, security professionals, regulators, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to develop tools and protocols to improve health care cybersecurity and better protect patients. 
Machine learning-based intrusion detection for achieving cybersecurity in smart grids using IEC 61850 GOOSE messages. Increased connectivity is required to implement novel coordination and control schemes. IEC 61850-based communication solutions have become popular due to many reasons—object-oriented modeling capability, interoperable connectivity and strong communication protocols, to name a few. However, communication infrastructure is not well-equipped with cybersecurity mechanisms for secure operation. Unlike online banking systems that have been running such security systems for decades, smart grid cybersecurity is an emerging field. To achieve security at all levels, operational technology-based security is also needed. To address this need, this paper develops an intrusion detection system for smart grids utilizing IEC 61850’s Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messages. The system is developed with machine learning and is able to monitor the communication traffic of a given power system and distinguish normal events from abnormal ones, i.e., attacks. The designed system is implemented and tested with a realistic IEC 61850 GOOSE message dataset under symmetric and asymmetric fault conditions in the power system. The results show that the proposed system can successfully distinguish normal power system events from cyberattacks with high accuracy. This ensures that smart grids have intrusion detection in addition to cybersecurity features attached to exchanged messages. Artificial intelligence. GOOSE message security. IEC 62351.

Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Cybersecurity. This study examines the cybersecurity responses by organizations to threats. Based on the notions of exploration and exploitation, this study developed a 2 × 2 matrix to characterize organizational actions as Surviving, Investigating, Reinforcing, and Balancing. Using textual data gathered from the annual 10–K reports of 87 organizations, this study mapped the explorative and exploitative behaviors of organizations and characterized the cybersecurity responses with the 2 × 2 matrix. This study also identified the changes in cybersecurity responses over multiple time periods, and the patterns of shifts between the quadrants in the 2 × 2 matrix as organizations adapted their cybersecurity responses over time. Several implications for research and practice are discussed. ambidexterity. Cybersecurity response. exploitation. exploration. quadrant analysis. 
A Conceptual Model for Cybersecurity Governance. Cybersecurity is a growing problem associated with everything an individual or an organization does that is facilitated by the Internet. It is a multi-facetted program that can be addressed by cybersecurity governance. However, research has shown that many organizations face at least five basic challenges of cybersecurity. In this study, we developed a model for an effective cybersecurity governance that hopes to address these challenges, conceptualized as factors that must continuously be measured and evaluated. They are: (1) Cybersecurity strategy. (2) Standardized processes, (3) Compliance, (4) Senior leadership oversight, and (5) Resources.

The cybersecurity governance in changing the security psychology and security posture: Insights into e-procurement. Security is a consistent and growing concern for e-commerce and e-procurement solutions which demand for secure transactions to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. E-procurement is vulnerable to cyberattacks resulting in increasing demand for cybersecurity governance. Cybersecurity governance is needed to manage the cyberattacks and ensure the important assets of the company is well protected. The aim of this study is to identify the practices for an effective cybersecurity governance by examining and synthesising existing cybersecurity and cybersecurity governance maturity models and framework from the literature and industry. This study has selected and compared prominent cybersecurity maturity models such as cybersecurity governance maturity model (CSGMM) and cyber preparedness (cyber prep) framework by adapting the taxonomy of software improvement environments method. From the synthesis, 12 practical measures were identified and recommended to manufacturing firms for an effective cybersecurity governance. Copyright . CSGMM. Cyber prep. Cyber preparedness.

A MATURITY FRAMEWORK FOR CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE IN ORGANIZATIONS. Digitalization necessarily leads organizations to rethink their cybersecurity principles in order to counter all the risks inherent in cybercrime. Cybersecurity governance brings together all the essential elements of cyber defense and effective risk management. Without such governance, dangerous gaps persist, and assets are inevitably compromised. Given the critical decisions that need to be made in an ever-changing cyber threat environment, cybersecurity standards are a critical way for companies to ensure that their security strategy and policies are consistently and measurably implemented. The aim of this paper is to propose a capability maturity framework to assess and improve cybersecurity governance in organizations. The finding will help organizations to evaluate their cybersecurity governance capabilities. 
IoT cybersecurity threats mitigation via integrated technical and non-technical solutions. With the growing number of connected devices to the internet every day, and the rapid development and deployment of internet of things (IoT), the number of security threats and vulnerabilities posed to these are also increased. Also, the use of IoT in the industry has become a major requirement for digitalisation transformation and high-priority business demand to increase productivity and profitability. The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is concerned with making industrial environments more connected and thus smarter. However, this transformation comes with a huge number of threats that should be addressed. The primary goal of this research paper is to provide a technical solution as well as a holistic approach (framework) of security concerns. This will be supported by a number of non-technical factors to build a resilient cybersecurity model to effectively and efficiently mitigate cybersecurity threats. Copyright . Cybersecurity. IIoT.

A hierarchical method for assessing cyber security situation based on ontology and fuzzy cognitive maps. The hierarchical analysis method is widely used in the field of cyber security situation assessment. It is a key research topic. However, lots of them have paid less attention to the analysis of interrelationships among cyber security situation elements, and still have no effective cyber security events tracking capability. In this work, we proposed a hierarchical cyber security situation assessment method based on ontology and fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM). Firstly, we collected cyber security events from multiple ways and created a general cyber security risk events according to structured description of events based on ontology. Secondly, we generated semi-automatically the FCM structure according to general cyber security risk events using our FCM build method. Thirdly, we assessed and quantified cyber security situation based on ontology and FCM, and then determined the cyber security situation level according to relevant cyber security risk level table. At last, the cyber security events tracking capability was introduced. In our experiment, we used DARPA2000 dataset to verify and analyse our cyber security assessment method and explained tracing the high-risk events in target network. The result shows that our method can reflect the cyber security situation accurately and has the cyber security tracing capability. Copyright . Cyber security situation. FCM. Fuzzy cognitive maps.

CySecEscape 2.0-A virtual escape room to raise cybersecurity awareness. An increasing number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use the Internet to support and grow businesses. The application of new technologies comes with inherent risks of ever-changing cyberspace and increasing cybercrime. Previous research has shown that the human factor remains the core element in the cybersecurity chain. Therefore, it is paramount that employees receive effective training to acquire a security mindset. This study puts forward previous research that resulted in a portable escape room game to raise cybersecurity awareness. The purpose of the study is to elaborate the transformation of the physical game into a virtual learning experience to increase flexibility in times such as the Covid-19 lockdown. As main method, we applied the design science framework of Hevner et al. As main result, the research elaborates the design of the developed artifact-a virtual prototype of the escape room game addressing the cybersecurity challenges of SMEs. For the evaluation of the prototype, empirical data was collected in qualitative and quantitative form. As main conclusions, we have observed that a physical escape room can be transformed into a virtual setting with little means without sacrificing player immersion. A limitation was identified in teaching targeted social engineering attacks. Cybersecurity awareness. Design science research. Escape room game. Small and medium-sized enterprises. 
The Named Entity Recognition of Chinese Cybersecurity Using an Active Learning Strategy. In data-driven big data security analysis, knowledge graph-based multisource heterogeneous threat data organization, association mining, and inference analysis attach increasinginterest in the field of cybersecurity. Although the construction of knowledge graph based on deep learning has achieved great success, the construction of a largescale, high-quality, and domain-specific knowledge graph needs a manual annotation of large corpora, which means it is very difficult. To tackle this problem, we present a straightforward active learning strategy for cybersecurity entity recognition utilizing deep learning technology. BERT pre-trained model and residual dilation convolutional neural networks (RDCNN) are introduced to learn entity context features, and the conditional random field (CRF) layer is employed as a tag decoder. Then, taking advantages of the output results and distribution of cybersecurity entities, we propose an active learning strategy named TPCL that considers the uncertainty, confidence, and diversity. We evaluated TPCL on the general domain datasets and cybersecurity datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that TPCL performs better than the traditional strategies in terms of accuracy and F1. Moreover, compared with the general field, it has better performance in the cybersecurity field and is more suitable for the Chinese entity recognition task in this field. 
State of the art on the identification of unintentional cybersecurity threats by internal personnel in public institutions [Estado del arte sobre la identificación amenazas no intencionales de ciberseguridad de parte de personal interno en instituciones públicas]. The modernization of public administration has forced states around the world to develop digital electronic government services and, in turn, consider threats to the information assets with which they provide these services. Studies reveal that a large part of the origin of threats to cybersecurity in state entities comes from internal personnel, and those threats are unintentional. This paper presents a systematic review of the state of the art about frameworks, models and other proposals to identify unintentional cybersecurity threats produced by internal personnel in public institutions.

Cybersecurity breaches and the role of information technology governance in audit committee charters. Cybersecurity is a serious and growing risk for organizations. Firms with board of director involvement in information technology governance (ITG) may be better equipped to deal with this risk. Yet little is known about the audit committee’s role in ITG. This study uses efficiency and institutional theories to investigate the influence of security breaches and board-level technology committees on disclosing ITG roles in the audit committee charter. We develop hypotheses and test them using a sample of 189 firms. Results show that firms with a technology committee and a data breach are more likely to disclose ITG roles in the audit committee charter. This suggests that firms experiencing a data breach realize their vulnerability and, by already having oversight at the board level, it is more natural for them to increase oversight by assigning ITG roles to the audit committee. We provide implications and areas for future research. Audit committee charter. Cybersecurity. Data breach. Information technology governance. Technology committee. 
Detecting Insider Threat via a Cyber-Security Culture Framework. Insider threat has been recognized by both scientific community and security professionals as one of the gravest security hazards for private companies, institutions, and governmental organizations. Extended research on the types, associated internal and external factors, detection approaches and mitigation strategies has been conducted over the last decades. Various frameworks have been introduced in an attempt to understand and reflect the danger posed by this threat, whereas multiple identified cases have been classified in private or public databases. This paper aims to present how a cyber-security culture framework with a clear focus on the human factor can assist in detecting possible threats of both malicious and unintentional insiders. We link current insider threat categories with specific security domains of the framework and introduce an assessment methodology of the core contributing parameters. Specific approach takes into consideration technical, behavioral, cultural, and personal indicators and assists in identifying possible security perils deriving from privileged individuals. behavioral indicators. cyber-security culture framework. detection.

Assessing user’s susceptibility and awareness of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats, including those involving machine learning, mal-ware, phishing, and cryptocurrency, have become more sophisticated. They target sensitive information and put institutions, governments, and individuals in a con-tinual state of risk. In 2019, phishing attacks became one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats. Such attacks attempt to steal sensitive data, such as login and payment card details, from financial, social, and educational websites. Many universities have suffered data breaches, serving as a prime example of victims of attacks on educational websites. Owing to advances in phishing tactics, strategies, and technologies, the end-user is the main victim of an attack scenario. According to several studies, the end-user can play a significant role in preventing a phishing attack. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the levels of user awareness regarding cyber threats and explore the relationship between the knowledge on cybercrimes and the awareness of phishing, within the context of cybercrime targeting educational websites. An observational experiment using ‘think aloud’ method was conducted with 20 students from Taif University. The results indi-cated that although the participants demonstrated an advanced level of information technology experience as specialists in computer science and computer engineering, their susceptibility to phishing was high. The results of this study will contribute to the cybersecurity research field in terms of proposing risk management plans, delivering embedded training to end-users, and improving spam detecting tools.

Quantitative assessment of cybersecurity risks for mitigating data breaches in business systems. The evaluation of data breaches and cybersecurity risks has not yet been formally addressed in modern business systems. There has been a tremendous increase in the generation, usage and consumption of industrial and business data as a result of smart and computational intensive software systems. This has resulted in an increase in the attack surface of these cyber systems. Consequently, there has been a consequent increase in the associated cybersecurity risks. However, no significant studies have been conducted that examine, compare, and evaluate the approaches used by the risk calculators to investigate the data breaches. The development of an efficient cybersecurity solution allows us to mitigate the data breaches threatened by the cybersecurity risks such as cyber-attacks against database storage, processing and management. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive, formal model that estimates the two components of security risks: breach cost and the likelihood of a data breach within 12 months. The data used in this model are taken from the industrial business report, which provides the necessary information collected and the calculators developed by the major organizations in the field. This model integrated with the cybersecurity solution uses consolidated factors that have a significant impact on the data breach risk. We propose mathematical models of how the factors impact the cost and the likelihood. These models allow us to conclude that results obtained through the models mitigate the data breaches in the potential and future business system dynamically. Cybersecurity. Data breach cost.

State-industry relations and cybersecurity governance in Europe. Recent analyses of international affairs highlight that states are increasingly exploiting the key position of some private industries in critical hubs of global economic networks to gain an advantage over their competitors. The key role of private companies in international competition has also significant implications in the cyber-domain, where private actors are the main owners of data and digital infrastructures. In contrast to those who see a transformative effect of cyber, this article draws on comparative political economy and defense policy to identify two different models of state-industry relations in the governance of cybersecurity. The theoretical framework distinguishes between public and private governance ecosystems and identifies different hypotheses on how states and industries interact in cybersecurity governance in France and in the UK. The French public governance is characterized by the presence of formal and informal relations between state and industries, a high degree of public investment in the private sector and centralized institutions. France has also used the EU mainly to advance its industrial interests. In contrast, the UK private governance is characterized by more arm's length relations between the state and industries and a less centralized system. Moreover, the UK, differently to France, has not used the EU channel to advance its industry-related preferences. These results confirm the macro-differences between public and private governance ecosystems and open new relevant avenues to investigate the interplay between political economy structures and European and international pressures in policy-areas with both economic and security implications.

The impact of cybersecurity risk management examinations and cybersecurity incidents on investor perceptions and decisions. In response to cybersecurity risk and demand for information about organizations’ cybersecurity risk management programs, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) recently released a cybersecurity risk management examination service. We examine the effect of joint or separate provisioning of this service on investors’ perceptions and decisions, and whether these effects differ when a subsequent cybersecurity incident occurs. We find that the negative signal of a subsequent cybersecurity incident reverses investors’ positive perceptions of auditor competence and increases investors’ sensitivity to potential independence impairments when the cybersecurity is jointly provisioned, leading to lower perceptions of audit quality. We also find that investors are less willing to invest when the examination is jointly provisioned compared to separately provisioned. Our results provide important insights to the literature and to purchasers and regulators by examining an emerging non-audit service and how a signal of non-audit service quality can affect perceptions of audit quality.

Efficient three-dimensional video cybersecurity framework based on double random phase encoding. With the rapidly increasing rate of using online services and social media websites, cybercriminals have caused a great deterioration in the network security with enormous undesired consequences. Encryption techniques may be utilized to achieve data robustness and security in digital multimedia communication systems. From this perspective, this paper presents an optical ciphering framework using Double Random Phase Encoding (DRPE) for efficient and secure transmission of Three-Dimensional Videos (3DVs). Firstly, in the DRPE-based 3DV cybersecurity framework proposed in the paper, an optical emitter converts each frame of the transmitted 3DV into an optical signal. Then, the DRPE technique encrypts the obtained optical signal using two kinds of phase modulation in the time and frequency domains. Lastly, a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) digital camera converts, upon detection, the optical cipher frames to digital format. The proposed DRPE-based 3DV cybersecurity framework is examined and investi-gated through visual inspection and various security statistical metrics. Experi-ments and analysis show that the proposed DRPE-based 3DV cybersecurity framework is secure and effective to mitigate different multimedia attacks. DRPE. Multimedia cybersecurity.

An automated system to predict popular cybersecurity news using document embeddings. The substantial competition among the news industries puts editors under the pressure of posting news articles which are likely to gain more user attention. Anticipating the popularity of news articles can help the editorial teams in making decisions about posting a news article. Article similarity extracted from the articles posted within a small period of time is found to be a useful feature in existing popularity prediction approaches. This work proposes a new approach to estimate the popularity of news articles by adding semantics in the article similarity based approach of popularity estimation. A semantically enriched model is proposed which estimates news popularity by measuring cosine similarity between document embeddings of the news articles. Word2vec model has been used to generate distributed representations of the news content. In this work, we define popularity as the number of times a news article is posted on different websites. We collect data from different websites that post news concerning the domain of cybersecurity and estimate the popularity of cybersecurity news. The proposed approach is compared with different models and it is shown that it outperforms the other models. Cosine similarity. Embeddings. Popularity. Semantics. Word2vec. 
Playing the Market Card: The Commission's Strategy to Shape EU Cybersecurity Policy. As EU security is an intergovernmental policy area, it has been assumed that the only relevant policy-shapers are member states. However, more recent analyses show that supranational actors, like the Commission, have developed strategies to enhance their role in this traditionally interstate realm. This article endorses this reasoning and intends to cast some light on these strategies. Building on Kingdon's concept of the policy entrepreneur and using EU's cybersecurity policy as an empirical case, we analyse the Commission's initiatives to draft a European response to cybercrime, in order to answer one central research question: how has the Commission managed to secure a prominent role in a highly salient security issue? The findings suggest that the Commission, acting as a policy entrepreneur, purposefully explored a market–security nexus in order to influence an otherwise intergovernmental security domain. Ultimately, the Commission was a much more relevant player than expected. cybercrime. cybersecurity. European Commission. policy entrepreneur. security policy. 
HOLISTIC HEALTHCARE CYBERSECURITY. The real and pervasive epidemic our nation is experiencing with burnout in multiple industries, to include healthcare and cyber. The common reasons for burnout are remarkably similar in high stress, high pressure, and high visibility industries such as Healthcare and Cybersecurity. Not only are professionals in these industries expected to function at their highest capacity on a continual, ongoing basis, with minimal resources, budgets, and tools, but they are also mission critical where small mistakes can have a massive detrimental impact. It is time to move into a work well mindset by focusing on internal mental health and well-being in leadership so that leaders can lead from within and serve their organizations and their people well. By looking at our workforce as a comradery of human beings, it is crucial to understand the five essential parts that make up workforce well-being and the phenomenon of the whole person coming to work. 
Do Warning Message Design Recommendations Address Why Non-Experts Do Not Protect Themselves from Cybersecurity Threats? A Review. We aimed to understand whether warning message design recommendations address the reasons why non-experts choose to not protect themselves from cybersecurity threats. Toward that end, we synthesized literature to investigate why non-experts choose to not protect themselves, and catalog design recommendations aimed at influencing how non-experts think about threats. We then evaluated whether those recommendations addressed non-experts’ reasons. We are the first to synthesize and compare these important literatures. Our results revealed that current recommendations do not adequately address many of non-experts’ reasons for not protecting themselves. Therefore, implementing those recommendations probably will not convince those non-experts to protect themselves, which may partially explain why warning messages that implement current recommendations improve user compliance but to levels that are still lower than desired. Our results also highlight the need for future research that could lead to new warning message design recommendations that better address non-experts’ reasons for not protecting themselves. 
The challenges of integrating industry 4.0 in cyber security — a perspective. We adopt Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and professional qualifications for adapting models of deliveries of teaching the module of Cyber Security at the University of Lincoln (UK). To achieve this, we investigate I4.0, the challenges it sets to higher education, and professional qualifications. Our findings are used to devise three models of delivery, namely Comprehensive, Partial and Merged. Our discussions show that our strategy of the integration of I4.0 within the curriculum development effectively prepares students to stand out from the crowd by possessing industry ready accreditations along their computer science degrees and the skills required for their future career in cyber security.

What we think we know about cybersecurity: an investigation of the relationship between perceived knowledge, internet trust, and protection motivation in a cybercrime context. Individual internet users are commonly considered the weakest links in the cybersecurity chain. One reason for this is that they tend to be overoptimistic regarding their own online safety. To gain a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in this assessment, the current study applies an extended version of the protection motivation theory. More specifically, this study includes perceived knowledge and internet trust to discover how these antecedents influence the threat and coping appraisal processes. Based on representative survey data collected from 967 respondents, we found that people who feel well-informed about online safety feel less vulnerable to cybercrime and are less inclined to take security measures. At the same time, feeling informed is associated with being more convinced of the severity of cybercrime. High levels of trust in the safety of the internet are linked to the feeling that one is less vulnerable to cybercrime and the perception that cybercrime is not a severe threat. Future interventions should remind internet users about their own perceived vulnerability and the risks that exist online while ensuring that internet users do not lose their trust in the internet and confidence in their own online knowledge. cybercrime. internet trust. optimism bias. perceived knowledge.

Cybersecurity Awareness Level: The Case of Saudi Arabia University Students. Cybersecurity plays an important role in reliance on digital equipment and programs to manage daily lives chores including the transmission and storage of personal information. Therefore, it is a global issue in our growing society, and it becomes increasingly important to measure and analyze the awareness of it. In this paper, a questionnaire has been designed to measure the current level of cybersecurity awareness (CSA) among Saudi university students. Cybersecurity students’ awareness level questionnaire has been adapted from few other previous cybersecurity awareness campaigns. In this questionnaire, a total of 136 students have participated in the survey. The questionnaire was collected to measure the cybersecurity students’ awareness level through their knowledge, culture, and surrounding environment or through students’ behavior by thee affected factors. These are: gender, location, and study department of the students. The study findings reveal that the students’ awareness is in an average has no significant difference in cybersecurity awareness level between male and female students, but females show a bit more concern about cybersecurity. However, there is a clear and high awareness of students of computer and information technology departments compared to others. Moreover, urban students outperformed students in remote areas in awareness of cybersecurity. The survey results indicate that the study model has been effective in measuring students’ awareness.

Cyber security and privacy issues in industrial internet of things. The emergence of industry 4.0 stems from research that has received a great deal of attention in the last few decades. Consequently, there has been a huge paradigm shift in the manufacturing and production sectors. However, this poses a challenge for cybersecurity and highlights the need to address the possible threats targeting (various pillars of) industry 4.0. However, before providing a concrete solution certain aspect need to be researched, for instance, cybersecurity threats and privacy issues in the industry. To fill this gap, this paper discusses potential solutions to cybersecurity targeting this industry and highlights the consequences of possible attacks and countermeasures (in detail). In particular, the focus of the paper is on investigating the possible cyber-attacks targeting 4 layers of IIoT that is one of the key pillars of Industry 4.0. Based on a detailed review of existing literature, in this study, we have identified possible cyber threats, their consequences, and countermeasures. Further, we have provided a comprehensive framework based on an analysis of cybersecurity and privacy challenges. The suggested framework provides for a deeper understanding of the current state of cybersecurity and sets out directions for future research and applications. Cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity.

The human factor: assessing individuals’ perceptions related to cybersecurity. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reveal and describe the divergent viewpoints about cybersecurity within a purposefully selected group of people with a range of expertise in relation to computer security. Design/methodology/approach: Q methodology [Q] uses empirical evidence to differentiate subjective views and, therefore, behaviors in relation to any topic. Q uses the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research methods to reveal and describe the multiple, divergent viewpoints that exist within a group where individuals sort statements into a grid to represent their views. Analyses group similar views (sorts). In this study, participants were selected from a range of types related to cybersecurity (experts, authorities and uninformed). Findings: Four unique viewpoints emerged such that one represents cybersecurity best practices and the remaining three viewpoints represent poor cybersecurity behaviors (Naïve Cybersecurity Practitioners, Worried but not Vigilant and How is Cybersecurity a Big Problem) that indicate a need for educational interventions within both the public and private sectors. Practical implications: Understanding the divergent views about cybersecurity is important within smaller groups including classrooms, technology-based college majors, a company, a set of IT professionals or other targeted groups where understanding cybersecurity viewpoints can reveal the need for training, changes in behavior and/or the potential for security breaches which reflect the human factors of cybersecurity. Originality/value: A review of the literature revealed that only large, nation-wide surveys have been used to investigate views of cybersecurity. Yet, surveys are not useful in small groups, whereas Q is designed to investigate behavior through revealing subjectivity within smaller groups. Assessments. Cybersecurity. Education. Mixed methods.

Impact of covid-19 pandemic: A cybersecurity perspective. Inspite of the world being at a complete standstill in the wake of unpre-cedented health emergency of COVID-19 pandemic, people have managed to retain their digital interactions through Information Technology. Cloud networks, departmental servers, data centres, and the digital devices have ensured that businesses and industries as well as workers across the world remain associated with each other and are connected to the organizations’ data. In such a scenario, the requirements placed on digital frames have increased rapidly. While this has proved to be a boon in the combat against the spread of Coronavirus, alarming increase in the instances of cyber attacks has become a major bane today. To pre-vent an emergence of second crisis, cybersecurity needs to be upgraded to protect the data of the users and contain the rising cyber crimes. This upgradation will be done when the impact of COVID-19 on security will be estimated. Hence this research is an attempt to gauge and analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cybersecurity. Various aspects of cybersecurity that have been affected by the pandemic have then been ranked in the descending order of severity quantita-tively by the help of multi-criteria decision-making problem solving technique. Such a thorough and conclusive analysis will add to the experts’ efforts in esti-mating the extent of the effects of COVID-19 on cybersecurity. The findings of this study will be an effective reference for designing, developing and implementing more secure mechanisms to protect the users from cyber invasions. Cyber security.

Cyber Security Framework for Vehicular Network Based on a Hierarchical Game. The growth of electronic devices in connected vehicles and their connections to the untrusted network, present unprecedented exposure to attacks. Therefore, a reliable and efficient cyber security framework is mandatory to protect vehicular networks against the cyber attackers. Thereby, we propose a cyber defense framework based on a hierarchical cooperative game to secure legitimate vehicles from attacks. In the proposed hierarchical game, there are two kinds of players, the head agent and secondary agents that cooperate between each other to detect, predict and react efficiently against suspected attacks. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prediction System (IPS), and Intrusion Reaction System (IRS) represent the secondary players, where their strategies are to carry out the detection, prediction and reaction actions, respectively. The Intrusion Decision Agent (IDA) is the head player and is responsible for making decisions in launching the strategies of IDS, IPS and IRS players. The secondary and head agents are to collaborate in order to decrease the false positive and false negative rates, while minimizing the processing delay and overhead. Numerical results show that, our cyber defense game requires low communications overhead and low delay to achieve low false positive and false negative rates as compared to the current intrusion detection and prediction frameworks. cyber security framework. delay. hierarchical game model. overhead.

Cyber Security of Market-based Congestion Management Methods in Power Distribution Systems. As the penetration rate of flexible loads and Distributed Energy Resources in the distribution networks increases, congestion management techniques that utilize Demand Side Management (DSM) have been developed. These are indirect methods that rely on information exchange between the Distribution Network Operator, aggregators, and consumers' meters to encourage customers to change their demand to relieve congestion. Cyber attacks against aggregators can compromise the operation of DSM-based congestion management methods, and hence, affect the security and reliability of electrical networks. In this paper, the vulnerability of indirect congestion management methods to Load Altering Attacks is studied. An optimization algorithm is developed to determine the aggregators a cyber attacker would compromise, via minimum alteration of their load profiles, to cause congestion problems. The impact of such attacks on congestion and consumers' electricity bill is then studied. A mitigation scheme is formulated to determine the most critical aggregators in the network. The security of these aggregators is then reinforced to mitigate such cyber attacks. IEEE. Congestion Management. Cyber security. Cyberattack. Distribution networks. Informatics.

Assessing the influential factors of cybersecurity awareness in Malaysia during the pandemic outbreak: A structural equation modeling. The advanced growth of communication technology today greatly has brought benefits in many ways, but it has indirectly led to the exposure of data privacy and safety of end users to the outsiders. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all citizens are required to stay at home and most of their times have been used on the internet for their leisure, study and work purposes. The massive use of internet lead to cybercriminal like scam, fraud, hacking and cyber bullying. It has been reported that the senior adult is the most affected group. Using the Information Security Awareness Model (ISACM) and the Situation Awareness Cybersecurity Education Model (SAOCE), this study aims to develop a cybersecurity awareness model that can assist the elderly from attacks in cyberspace. Methodologically, this paper is quantitative in nature and recruits 300 senior adults from age 50 until above 60 years via convenience sampling technique. We identified three factors namely organization, social and individual influencing cybersecurity awareness. The result revealed that organization factors significantly related to cybersecurity awareness with value of β=0.151, p=0.025, meanwhile for social and individual factors are found less significant to cybersecurity awareness with values β=-0.066, p=0.328 and β=0.045, p=0.463 respectively. With the development of cybersecurity awareness model, we are confident that our model can contribute to the body of knowledge within the cybersecurity context. Covid-19. Cybersecurity awareness.

Encouraging Employee Engagement With Cybersecurity: How to Tackle Cyber Fatigue. Cybersecurity fatigue is a form of work disengagement specific to cybersecurity. It manifests as a weariness or aversion to cybersecurity-related workplace behaviors or advice and occurs as a result of prior overexposure to cybersecurity-related work demands or training. While some previous theoretical conceptualizations of cybersecurity fatigue are available, this article is the first to capture all dimensions of the phenomenon in a four-component model. The model holds that cybersecurity fatigue can result from overexposure to workplace cybersecurity advice (e.g., training) or cybersecurity actions (e.g., forced password updates). Similarly, we argue that there can be two types of cybersecurity fatigue: attitudinal (e.g., a belief that cybersecurity is not important) and cognitive (e.g., habituated bad behaviors). We present a multidisciplinary review, which draws on research from management, psychology, and information systems. Practitioners can use the four-component model to identify the type of cybersecurity fatigue that may be occurring in employees and adapt workplace processes accordingly to improve behavior. In addition, we present three illustrative case studies, adapted from employee experiences, to demonstrate the application of the four-component model to an organizational context. The review presents a framework for coordinating the existing approaches to cybersecurity fatigue in the current literature. cyber security. disengagement. fatigue. human aspects. information security. 
Attribution and Knowledge Creation Assemblages in Cybersecurity Politics. Attribution is central to cybersecurity politics. It establishes a link between technical occurrences and political consequences by reducing the uncertainty about who is behind an intrusion and what the likely intent was, ultimately creating cybersecurity truthswith political consequences. In a critical security studies' spirit, we purport that the truthabout cyber-incidents that is established through attribution is constructed through a knowledge creation process that is neither value-free nor purely objective but built on assumptions and choices that make certain outcomes more or less likely. We conceptualize attribution as a knowledge creation process in three phases - incident creation, incident response, and public attribution - and embark on identifying who creates what kind of knowledge in this process, when they do it, and on what kind of assumptions and previous knowledge this is based on. Using assemblage theory as a backdrop, we highlight attribution as happening in complex networks that are never stable but always shifting, assembled, disassembled and reassembled in different contexts, with multiple functionalities. To illustrate, we use the intrusions at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) discovered in 2014 and 2015 with a focus on three factors: assumptions about threat actors, entanglement of public and private knowledge creation, and self-reflection about uncertainties. When it comes to attribution as knowledge creation processes, we critique the strong focus on existing enemy images as potentially crowding out knowledge on other threat actors, which in turn shapes the knowledge structure about security in cyberspace. One remedy, so we argue, is to bring in additional data collectors from the academic sector who can provide alternative interpretations based on independent knowledge creation processes. assemblage.

Towards Cybersecurity of the Smart Grid using Digital Twins. The proliferation of cyber-physical systems is bringing with it the growing need to link these systems with virtual environments. Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and especially the imminent need to not be able to manipulate these devices in production environments make necessary mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these physical objects in virtual environments. this has been called a digital twin. On the other hand, cyberattacks are growing in all cyber-physical systems, and in the smart grid, cybersecurity is essential due to the smart grid is a critical infrastructure. This work shows a small implementation of a digital twin system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of digital twins is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid in particularly in cybersecurity testing IEEE. 
An Exploratory Study of the Effects of Knowledge Sharing Methods on Cyber Security Practice. In a networked global economy, cyber security threats have accelerated at an enormous rate. The security infrastructure at organisational and national levels are often ineffective against these threats. As a result, academics have focused their research on information security risksand technical perspectives to enhance human-related security measures. To further extend this trend of research, this study examines the effects of three knowledge sharing methods on user security practices: security training, social media communication, and local security experts (non-IT staff). The study adopts a phenomenological method employing in-depth focus group interviews with 30 participants from eight organisations located in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The study expands on understanding factors contributing to self-efficacy and security practice through various knowledge sharing channels. Current methods of periodical training and broadcast emails were found to be less effective in encouraging participants to develop security self-efficacy and were often ignored. Security knowledge sharing through social media and local experts were identified as supplementary methods in maintaining employees’ security awareness. In particular, social media is suggested as a preferred channel for disseminating urgent security alerts and seeking peer advice. Local security experts are praised for providing timely and contextualised security advice where member trust is needed. This study suggests that provisions of contemporary channels for security information and knowledge sharing between organisations and employees can gain regular attention from employees, hence leading to more effective security practices. cyber security. knowledge sharing. security compliance. social media.

The contested meanings of cybersecurity: evidence from post-conflict Colombia. Cybersecurity is a contested concept. While some definitions focus on technical aspects, other insist on the strategic and geopolitical dimensions. Recently, the definition has included development-related aspects in an increasingly digitalised economy. Instead of cybersecurity, international organisations such as the OECD and private companies now focus on the management of digital risk. While this shift represents an opportunity to include new actors and issues on the political agenda, it does not lead to the de-securitisation of cyberspace, nor to the promotion of cyber peace. This article explores the debates around the definition of cybersecurity with a particular focus on how Colombia became one of the first states to follow the 2015 OECD guidelines on the management of digital risk as part of an effort to join the organisation. It describes how the resulting perspective on cybersecurity evidences a market-centred approach focusing on the development of a digital economy. However, it also discusses why the evolution of cybersecurity policies in Colombia represents a missed opportunity to design a cyber peacebuilding policy in a post-conflict context.

Cyber-Attack Detection and Cyber-Security Enhancement in Smart DC-Microgrid Based on Blockchain Technology and Hilbert Huang Transform. Due to the simultaneous development of DC-microgrids (DC-MGs) and the use of intelligent control, monitoring and operation methods, as well as their structure, these networks can be threatened by various cyber-attacks. Overall, a typical smart DC-MG includes battery, supercapacitors and power electronic devices, fuel cell, solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems, and loads such as smart homes, plug-in hybrid electrical vehicle (PHEV), smart sensors and network communication like fiber cable or wireless to send and receive data. Given these issues, cyber-attack detection and securing data exchanged in smart DC-MGs like CPS has been considered by experts as a significant subject in recent years. In this study, in order to detect false data injection attacks (FDIAs) in a MG system, Hilbert-Huang transform methodology along with blockchain-based ledger technology is used for enhancing the security in the smart DC-MGs with analyzing the voltage and current signals in smart sensors and controllers by extracting the signal details. Results of simulation on the different cases are considered with the objective of verifying the efficacy of the proposed model. The results offer that the suggested model can provide a more precise and robust detection mechanism against FDIA and improve the security of data exchanging in a smart DC-MG. blockchain. data exchanging. false data injection attack.

Cybersecurity Talents Intelligent Evaluation Based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model [基于贝叶斯知识追踪的网安人才能力智能化评估方法]. In recent years, the situation of cyberspace security is becoming more and more serious, which leads to a huge gap of cybersecurity talents. And our country has an increasingly strong demand for cybersecurity talents. To solve the accuracy in cybersecurity talents evaluation, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian knowledge tracking CT-BKT (Cybersecurity Talents Bayesian Knowledge Tracing) model. By tracking the knowledge status of cybersecurity talents, the individualized questions can be intelligently generated, so that dynamic and accurate evaluation of their capabilities can be achieved according to their answering to selected questions. In order to verify the effectiveness of CT-BKT model, here Web security is taken as an example. We sort out the knowledge and skills of Web security and construct the corresponding question bank, and finally implements a Cybersecurity Talents Intelligent Evaluation system (CTIES) in the Web security field. Through the evaluation of 22 cybersecurity talents, CT-BKT knowledge tracking model proposed in this paper has a high prediction accuracy. Besides, CTIES system can give the more detailed and direct display of cybersecurity talents' knowledge mastery of Web security and corresponding professional skill level. The experiment verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of cybersecurity talents evaluation proposed in this paper. Bayesian network. Cybersecurity talents. Intelligent evaluation.

The Dynamics of Business, Cybersecurity and Cyber-Victimization: Foregrounding the Internal Guardian in Prevention. Private organizations suffer great losses due to cybersecurity incidents, and they invest increasing resources to prevent attacks, but little is known about the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures for prevention. Based on the framework of Routine Activity Theory, this paper analyzes the impact of companies’ online activities and cybersecurity measures on victimization. Our analysis of the UK Cybersecurity Breaches Survey shows that the most promising ways to minimize cyber-attacks and their impacts is to invest in in-house cybersecurity human resources and enhance the employees’ online self-protection by providing cybersecurity training, rather than just basic software protection and guidance about strong passwords. cyber fraud. cybercrime. cybersecurity.

Impact of Articulation Agreements on Student Transfer between Higher Education Institutions: A Case Study of a Cybersecurity Program. Cybersecurity education has grown exponentially over the past decade. This growth occurred at all levels of education–from high schools to community colleges to four-year universities. At the same time, renewed interest in helping students transfer between higher education institutions has resulted in calls from policy makers and higher education leaders to create seamless pathways for students. Aligning cybersecurity education with changes in the transfer landscape, a case study was conducted to provide a framework for understanding how to improve services to cybersecurity transfer students. The case study involved four components: a review of articulation agreement literature, a review of processes used in the authors’ home institutions, a review of our experiences with the cybersecurity articulation agreement process, and recommendations for future articulation agreements. 
Defining Cyber Security and Cyber Security Risk within a Multidisciplinary Context using Expert Elicitation. It is important to have and use standardized terminology and develop a comprehensive common understanding of what is meant by cyber security and cyber security risk given the multidisciplinary nature of cyber security and the pervasiveness of cyber security concerns throughout society. Using expert elicitation methods, collaborating cyber researchers from multiple disciplines and two sectors (academia, government–military) were individually interviewed and asked to define cyber security and cyber security risk. Data-driven thematic analysis was used to identify the most salient themes within each definition, sector, and cyber expert group as a whole with results compared to current standards definitions. Network analysis was employed to visualize the interconnection of salient themes within and across sectors and disciplines. When examined as a whole group, context-driven, resilient system functionality, and maintenance of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) were the most salient themes and influential network nodes for the definition of cyber security, while impacts of CIA vulnerabilities, probabilities of outcomes, and context-driven were the most salient themes for cyber security risk. We used this expert elicitation process to develop comprehensive definitions of cyber security (cybersecurity) and cyber security risk that encompass the contextual frameworks of all the disciplines represented in the collaboration and explicitly incorporates human factors as significant cyber security risk factors.

Exploratory data analysis for cybersecurity. Purpose: The impact of cyberattacks all over the world has been increasing at a constant rate every year. Performing exploratory analysis helps organizations to identify, manage and safeguard the information that could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It encourages to the creation of a plan for security controls that can help to protect data and keep constant tabs on threats and monitor their organization’s networks for any breaches. Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of this experimental study is to state the use of data science in analyzing data and to provide a more detailed view of the most common cybersecurity attacks, what are the most accessed logical ports, visible patterns, as well as the trends and occurrence of attacks. The data to be processed has been obtained by aggregating data provided by a company’s technology department, which includes network flow data produced by nine different types of attacks within every day user activities. This could be insightful for many companies to measure the damage caused by these breaches but also gives a foundation for future comparisons and serves as a basis for proactive measures within industry and organizations. Findings: The most common cybersecurity attacks, most accessed logical ports and their visible patterns were found in the acquired data set. The strategies, which attackers have used with respect to time, type of attacks, specific ports, IP addresses and their relationships have been determined. The statistical hypothesis was also performed to check whether attackers were confined to perform random attacks or to any specific machines with some pattern. Originality/value: Policies can be suggested such that if an attack is conducted on a specific machine, which can be prevented by identifying the machine, ports and duration of the attacks on which the attacker is targeting and to formulate such policies that the organization should follow to tackle these targeted attacks in the future.

Optimization-Time Analysis for Cybersecurity. A mathematical framework to reason about time resilience in cybersecurity is introduced. We first consider an attacker who can mount several multi-stage attacks on the organization: the defender's objective is to select an optimal portfolio of security controls, within a given budget, to withstand the highest number of attacks. The mathematical model is a Markov chain with an initial state called the safe state, intermediate states for all possible attacks (each attack state denoting a probabilistic attack graph), and a sink state denoting a successful attack. The overall defence problem is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective optimization, i.e. the defender selects an optimal portfolio of security controls to mitigate an optimal attacker. To determine the probability of success of an attack two cases will be considered: (a)the expected probability of success. (b)the highest probability of success. We refer to these two cases as expected-time analysis and worst-case time analysis. To solve precisely these bi-level optimizations strong duality and Mixed Integer Linear Programming are used. We then extend the framework to investigate resilience in terms of the total duration of the attacks. variations of the previous optimizations are presented to this purpose. Numerical evaluations are provided to compare the results obtained from the expected-time analysis and the worst-case time analysis. IEEE. Analytical models. Cyber-security. Markov processes.

The challenges of software cybersecurity certification. In 2019, the new European Union (EU) cybersecurity regulation Cybersecurity Act(CSA)1 entered into force to create a common framework for the certification of any information and communication technology (ICT) system, including products, services, and processes. The main purpose of this framework is to reduce the current fragmentation of cybersecurity certification schemes2 as well as to increase end users? trust in a hyperconnected society3 by fostering a mutual recognition of certified ICT components in any EU country. 
The nudge puzzle: Matching nudge interventions to cybersecurity decisions. Nudging is a promising approach, in terms of influencing people to make advisable choices in a range of domains, including cybersecurity. However, the processes underlying the concept and the nudge's effectiveness in different contexts, and in the long term, are still poorly understood. Our research thus first reviewed the nudge concept and differentiated it from other interventions before applying it to the cybersecurity area. We then carried out an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of three different nudge-related interventions on four types of cybersecurity-specific decisions. Our study demonstrated that the combination of a simple nudge and information provision, termed a hybrid nudge, was at least as, and in some decision contexts even more effective in encouraging secure choices as the simple nudge on its own. This indicates that the inclusion of information when deploying a nudge, thereby increasing the intervention's transparency, does not necessarily diminish its effectiveness. A follow-up study explored the educational and long-term impact of our tested nudge interventions to encourage secure choices. The results indicate that the impact of the initial nudges, of all kinds, did not endure. We conclude by discussing our findings and their implications for research and practice. Decision making.

Characteristic insights on industrial cyber security and popular defense mechanisms. Due to the deep integration of information technology and operational technology, networked control systems are experiencing an increasing risk of international cyber attacks. In practice, industrial cyber security is a significant topic because current networked control systems are supporting various critical infrastructures to offer vital utility services. By comparing with traditional IT systems, this paper first analyzes the uncontrollable cyber threats and classified attack characteristics, and elaborates the intrinsic vulnerabilities in current networked control systems and novel security challenges in future Industrial Internet. After that, in order to overcome partial vulnerabilities, this paper presents a few representative security mechanisms which have been successfully applied in today's industrial control systems, and these mechanisms originally improve traditional IT defense technologies from the perspective of industrial availability. Finally, several popular security viewpoints, adequately covering the needs of industrial network structures and service characteristics, are proposed to combine with burgeoning industrial information technologies. We target to provide some helpful security guidelines for both academia and industry, and hope that our insights can further promote in-depth development of industrial cyber security. industrial characteristics. industrial cyber threats. security mechanisms and viewpoints. vulnerabilities. 
Increasing cyber security by energy efficient implementation of des algorithms on FPGA. Encryption algorithms are important in ensuring security in cyber physical systems. Some researches validate that security process has a substantial effect on the battery lifespan of a device and FPGAs extend a novel resolution for augmenting the functioning of applications in the meantime the DES algorithm offers means to secure data transmission. In this manuscript, we have analyzed the power consumption of the DES algorithm for 4 different FPGAs and 7 different IO Standards to determine the least power consuming architecture. We have used Xilinx Vivado 2018.2 ISE for all the observations done in this work. Here, Artix-7 FPGA consumes least total on chip power: 1.201W and 27.316W at output loads of 0pF and 500pF respectively. Out of 7 IO Standards analyzed, SSTL15 IO Standard has the least power consumption which varies from 1.2W to 11.025W for 0pF to 10000pF output load respectively. We are saving approx. 59.878W in comparison to previous research works. Here we have used 28nm FPGA, 20nm and 16nm FPGA can also be used. For further reducing the power consumption, different Green Computing techniques like frequency scaling, thermal scaling, clock gating etc can be applied. We may also implement our work on 3-D IC and 4-D IC. DES algorithm. Energy Effficient Cryptographic Algorithm. FPGA. IO Standards. Power consumption. 
Optimal investment in cyber-security under cyber insurance for a multi-branch firm. Investments in security and cyber-insurance are two cyber-risk management strategies that can be employed together to optimize the overall security expense. In this paper, we provide a closed form for the optimal investment under a full set of insurance liability scenarios (full liability, limited liability, and limited liability with deductibles) when we consider a multi-branch firm with correlated vulnerability. The insurance component results to be the major expense. It ends up being the only recommended approach (i.e., setting zero investments in security) when the intrinsic vulnerability is either very low or very high. We also study the robustness of the investment choices when our knowledge of vulnerability and correlation is uncertain, concluding that the uncertainty induced on investment by either uncertain correlation or uncertain vulnerability is not significant.

Measuring the level of cyber-security awareness for cybercrime in Saudi Arabia. The revolution in the Information Technology (IT) field has led to a significant increase in the number of people connected to and utilizing the Internet. However, it has also introduced severe security risks: valuable information such as passwords, financial accounts, and other confidential data are considered attractive targets for attackers. Cyber-attacks against this infrastructure can not only lead to data leakage but can also have significant financial implications and even lead to loss of life. Consequently, to defend against such attacks, and considering that humans have a key role in these technologies, it is important to increase cyber-security awareness. This paper focuses on measuring the current level of cyber-security awareness in Saudi Arabia, in terms of cyber-security practices, level of awareness, and incident reporting, by means of an online questionnaire with 1230 participants. The questionnaire results showed that 31.7% used public Wi-Fi to access the Internet, 51% used their personal information to create their passwords, 32.5% did not have any idea about phishing attacks, 21.7% had been victim of cybercrimes while only 29.2% of them reported the crime, which reflects their levels of awareness. The paper concludes by offering recommendations based on analysis of the results to promote the level of awareness. Cybersecurity. Cybercrime. Threat. Saudi Arabia. Awareness. Malware . Awareness.

Social engineering in cybersecurity: Effect mechanisms, human vulnerabilities and attack methods. Social engineering attacks have posed a serious security threat to cyberspace. However, there is much we have yet to know regarding what and how lead to the success of social engineering attacks. This paper proposes a conceptual model which provides an integrative and structural perspective to describe how social engineering attacks work. Three core entities (effect mechanism, human vulnerability and attack method) are identified to help the understanding of how social engineering attacks take effect. Then, beyond the familiar scope, we analyze and discuss the effect mechanisms involving 6 aspects (persuasion, social influence, cognition attitude behavior, trust and deception, language thought decision, emotion and decision-making) and the human vulnerabilities involving 6 aspects (cognition and knowledge, behavior and habit, emotions and feelings, human nature, personality traits, individual characters), respectively. Finally, 16 social engineering attack scenarios (including 13 attack methods) are presented to illustrate how these mechanisms, vulnerabilities and attack methods are used to explain the success of social engineering attacks. Besides, this paper offers lots of materials for security awareness training and future empirical research, and the model is also helpful to develop a domain ontology of social engineering in cybersecurity. attack model. attack scenario. education awareness and training. human hacking. principle. psychology cognition and behavior. security.

A Cyber-Security Methodology for a Cyber-Physical Industrial Control System Testbed. Due to recent increase in deployment of Cyber-Physical Industrial Control Systems in different critical infrastructures, addressing cyber-security challenges of these systems is vital for assuring their reliability and secure operation in presence of malicious cyber attacks. Towards this end, developing a testbed to generate real-time data-sets for critical infrastructure that would be utilized for validation of real-time attack detection algorithms are indeed highly needed. This paper investigates and proposes the design and implementation of a cyber-physical industrial control system testbed where the Tennessee Eastman process is simulated in real-time on a PC and the closed-loop controllers are implemented on the Siemens PLCs. False data injection cyber attacks are injected to the developed testbed through the man-in-the-middle structure where the malicious hackers can in real-time modify the sensor measurements that are sent to the PLCs. Furthermore, various cyber attack detection algorithms are developed and implemented in real-time on the testbed and their performance and capabilities are compared and evaluated. attack detection algorithm. cyber attack. hybrid testbed.

Cy-Through: Toward a Cybersecurity Simulation for Supporting Live, Virtual, and Constructive Interoperability. Cybersecurity simulation is a useful, practical approach to provide insights to counter cyber threats for organizations with a large-scale, complex cyber environment. From the micro behavior of malware on a host to the macroscopic impact of a DDoS attack, various phenomena can be observed and analyzed with simulation scenarios. Many platforms for cybersecurity simulation have been developed to support simulation scenarios and models with different fidelity levels: live, virtual, and constructive. Many platforms for cybersecurity simulation have been developed to support simulation scenarios and models with varying fidelity levels: live, virtual, and constructive. Hence, the support of interoperability between models with different fidelities remained untrodden in the cybersecurity simulation literature. In this paper, we propose a novel cybersecurity simulation platform, Cy-Through, which enables full interoperability between models with different fidelity levels, live/virtual and constructive models. Through the development and demonstration of a prototype of the platform, we prove the possibility of a Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC)-interoperable cybersecurity simulation.

Keep the dark web close and your cyber security tighter. The dark web still offers a safe haven for criminal activity – especially those sites operating outside the reach of Western law enforcement. Much of the dark web is devoted to cybercrime, from sharing techniques and tools to selling stolen data and credentials. Having an ear to the ground in this shadowy underworld can give organisations an edge in identifying and defending against threats, from new trends to attacks specifically targeting them. But acquiring access to these secrets is no easy feat, explains Ziv Mador of Trustwave. The golden age of the dark web marketplace is over. So declared Europol in September 2020, after the triumphant announcement of operation ‘DisrupTOR’, a sting that led to the arrest of 179 criminals selling drugs and weapons.1 The operation, which saw co-ordination between Europol and law agencies across the world, is the latest strike against the virtual marketplaces that are the beating heart of the criminal underworld today. 
Cybersecurity of Wide Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control Systems for HVDC Applications. The flexibility provided by High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems can be further extended by Wide Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control (WAMAPC) systems. WAMPAC systems enable many HVDC applications and, on the other hand, inevitably introduce cybersecurity concerns that need to be addressed. In this work, a security domain layer and decision framework is reported to detect and mitigate the impact of false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting HVDC stations. Specifically, a rule-based cyber-attack detection method is introduced and implemented on Raspberry Pi and tested on the real-time HVDC simulation facility on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) platform at ABB U.S. Corporate Research Center.

Psychological defence and cyber security: Two integral parts of estonia's comprehensive approach for countering hybrid threats. Disruptive developments in the field of information and communication technology have enabled malicious actors to turn elements of the digital ecosystem into information weapons in hybrid conflict. Estonia has tackled the new security realm with comprehensive national defence that is built upon understanding that the society itself is object of security and should provide appropriate safeguards and responses. Estonian conceptualisations of national cybersecurity, psychological defence, and strategic communications are elaborated in the light of actual seminal threat situations. Analysis of evolvement of the strategic documents guides the recommendations for even deeper blend of the technical cybersecurity culture with value-centric psychological defence and internationalisation of information security situational awareness and planning.

Cybersecurity in Brain-Computer Interfaces: RFID-based design-theoretical framework. Brain Computer Interface BCI is a real-time communication system that connects the brain and external devices. The BCI system can directly convert the information sent by the brain into commands that can drive external devices and replace human limbs or language organs to achieve hu-man communication with the outside world and the external environment Control. In other words, the BCI system can replace the normal peripheral nerve and muscle tissue to achieve communication between the human and the computer or between the human and the external environment. The objective of this paper is to assist the network security for the BCI applications to identify brain activities in a secure real-time mode. To achieve this, we proposed the design of a Radio Frequency Identification RFID-based system having semi− active RFID tags placed outside the brain on the scalp transmit the collected brain activities wirelessly to a devise SC (Scanner Controller) consist of mini-reader and timer integrated together for every patient. Additionally, the paper implemented a novel system prototype interface called BCI Identification System (BCIIS) to assist the patient in the identification process. Given the benefits of RFID, we believed that if the idea is adopted and implemented by industry, it could enhance and provide secure BCI applications. BCI. Brain-computer interface. Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity policy and the legislative context of the water and wastewater sector in South Africa. The water and wastewater sector is an important lifeline upon which other economic sectors depend. Securing the sector’s critical infrastructure is therefore important for any country’s economy. Like many other nations, South Africa has an overarching national cybersecurity strategy aimed at addressing cyber terrorism, cybercriminal activities, cyber vandalism, and cyber sabotage. The aim of this study is to contextualise the water and wastewater sector’s cybersecurity responsibilities within the national cybersecurity legislative and policy environment. This is achieved by conducting a detailed analysis of the international, national and sector cybersecurity stakeholders. legislation and policies. and challenges pertaining to the protection of the water and wastewater sector. The study found some concerning challenges and improvement gaps regarding the complex manner in which the national government is implementing the cybersecurity strategy. The study also found that, along with the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (the national cybersecurity strategy of South Africa), the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, and other supporting legislation and policies make provision for the water and wastewater sector’s computer security incidents response team to be established without the need to propose any new laws or amend existing ones. This is conducive for the immediate development of the sector-specific cybersecurity governance framework and resilience strategy to protect the water and wastewater assets. Cybercrime.

First broad and systematic horizon scanning campaign and study to detect societal and ethical dilemmas and emerging issues spanning over cybersecurity solutions. Cybersecurity and cybercrime cannot exist without each other. They are not contraries, but rather two opposite poles of the same idea. Although it may seem that it is a rather black and white kind of relationship, the measures aimed at protecting innocent people raise a myriad of ethical dilemmas. This paper presents the results of a horizon scanning study aimed at identifying the ethical and human rights dilemmas that may arise in relation to cybersecurity and cybercrime. in the paper, the identified weak signals have been presented, that is, the ideas or concerns which are less obvious, not widely researched or present in the media. The cybersecurity-related ethical issues arise as part of the relations between the affected people and other entities. thus, in this paper, the identified dilemmas have been organized according to the nature of the relations.

Cyber security solutions for businesses in financial services: Challenges, opportunities, and the way Forward. This paper examines the challenges that small, medium, and large businesses in the financial services industry are facing concerning data security and providing relevant tools and strategies to protect the same. A qualitative research-based approach has been used where one-on-one interviews were conducted with 10 CIOs (chief information officers) and CISOs (chief information security officers). This data was compared with secondary data sources to validate the findings. This paper presents an in-depth analysis regarding security technologies and their efficacy to protect data assets and sensitive information. It will also opine about the technologies that each business type can use economically to cover the gamut of cyber-attacks. Existing research is restricted to either addressing small and medium businesses (SMBs) or large businesses. This paper attempts a comprehensive review for all sizes of businesses. Cyber threats.

Intrusion Detection for Cybersecurity of Smart Meters. The integration of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) enables real-time communication for smart meters to participate in power system operations. However, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI) are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Both utilities and power consumers may become victims of cyber intrusions. In this paper, a two-stage cyber intrusion protection system is proposed. At the first stage of intrusion detection, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a detection algorithm to discover suspicious behaviors inside a smart meter. At the second stage, the Temporal Failure Propagation Graph (TFPG) technique is used to generate attack routes for identifying attack events. Finally, the proposed pattern recognition algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between a detected abnormal event and pre-defined cyber attacks. A higher similarity value implies a higher chance that a smart meter is under attack. An AMI security test platform has been developed to: (1) Collect training/testing data for SVM, (2) Simulate and analyze cyber attack events, and (3) Validate the proposed cyber attack protection system. The test platform consists of Network-Simulator 3 (NS-3) software to simulate an AMI network environment and single board computers (SBCs) to emulate the IEEE 802.15.4 communication between a grid router and a smart meter.

Cybersecurity Threats and Organisational Response: Textual Analysis and Panel Regression. This study examines the relationship between cybersecurity threats faced and cybersecurity response planned by organisations. Classifying cybersecurity threats into four types–physical threats, personnel threats, communication and data threats, and operational threats–this study examines organisational responses to such threats. Using textual data on cybersecurity threats and response gathered from the 10-K reports published by 87 organisations, topic modelling was conducted to assess the threats and response. A cross-sectional time-series regression model fitted on the topic weights showed that cybersecurity response was influenced by cybersecurity threats, beyond the time-invariant control and period variables. Specifically, physical threats and operational threats influenced the technical response. physical threats, communication and data threats, and operational threats influenced the non-technical response. and personnel threats influenced the overall response.

Developing a globally applicable cybersecurity framework for healthcare: A Delphi consensus study. Background Cybersecurity in healthcare has become increasingly important as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of digital technologies in healthcare provision around the world, while simultaneously encouraged cybercriminals to target healthcare organisations in greater numbers. Despite the threat of cyberattack to patient safety and the provision of healthcare, cybersecurity in the health sector lags behind other industries. Additionally, no adequate cybersecurity framework exists which considers the unique needs of the health sector. Methods An online Delphi was carried out to develop a globally relevant and applicable readiness framework to guide cybersecurity planning in healthcare. Experts (n=42) in the areas of cybersecurity, information communications and technology and health informatics were invited to list the components they felt were essential to a framework and subsequently agree with consensus on a final framework based on the identified components. Results After two rounds, the Essentials of Cybersecurity in Healthcare Organizations (ECHO) framework with 51 components, grouped into six categories, was regarded by the experts as an acceptable planning tool to guide cybersecurity in healthcare at the global level. Conclusions The ECHO framework, designed based on components chosen by international experts to meet the challenges of cybersecurity scale-up in the health and care sector globally, can help guide policymakers and health and care organisations in strengthening their cybersecurity infrastructure and deliver safe and effective care. global health. health care facilities, manpower and services. health planning. health services administration. patient care. 
Adversarial active learning for named entity recognition in cybersecurity. Owing to the continuous barrage of cyber threats, there is a massive amount of cyber threat intelligence. However, a great deal of cyber threat intelligence come from textual sources. For analysis of cyber threat intelligence, many security analysts rely on cumbersome and time-consuming manual efforts. Cybersecurity knowledge graph plays a significant role in automatics analysis of cyber threat intelligence. As the foundation for constructing cybersecurity knowledge graph, named entity recognition (NER) is required for identifying critical threat-related elements from textual cyber threat intelligence. Recently, deep neural network-based models have attained very good results in NER. However, the performance of these models relies heavily on the amount of labeled data. Since labeled data in cybersecurity is scarce, in this paper, we propose an adversarial active learning framework to effectively select the informative samples for further annotation. In addition, leveraging the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network, we propose a novel NER model by introducing a dynamic attention mechanism into the BiLSTM-LSTM encoderdecoder. With the selected informative samples annotated, the proposed NER model is retrained. As a result, the performance of the NER model is incrementally enhanced with low labeling cost. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Active learning. Adversarial learning. Dynamic attention mechanism. Named entity recognition.

Blockchain for Cybersecurity in Smart Grid: A Comprehensive Survey. Blockchain is an immutable type of distributed ledger that is capable of storing data without relying on a third party. Blockchain technology has attracted significant interest in research areas, including its application in the smart grid for cybersecurity. Although significant efforts have been devoted to utilizing blockchain in the smart grid for cybersecurity, there is a lack of comprehensive survey on blockchain in the smart grid for cybersecurity in both application and technological perspectives. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive survey on blockchain for smart gird cybersecurity. This conducted survey presents the latest insights of ideas, architectures, and techniques of implementation that are relevant to blockchain's application in the smart grid for cybersecurity. This article aims at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts specific to blockchain for cybersecurity in the smart grid.

Hacking Back: Trump’s Madman Theory Approach to Cybersecurity. With the swift advancement in communication technology, there has been an increase in computer-related attacks targeting both the software and hardware of nations’ computer systems. Historically, the United States has taken a cautious, defensive-oriented approach to deal with its adversaries in cyberspace. The Trump administration strategy is a hyper-aggressive, offense-first approach to deter its enemies from attacking. This shift in tactics, i.e., the Madman Theory approach against one’s adversaries, is a similar posture to that of President Nixon in his administrations’ effort to end the War in Vietnam. Just like Nixon in Vietnam, there is a tradeoff with this approach. As the United States has stepped up its aggressiveness against cyber adversaries, the possibility is now very real for the Trump administration of an all-out war in cyberspace.

Cyber-security of centralized, decentralized, and distributed control-detector architectures for nonlinear processes. Decentralized and distributed control systems provide an efficient solution to many challenges of controlling large-scale industrial processes. With the expansion in communication networks, vulnerability to cyber intrusions also increases. This work investigates the effect of different types of standard cyber-attacks on the operation of nonlinear processes under centralized, decentralized, and distributed model predictive control (MPC) systems. The robustness of the decentralized control architecture over distributed and centralized control architectures is analyzed. Moreover, a machine-learning-based detector is trained using sensor data to monitor the cyber security of the overall system. Specifically, detectors built using feed-forward neural networks are used to detect the presence of an attack or identify the subsystem being attacked. A nonlinear chemical process example is simulated to demonstrate the robustness of decentralized control architectures and the effectiveness of the neural-network detection scheme in maintaining the closed-loop stability of the system.

The cybersecurity workforce and skills. Cyber security is now an essential requirement for modern organisations, but many face a significant constraint in terms of a lack of skilled personnel to support the required roles and responsibilities. Although numerous related qualifications and certifications are available, it is necessary to understand this landscape in order to make an informed decision about which may signify the skills that are relevant to pursue or recruit. This briefing paper examines the nature of the challenge, presenting evidence of the reported skills shortages, and then proceeding to examine the different forms of qualification that are available, and how security practitioners and employers may usefully identify the options that are best suited to their needs.

Integrated framework for cybersecurity auditing. Organizations receive several cyberattacks on their daily operations, thus the need for auditing. However, there is no unified tool to perform cybersecurity audit tasks which are expensive and tedious. In this paper, we build a cybersecurity framework to perform cybersecurity auditing process in organizations. It covers several types of threats and risks by providing the information systems auditors and cybersecurity professionals with several types of controls. Moreover, it illustrates the essential tools and techniques for cybersecurity auditing. The proposed framework clarifies the security issues through output reports. These reports specify the cybersecurity gaps. Also, it helps practitioners to generate an integrated tool to support cybersecurity auditors learning how to secure organizations and finding a mechanism to achieve the cybersecurity audit tasks.

Cybersecurity in ports and maritime industry: Reasons for raising awareness on this issue. The port industry is constantly evolving and this evolution brings about change in many different areas. Some of these areas are: operational and infrastructural capabilities, governance models and administrative frameworks, the introduction of new technologies or alliances and business strategies. Nowadays, one of the main drivers of changes in the ports sector is the digital transformation that smart ports are experiencing. The level of integration of different devices, agents and activities, together with an increasing connectivity between different ports has created a new ecosystem in which new risks have appeared. Cybersecurity is one of the challenges of the industry and policymakers should work alongside the private sector to ensure these critical infrastructures are adequately protected while facilitating the full development of new technologies in a sector that has relatively lagged behind others in transitioning to the new ‘4.0 world’.

Keeping customers' data secure: A cross-cultural study of cybersecurity compliance among the Gen-Mobile workforce. Employees are increasingly relying on mobile devices. In international organizations, more employees are using their personal smartphones for work purposes. Meanwhile, the number of data breaches is rising and affecting the security of customers' data. However, employees' cybersecurity compliance with cybersecurity policies is poorly understood. Researchers have called for a more holistic approach to information security. We propose an employee smartphone-security compliance (ESSC) model, which deepens understanding of employees' information-security behavior by considering influences on the national, organizational, technological (smartphone-specific), and personal levels. The research focuses on secure smartphone use in the workplace among Gen-Mobile (aged 18–35) employees in a cross-cultural context: the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US) and United Arab Emirates (UAE) where 1735 questionnaires were collected. Our findings suggest that those who wish to understand employees' smartphone-security behavior should consider national cybersecurity policies, cultural differences in different countries, and threats specific to smartphone use. In addition, our findings help companies to increase customers’ trust and maintain a positive reputation. Cross-cultural information security. Customer data. Employee cybersecurity compliance.

Strategic leadership in cyber security, case Finland. Cyber security has become one of the biggest priorities for businesses and governments. Streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber security vision is achieved. The strategic leadership of cyber security implies identifying and setting goals based on the protection of the digital operating environment. Furthermore, it implies coordinating actions and preparedness as well as managing extensive disruptions. The aim of this article is to define what is strategic leadership of cyber security and how it is implemented as part of the comprehensive security model in Finland. In terms of effective strategic leadership of cyber security, it is vital to identify structures that can respond to the operative requirements set by the environment. As a basis for national security development and preparedness, it is necessary to have a clear strategy level leadership model for crises management in disturbances in normal and in emergency conditions. In order to ensure cyber security and achieve the set strategic goals, society must be able to engage different parties and reconcile resources and courses of action as efficiently as possible. Cyber capability must be developed in the entire society, which calls for strategic coordination, management and executive capability. Cyber security. national security. strategic leadership. 
Processing tweets for cybersecurity threat awareness. Receiving timely and relevant security information is crucial for maintaining a high-security level on an IT infrastructure. This information can be extracted from Open Source Intelligence published daily by users, security organisations, and researchers. In particular, Twitter has become an information hub for obtaining cutting-edge information about many subjects, including cybersecurity. This work proposes SYNAPSE, a Twitter-based streaming threat monitor that generates a continuously updated summary of the threat landscape related to a monitored infrastructure. SYNAPSE is designed to accurately select any kind of cybersecurity events and summarise them for the convenience of security analysts. Its tweet-processing pipeline is composed of filtering, feature extraction, binary classification, an innovative clustering strategy, and generation of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). A quantitative evaluation considering over 195.000 tweets from 80 accounts over more than 8 months, shows that our approach successfully finds the majority of security-related tweets concerning an example IT infrastructure (true positive rate above 90%), incorrectly selects a small number of tweets as relevant (false positive rate under 10%), and summarises the results in few IoCs per day. A qualitative evaluation of the IoCs generated by SYNAPSE demonstrates their relevance, and timeliness. Finally, we provide some highlights of a real-world integration of SYNAPSE with the Security Operation Center of a nation-wide electric utility. Machine learning. OSINT. Stream clustering.

Cybersecurity Index for Undergraduate Computer Science Courses in the UK. The paper proposes a novel index to classify how well UK Computer Science courses articulate cybersecurity-related content through their course/module pages. The aim of this work is to raise awareness among British Universities to pay more attention to include and standardize cybersecurity content in computer science courses. Our results show that 80% of analyzed courses scored 1 or 2-stars on a 5-Stars scale. The results also suggest the need for a formal delivery of cybersecurity content from the first year of the courses and possibly in a collaborative manner with the British Computer Society (BCS). To emphasize cybersecurity education in mitigating security lapses, the analogy is: it is better if most people know how to use a match than to train many fire-fighters. computer science. cybersecurity education.

Between privacy and security: the factors that drive intentions to use cyber-security applications. Installing security applications is a common way to protect against malicious apps, phishing emails, and other threats in mobile operating systems. While these applications can provide essential security protections, they also tend to access large amounts of people's sensitive information. Therefore, individuals need to evaluate the trade-off between the security features and the privacy invasion when deciding on which protection mechanisms to use. In this paper, we examine factors affecting the willingness to install mobile security applications by taking into account the invasion levels and security features of cyber-security applications. To this end, we propose a visual language that depicts the coverage of different security features as well as privacy intrusiveness levels. Our user study (n=300) shows that users assessing security applications find their trade-off balance in highly secure apps with a medium level of privacy invasion. The results indicate that a low privacy invasion might signal that the security application provides less security. We discuss these findings in the context of understanding the trade-off between privacy and security. cyber-security. mobile security applications. Privacy. user study. visualisation. 
A tale of two cybers - how threat reporting by cybersecurity firms systematically underrepresents threats to civil society. Public and academic knowledge of cyber conflict relies heavily on data from commercial threat reporting. There are reasons to be concerned that these data provide a distorted view of cyber threat activity. Commercial cybersecurity firms only focus on a subset of the universe of threats, and they only report publicly on a subset of the subset. High end threats to high-profile victims are prioritized in commercial reporting while threats to civil society organizations, which lack the resources to pay for high-end cyber defense, tend to be neglected or entirely bracketed. This selection bias not only hampers scholarship on cybersecurity but also has concerning consequences for democracy. We present and analyze an original dataset of available public reporting by the private sector together with independent research centers. We also present three case studies tracing reporting patterns on a cyber operation targeting civil society. Our findings confirm the neglect of civil society threats, supporting the hypothesis that commercial interests of firms will produce a systematic bias in reporting, which functions as much as advertising as intelligence. The result is a truncated sample of cyber conflict that underrepresents civil society targeting and distorts academic debate as well as public policy. civil society. cyber conflict.

A meta-model of cybersecurity curriculums: Assessing cybersecurity curricular frameworks for business schools. Business schools can meet the increasingly multidisciplinary requirements of training cybersecurity professionals. But in developing curriculums, they face different cybersecurity curricular frameworks with diverse emphases. Using a meta-framework consisting of a 2x3 model and a 2x2 model, this study examines ten cybersecurity curricular frameworks and 380 associated topics and areas. It finds that most curricular frameworks examined tend to have more technical topics and are less IS/business-related. Among them, CAE-CDE is the most technically-oriented curricular framework, while CISSP has more topics that are cybersecurity-related and nontechnical. The proposed meta-model can enable business schools to evaluate cybersecurity curricular frameworks based on their own priorities and resources. Computer and information science education.

Cybersecurity of Plug-In Electric Vehicles: Cyberattack Detection during Charging. While large scale deployment of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) offers promising advantages, such as environmental benefits, energy security, and economic stability, it also poses certain cybersecurity related challenges. Unlike power grid security, PEV cybersecurity is significantly underexplored. However, cyberattacks on PEVs may lead to disastrous situations such as out-of-service EVs via denial-of-charging (DoC) or battery pack damage via overcharging. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by exploring control-oriented approaches for PEV cybersecurity. Specifically, we focus on designing algorithms for detecting cyberattacks that can potentially affect PEV battery packs during charging. We discuss two algorithms: first, static detector that utilizes only measured variables, and, second, dynamic detector that utilizes the knowledge of system dynamics along with the measurements. Furthermore, we propose a filter-based design approach for the dynamic detector that considers a multiobjective criterion including stability, robustness, and attack sensitivity. We perform theoretical analysis and simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms under DoC and overcharging attacks that indicate the superiority of dynamic detector in terms of attack detectability.

Managing cybersecurity at the grassroots: Evidence from the first nationwide survey of local government cybersecurity. This paper, based on data from the first nationwide survey of cybersecurity among local or grassroots governments in the United States, examines how these governments manage this important function. As we have shown elsewhere, cybersecurity among local governments is increasingly important because these governments are under constant or nearly constant cyberattack. Due to the frequency of cyberattacks, as well as the probability that at least some attacks will succeed and cause damage to local government information systems, these governments have great responsibility to protect their information assets. This, in turn, requires these governments to manage cybersecurity effectively, something our data show is largely absent at the American grassroots. That is, on average, local governments fail to manage cybersecurity well. After discussing our findings, we conclude and make recommendations for ways of improving local government cybersecurity management. 
Mapping the Known Unknowns of Cybersecurity Education: A Review of Syllabi on Cyber Conflict and Security. Colleges and universities continue to expand their curricula to include cybersecurity as an explicit course of study in political science. But what is taught in a course on cybersecurity? Are syllabi deep dives into technology, broad romps through contemporary policy debates, or do they reflect a more varied disposition? Studying the syllabi of an area of study, especially one as immature at cybersecurity, can reveal a great deal about the assumptions and practices of scholars. This paper reviews two dozen syllabi to identify key literature in the field, generate an overview of best practices on teaching cyber conflict across academic institutions, help identify potential gaps in current course offerings, and assist faculty in identifying core concepts and readings. We found that few courses use the same literature, such that there is tremendous intellectual and disciplinary diversity in course content. Of the top 13 readings across the surveyed syllabi, all but two were published in the last seven years. The state of play in cybersecurity education is to emphasize recent scholarship, largely found outside the top-tier journals in political science and related disciplines. Highlighting these findings, this paper explores some additional materials and resources which can complement a still sparse canon of cybersecurity literature. cyber conflict. cyber war. cybersecurity.

Perceptions of Cybersecurity Readiness among Workgroup IT Managers. Any modern cybersecurity strategy relies upon IT managers who are experts in their field, who are willing to employ best practices, and who educate their users. Large corporations have developed an intrinsic understanding of these factors. However, large corporations are comprised of departmental units that are not always considered in the organization’s cybersecurity profile. This is particularly true at colleges and universities where IT managers who are not affiliated with the central IT department sometimes employ their own security strategies. This article describes a study that surveyed 161 IT managers to determine their perceptions of their cybersecurity readiness. The model described in this study is the Practice and Awareness Cybersecurity Readiness Model (PACRM). The survey instrument was developed and validated, then tested using path analysis. Eleven of twenty-six relationships were found to be significant. This model offers a step forward in understanding top-to-bottom cybersecurity readiness in the modern threat environment.

Cybersecurity investments in a two-echelon supply chain with third-party risk propagation. Cybersecurity presents a monumental challenge for interconnected supply chains, as an attack on one node can compromise an entire business. In this paper, we propose a game theory model to investigate cybersecurity investments with third-party risk propagation in a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one retailer and n suppliers. The optimal investments and their responses to relevant security characteristics, such as intrinsic vulnerability, propagation probability, number of suppliers, and attack probability, are analysed and discussed both theoretically and numerically considering one-stage risk propagation. It is found that there are serious prisoners' dilemma and free-riding phenomena in such a scenario. To mitigate third-party risks and improve the investment efficiency, three coordination mechanisms, joint decision, security risk compensation, and security information sharing, are presented and compared numerically. The results indicate that joint decision-making and security risk compensation perform better on stimulating firms' investments and reducing expected costs both individually and collectively relative to security information sharing. Furthermore, the case of two-stage risk propagation is also supplemented and compared with one-stage case. Based on these findings, some management insights are recommended to cybersecurity managers in supply chains for designing more efficient cybersecurity mechanisms and investment strategies. cybersecurity investment. interdependent security. supply chain coordination. third-party risk propagation. 
Making Digital Territory: Cybersecurity, Techno-nationalism, and the Moral Boundaries of the State. Drawing on an analysis of German national cybersecurity policy, this paper argues that cybersecurity has become a key site in which states mobilize science and technology to produce state power. Contributing to science and technology studies (STS) work on technoscience and statecraft, I develop the concepts of territorialization projects and digital territory to capture how the production of state power in the digital age increasingly relies on technoscientific expertise about information infrastructure, shifting tasks of government into the domain of computer scientists and network engineers. The notion of territorialization projects describes states’ ongoing struggle to mobilize science and engineering in order to transform globally distributed information infrastructure into bounded national territory and invest it with patriotic meaning: making digital territory. Digital territory, in other words, is nationalized information infrastructure: it includes building and monopolizing infrastructure as well as normative ideas about nation—who is a digital citizen, and who isn’t. or what constitutes good and bad digital citizens. Nationalizing information infrastructure and placing statecraft into the hands of scientists and engineers might indicate an emerging form of techno-nationalism—a combination of nationalist and technocratic tendencies—raising urgent questions for STS scholarship to investigate the consequences of territorialization projects for justice, democracy, and civic life. cybersecurity. infrastructure. national identity. statecraft. techno-nationalism. territorialization. 
Big Data Analytics in Cyber Security: Network Traffic and Attacks. Network attacks, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention are important topics in cyber security. Network flows and system events generate big data, which often leads to challenges in intrusion detection with high efficiency and good accuracy. This paper focuses on the ‘Volume’, ‘Veracity’, and ‘Variety’ of big data characteristics in network traffic and attacks. Datasets with various data types including numerical data and categorical data (such as status or flag data) are analyzed with the help of R language and its functions. Data duplicates detection and removal, missing values detection, and data quality analysis are also performed. The analysis of masquerades for various users is conducted. In addition, the correlation analysis of variables and a clustering analysis based on k-means are also performed.

An Adversarial Risk Analysis Framework for Cybersecurity. Risk analysis is an essential methodology for cybersecurity as it allows organizations to deal with cyber threats potentially affecting them, prioritize the defense of their assets, and decide what security controls should be implemented. Many risk analysis methods are present in cybersecurity models, compliance frameworks, and international standards. However, most of them employ risk matrices, which suffer shortcomings that may lead to suboptimal resource allocations. We propose a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity risk analysis, covering the presence of both intentional and nonintentional threats and the use of insurance as part of the security portfolio. A simplified case study illustrates the proposed framework, serving as template for more complex problems.

Knowledge Management for Cybersecurity in Business Organizations: A Case Study. Knowledge management (KM) plays important roles in cybersecurity. This study collects five real-life cases of good practices of KM for the domain of cybersecurity in business organizations. Through an iterative process of team-based qualitative data analysis of the five cases, the study develops a model of KM for cybersecurity that conceptualizes three common aspects of KM practices for cybersecurity in business organizations. First, KM for cybersecurity in business organizations has clear specialized organizational structures that involve three inter-organizational tiers across the organization boundaries. Second, the knowledge flows of KM for cybersecurity in business organizations emphasize on explicit, declarative, and specific knowledge. Third, in comparison with KM for other domains, KM for cybersecurity has well-defined objective measures to assess the effectiveness of KM. The domain-specific KM model based on the good practice cases provides a road-map for KM practices in the domain of cybersecurity in business organizations. case study. cybersecurity in business organizations. induction. joint analytical process.

Cybersecurity Awareness and Skills of Senior Citizens: A Motivation Perspective. Senior citizens are one of the most vulnerable groups of Internet users who are prone to cyberattacks. Thus, assessing senior citizens’ motivation to acquire cybersecurity skills is critical to help them understand the risks of cyber-attacks. This study investigated a set of constructs that contribute to senior citizens’ motivation to acquire cybersecurity skills and assessed the actual cybersecurity skill level of these individuals. Utilizing a Web-based survey and a hands-on scenario-based app called MyCyberSkills™, this research study measured the constructs of interest before and after cybersecurity awareness training. Study participants were 254 senior citizens with a mean age of approximately 70 years. The results indicated that the cybersecurity awareness training was effective in increasing the cybersecurity skill level of the senior citizens and empowered them with small but significant improvements in the requisite skills to take mitigating actions against cyberattacks. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. cyber-attack. Cybersecurity awareness. cybersecurity skills. extrinsic motivation. identity theft. intrinsic motivation. senior citizens. 
Apply transfer learning to cybersecurity: Predicting exploitability of vulnerabilities by description. Thousands of software vulnerabilities are archived and disclosed to the public each year, posing severe cybersecurity threats to the whole society. Predicting the exploitability of vulnerabilities is crucial for decision-makers to prioritize their efforts and patch the most critical vulnerabilities. Software vulnerability descriptions are accessible features in early stage and contain rich semantic information. Therefore, descriptions are wildly used for exploitability prediction in both industry and academia. However, comparing with other corpora, the size of vulnerability description corpus is too small to train a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. To gain a better performance, this paper proposes a framework named ExBERT to accurately predict if a vulnerability will be exploited or not. ExBERT essentially is an improved Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for exploitability prediction. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT using collected domain-specific corpus. Then, we design a Pooling Layer and a Classification Layer on top of the fine-tuned BERT model to extract sentence-level semantic features and predict the exploitability of vulnerabilities. Results on 46,176 real-word vulnerabilities have demonstrated that the proposed ExBERT framework achieves 91.12% on accuracy and 91.82% on precision, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach with 89.0% on accuracy and 81.8% on precision.

Achieving data security and privacy across healthcare applications using cyber security mechanisms. Purpose: Currently, in the health-care sector, information security and privacy are increasingly important issues. The improvement in information security is highlighted in adopting digital patient records based on regulation, providers’ consolidation, and the growing need to exchange information among patients, providers, and payers. Design/methodology/approach: Big data on health care are likely to improve patient outcomes, predict epidemic outbreaks, gain valuable insights, prevent diseases, reduce health-care costs and improve analysis of the quality of life. Findings: In this paper, the big data analytics-based cybersecurity framework has been proposed for security and privacy across health-care applications. It is vital to identify the limitations of existing solutions for future research to ensure a trustworthy big data environment. Furthermore, electronic health records (EHR) could potentially be shared by various users to increase the quality of health-care services. This leads to significant issues of privacy that need to be addressed to implement the EHR. Originality/value: This framework combines several technical mechanisms and environmental controls and is shown to be enough to adequately pay attention to common threats to network security.

Sifu - a cybersecurity awareness platform with challenge assessment and intelligent coach. Software vulnerabilities, when actively exploited by malicious parties, can lead to catastrophic consequences. Proper handling of software vulnerabilities is essential in the industrial context, particularly when the software is deployed in critical infrastructures. Therefore, several industrial standards mandate secure coding guidelines and industrial software developers’ training, as software quality is a significant contributor to secure software. CyberSecurity Challenges (CSC) form a method that combines serious game techniques with cybersecurity and secure coding guidelines to raise secure coding awareness of software developers in the industry. These cybersecurity awareness events have been used with success in industrial environments. However, until now, these coached events took place on-site. In the present work, we briefly introduce cybersecurity challenges and propose a novel platform that allows these events to take place online. The introduced cybersecurity awareness platform, which the authors call Sifu, performs automatic assessment of challenges in compliance to secure coding guidelines, and uses an artificial intelligence method to provide players with solution-guiding hints. Furthermore, due to its characteristics, the Sifu platform allows for remote (online) learning, in times of social distancing. The CyberSecurity Challenges events based on the Sifu platform were evaluated during four online real-life CSC events. We report on three surveys showing that the Sifu platform’s CSC events are adequate to raise industry software developers awareness on secure coding. Artificial intelligence. Awareness.

Analysis of national cybersecurity strategies. —Nowadays the use of information and communication technology has been incorporated in a general way in the daily life of a nation allowing the optimization in its processes. However, with it comes serious risks and threats that can affect cyber security because of the vulnerability they show. In addition, there are several factors that contribute to the proliferation of criminal actions in cyber security, the profitability offered by its exploitation in economic, political or other terms, the ease and low cost of the tools used to carry out attacks and the ease of hiding the attacker, make it possible for these activities to be carried out anonymously, from anywhere in the world and with impunity.The main objective of the research is to analyze and design National Cybersecurity Strategies to counter attacks. The methodology of this research was conducted in an exploratory and descriptive manner. As a result of the research work, a design of National Cybersecurity Strategies was obtained after an in-depth analysis of the appropriate strategies and thus minimizing the different attacks that can be carried out.

Ensuring Cybersecurity of Digital Production Using Modern Neural Network Methods. Abstract: The transition from the information economy to the digital one presents new challenges for society associated with the development of disruptive technologies, a network of cyber-physical systems, artificial intelligence and big data. When creating digital platforms, a number of difficulties arise: the large size of the digital infrastructure and its heterogeneity, poorly established information interaction between segments, the lack of a unified approach to ensuring cybersecurity and a high dependence on the qualifications of personnel and equipment reliability. The introduction of the digital economy leads to an increase in the risk of cyber threats associated with access control problems between information flow regulation and control systems. To solve the problems of detecting cyber threats, it is proposed to use generative adversarial neural networks. Algorithms for learning and testing a neural network were presented. The results of the experiments have demonstrated that the proposed solution is highly accurate in detecting cyberattacks. artificial intelligence. cybersecurity. digital manufacturing.

Analysis of Cybersecurity Standard and Framework Components. Satisfactory cybersecurity protection, encompassing all data security solutions, can only be achieved by adopting a cybersecurity framework that provides a structure and methodology for protecting critical digital assets. In addition, security experts recommend using cybersecurity standards which consist of a collection of best practices to protect organizations from cyber threats. However, many organizations, companies and governments lack experienced personnel in the cybersecurity domain, so they have difficulty adopting a standard approach or cybersecurity framework. Protecting organizations from cyber threats while demonstrating compliance with laws and standards is seen as extremely complex due to the difficulty on choosing the appropriate standard to be used. Moreover, lack of knowledge on the elements needed that offered by the standard is lead to the problem on identifying the started point where the protection will be began. Therefore, in this paper, a literature and the analysis is presented in identifying the elements of cybersecurity standard and framework that can be facilitate the organization or government on choosing the appropriate standard and framework to be used and utilized. The literature review was carried out to understand the various types of cybersecurity standards and frameworks and the analysis is conducted to identify the elements in each of them. In this paper, eight steps are presented and include the types of international standards, which are general, local regulation, as well as specific standards used in the industrial sector, to conclude the findings of the analysis. Furthermore, a relation map is presented using Writing a Literature Review release 2.0 approach to show the relationship between the literature review and future research. best practice. cybersecurity. domain. framework. guidelines. standards. 
Determination of cyber security ensuring behaviours of pre-service teachers. As cyber security attack rates increase, so do cyber security concerns. Cyber security is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security measures, risk management approaches, actions, education, applications, security and technologies that can be used in order to protect the cyber environment and user rights. The aim of this study is to determine the behaviours of pre-service teachers as this study's objective is to determine the behaviours of pre-service teachers regarding cyber security. This study is designed according to the quantitative research method and the Personal Cyber Security Ensuring Scale has been used. 144 pre-service teachers of two different universities who took up instructional technologies and material design courses in the 2019-2020 spring semester participated in the study. It has been observed that the participants frequently took measures when they noticed unreliable people and situations in the internet environment but took occasional measures in terms of not leaving any trace, taking precautions and protecting personal privacy.

Threats and Emerging Developments in Cyber Security. Cyber security plays a significant role in science. Data or information security is one of the crucial issues facing the world, when there is discussion about the rapidly growing cyber-crimes, the government and many corporations are taking many steps to stop such crimes. Driven by several different measures, cybercrime continues to expand day by day. In this review, the problems confronting cyber security from emerging technological advances and developments are briefly discussed and, in turn, the paper also reflects on the newest cyber security technologies, trends and other ethics throughout the cyber security field.

The pandemic, the acceleration of digital transformation and the impact on cyber security. As one report put it: We are living in an era of unprecedented technological innovation.1 That is certainly not hyperbole when one considers that 90% of the world's data has been produced in the past two years, due in no small part to the 26 billion smart devices now in circulation. Adopting new technologies, such as smart devices, may mean radically overhauling your existing operations to compete with more agile companies and serve demanding customers. However, those opportunities also mean threats. Digitisation means a bigger attack surface. Scott Wilson of eFax explains that digitisation without security is a recipe for disaster. Organisations need to ensure that they overcome the cultural obstacles holding back progress, provide the right support, and make decisions that will both secure and futureproof their organisations. 
Understanding the full cost of cyber security breaches. Media reports regularly highlight organisations that have experienced costly cyber attacks or other cyber security breaches. Such breaches can have far-reaching and long-running impacts, compromising systems and data, impacting relationships with customers, suppliers and partners, and in extreme situations becoming existential threats. As an example of the potentially significant costs involved, the cyber attack on TalkTalk, the UK telecommunications company, in 2016, is estimated to have cost up to £60m.1 When organisations are breached, many will recognise that they have been impacted in some way. But new research suggests that organisations rarely understand the full cost. Steven Furnell of the University of Nottingham and Harry Heyburn, Andrew Whitehead and Jayesh Navin Shah at Ipsos MORI examine the range of potential direct and indirect costs organisations can incur, and the varying timeframes over which these costs come to light. And they offer a data collection tool that can support organisations to fully capture the cost of breaches. 
Assessing and forecasting cybersecurity impacts. Cyberattacks constitute a major threat to most organizations. Beyond financial consequences, they may entail multiple impacts that need to be taken into account when making risk management decisions to allocate the required cybersecurity resources. Experts have traditionally focused on a technical perspective of the problem by considering impacts in relation with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. We adopt a more comprehensive approach identifying a broader set of generic cybersecurity objectives, the corresponding set of attributes, and relevant forecasting and assessment models. These are used as basic ingredients for decision support in cybersecurity risk management. Cybersecurity. Expert judgement. Forecasting. Multiattribute utility. Risk management. 
An introduction to cybersecurity at physical layer: Obstacles at radio channel to mitigate hackers' chance. Cybersecurity commonly focuses on higher layers of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, as it is a discipline associated to Computer Science. However, physical layer is the front line of the defence of a system against external attacks, and Electrical Engineering, concretely Radiofrequency Engineering, can provide tools to reinforce radio networks also in terms of information security. This paper analyses different techniques related to site shielding. From hard traditional shielding, similar to Faraday cages, to different soft shielding solutions as vegetation fences and frequency selective surfaces (FSS), the variety of solutions is broad and would be useful in actual deployments. Finally, Building Information Modelling (BIM) appears as an interesting tool that could be incorporated along the design and construction of an office building to improve the electromagnetic behaviour, and subsequently the cybersecurity issues of the communication networks hosted by the building itself.

When it comes to cyber security, ignorance isn't bliss – it's negligence. Given the rise of cybercrime targeting many small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the vast majority find themselves completely unprepared, having laboured under the misguided belief that they are too small to become a target of cybercrime. Rather than being too big to fail, they think they are too small to be noticed. The rise of cybercrime targeting small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) has left many of them unprepared, believing they are too small to be a target. Most SMBs are left in the dark as to their actual risk and ignore the threat until it's too late. By failing to understand their true cyber risk, these firms often neglect their obligations and spending when it comes to preventing cyber breaches. One solution may be to turn to managed detection and response (MDR) providers, but this requires care, explains Mark Sangster of eSentire. 
Cybersecurity for Smart Farming: Socio-Cultural Context Matters. Food security is a societal issue of increasing importance requiring careful consideration of the way we produce, process, and distribute food [2], [6]. Digital technologies are increasingly used to optimize processes to support these activities, and therefore, bear important implications for food security. In this article, we focus in particular on technologies used for an important aspect of such security-the effective production of sufficient food, or food availability. Technology has always been an integral part of humanity's efforts to optimize food production processes. Already thousands of years ago, farming tools such as plows were used, first by humans, then with animals, to improve conditions for planting crops and thereby increase yields. Modern food production has seen an explosion of both the amount and the sophistication of technologies used, and has increasingly moved to sophisticated digital technologies such as robots, sensor-driven systems, drones, and automated image analysis [11]. 
Time-based Gap Analysis of Cybersecurity Trends in Academic and Digital Media. This study analyzes cybersecurity trends and proposes a conceptual framework to identify cybersecurity topics of social interest and emerging topics that need to be addressed by researchers in the field. The insights drawn from this framework allow for a more proactive approach to identifying cybersecurity patterns and emerging threats that will ultimately improve the collective cybersecurity posture of the modern society. To achieve this, cybersecurity-oriented content in both media and academic corpora, disseminated between 2008 and 2018, were morphologically analyzed via text mining. A total of 3,556 academic papers obtained from the top-10 highly reputable cybersecurity academic conferences, and 4,163 news articles collected from the New York Times were processed. The LDA topic modeling followed optimal perplexity and coherence scores resulted in 12 trendy topics. Next, the time-based gap between these trendy topics was analyzed to measure the correlation between media and trendy academic topics. Both convergences and divergences between the two cybersecurity corpora were identified, suggesting a strong time-based correlation between these resources. This framework demonstrates the effective use of automated techniques to provide insights about cybersecurity topics of social interest and emerging trends and informs the direction of future academic research in this field. academic context.

Trailblazing the Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity Discipline: A Multi-Disciplinary Research Roadmap. Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs. We conclude this article with an introduction of the articles included in this special issue. adversarial machine learning. analytics. artificial intelligence. cyber threat intelligence.

Integrated outreach: Increasing engagement in computer science and cybersecurity. Research on innovative, integrated outreach programs guided three separate week-long outreach camps held across two summers (2018 and 2019). These camps introduced computer science through real-world applications and hands-on activities, each dealing with cybersecurity principles. The camps utilized low-cost hardware and free software to provide a total of 84 students (aged 10 to 18 years) a unique learning experience. Based on feedback from the 2018 camp, a new pre/post survey was developed to assess changes in participant knowledge and interest. Student participants in the 2019 iteration showed drastic changes in their cybersecurity content recall (33% pre vs. 96% post), cybersecurity concept identification within real-world scenarios, and exhibited an increased ability to recognize potential cybersecurity threats in their every-day lives (22% pre vs. 69% post). Finally, students’ self-reported interest-level before and after the camp show a positive increase across all student participants, with the number of students who where highly interested in cybersecurity more than doubling from 31% pre-camp to 65% post-camp. Implications for educators are large as these activities and experiences can be interwoven into traditional schooling as well as less formal camps as pure computer science or through integrated STEM.

Assessment of end-user susceptibility to cybersecurity threats in saudi arabia by simulating phishing attacks. Phishing attacks are cybersecurity threats that have become increasingly sophisticated. Phishing is a cyberattack that can be carried out using various approaches and techniques. Usually, an attacker uses trickery as well as fraudulent and disguised means to steal valuable personal information or to deceive the victim into running malicious code, thereby gaining access and controlling the victim’s systems. This study focuses on evaluating the level of cybersecurity knowledge and cyber awareness in Saudi Arabia. It is aimed at assessing end-user susceptibility through three phishing attack simulations. Furthermore, we elaborate on some of the concepts related to phishing attacks and review the steps required to launch such attacks. Subsequently, we briefly discuss the tools and techniques associated with each attack simulation. Finally, a comprehensive analysis is conducted to assess and evaluate the results. Attack simulation.

Social cybersecurity: an emerging science. With the rise of online platforms where individuals could gather and spread information came the rise of online cybercrimes aimed at taking advantage of not just single individuals but collectives. In response, researchers and practitioners began trying to understand this digital playground and the way in which individuals who were socially and digitally embedded could be manipulated. What is emerging is a new scientific and engineering discipline—social cybersecurity. This paper defines this emerging area, provides case examples of the research issues and types of tools needed, and lays out a program of research in this area. Dynamic network analysis. Review.

Cybersecurity becomes smart using artificial intelligent and machine learning approaches: An overview. With the rapid increasing of technology devices and the development of In-ternet, cyber-attacks are changing quickly and more and more attackers appear which lead more difficult threats in cybersecurity. Moreover, the world is facing Internet of Things devices which generate large volumes of data that cause a lot of new cyber threats. Cyber-crimes cost a lot and make companies lose millions of dollars every year. Cybersecurity is a top concern at many companies. So, we need smart approaches to protect data a-gainst different threats which are difficult to know. Recently, researchers are developing systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to create defense approaches and protect data with high level of security and less cost. AI can help companies to identify threats automatically and find links between potential risks fast. This form of identification eliminates human errors from the process. This paper discusses AI-based cybersecurity various models that focus on machine learning and deep leaning algorithms. The results of this study show that machine learning and deep learning that simulate the human mind are more effective approaches than the traditional ones to solve security problems.

A healthcare evaluation system based on automated weighted indicators with cross-indicators based learning approach in terms of energy management and cybersecurity. Objective: Hospital performance evaluation is vital in terms of managing hospitals and informing patients about hospital possibilities. Also, it plays a key role in planning essential issues such as electrical energy management and cybersecurity in hospitals. In addition to being able to make this measurement objectively with the help of various indicators, it can become very complicated with the participation of subjective expert thoughts in the process. Method: As a result of budget cuts in health expenditures worldwide, the necessity of using hospital resources most efficiently emerges. The most effective way to do this is to determine the evaluation criteria effectively. Machine learning (ML) is the current method to determine these criteria, determined by consulting with experts in the past. ML methods, which can remain utterly objective concerning all indicators, offer fair and reliable results quickly and automatically. Based on this idea, this study provides an automated healthcare system evaluation framework by automatically assigning weights to specific indicators. First, the ability of hands to be used as input and output is measured. Results: As a result of this measurement, indicators are divided into only input group (group A) and both input and output group (group B). In the second step, the total effect of each input on the output is calculated by using the indicators in group B as output sequentially using the random forest of the regression tree model. Conclusion: Finally, the total effect of each indicator on the healthcare system is determined. Thus, the whole system is evaluated objectively instead of a subjective evaluation based on a single output. Cross-indicators. Healthcare system evaluation. Hospital indicators.

Extending STPA with STRIDE to identify cybersecurity loss scenarios. Analyzing safety and security together in the concept stage of system development can reduce redundant work and inconsistency in the identification of safety and security requirements. STPA is a safety analysis technique that also allows analyzing security concerns. STPA does not employ threat models to identify loss scenarios. Threat models allow identifying, enumerating, and prioritizing potential threats from a hypothetical attacker's point of view. STRIDE is a widely employed threat model for identifying computer security threats. In this paper, we extend STPA with the STRIDE threat model to identify security loss scenarios and security requirements. We evaluate our approach in an example. The proposed STPA extension allowed performing a more complete analysis in the concept stage. Cybersecurity. Safety. Security. STAMP. STPA. STRIDE. 
Requirements for cybersecurity in agricultural communication networks. Agricultural cybersecurity is a rising concern because farming is becoming ever more reliant on computers and Internet access. During the last few years, the agrotechnology community, public sector, and researchers have been alerted to the problem and a significant amount of research has focused on the issue. However, the majority of the existing work focuses on external threats or specific parts of the farm technology ecosystem. This work examines the cybersecurity capabilities of individual farms and focuses on the farm local area network. the network and connected devices of six dairy farms in Finland are examined in detail. In addition, the farmers were interviewed in order to ascertain their opinions and understanding of agricultural cybersecurity. The results of the reviews were mixed. The physical cabling, for example, was all in good condition and followed appropriate regulations. On the other hand, network topology, malware protection, and system backups were not handled appropriately. Surveillance cameras typically did not work as expected. Often, the farmers did not know the network topology, the connected devices, or the details of individual devices in the network. In summary, the cybersecurity on the farms reviewed in this work was not handled optimally and significant improvements would be needed in order to secure the reviewed systems. However, since the approach of this work is qualitative in nature, care must be taken when generalizing the results. In conclusion, there is a significant need for improvements in agricultural cybersecurity on the level of individual farms. Many of the threats faced by farms are caused by their own activity or the physical environment and thus, emphasis must be put on improving their own situations. Agricultural cybersecurity.

Paperless ship navigation: cyber security weaknesses. Maritime transportation is backbone of globalized trade and the manufacturing supply chain as nowadays more than four fifths of world merchandise trade by volume is carried by ships. Safe navigation of ships of today depends heavily on cyber-physical systems, of which the central is the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS). The paperless ship navigation is allowed when the type approved ECDIS with official electronic navigation charts acts as an independent backup for the primary system. In this paper, we present an analysis of cyber security weaknesses of the paperless ship navigation that relies on two internetworked ECDIS workstations in the backup arrangement. The method of analysis is based on cyber security testing of the ECDIS workstations with an industry vulnerability scanner tool. The detected vulnerabilities are analysed in the context of ECDIS backup arrangement and safeguards implemented on board the paperless ship. The obtained results suggest that the critical cyber threat vectors result from uncontrolled internetworking of unmaintained ECDIS workstations with identical hardware and software configurations.

Appraisal of a Ship’s Cybersecurity efficiency: the case of piracy. New information technologies are beneficial for ship operations in terms of safety and utilisation of company resources. However, new cybercrime threats have emergedaffecting, both ship safety and security that need to be assessed and evaluated. At the moment, actions of the maritime industry to keep pace dealing with such threats are slow when compared with other business sectors. As a high concern, maritime pirates could take advantage of cybersecurity breaches to monitor ship activity and gain information for potential protective failures. In 2021 companies and seafarers should be able to demonstrate knowledge and safeguard policies of their companies. Nevertheless, there is limited discussion on how companies will educate seafarers for existing threats. Therefore, in this study, a risk-based methodology is proposed for evaluation of cybersecurity threats in the context of a piracy attack. STPA-SafeSec’s analysis is used to identify security threats, and FAHP is utilised for evaluating the severity of each security constraint. Audits on 15 ships with 315 seafarers indicated that there are significant security gaps mainly due to lack of awareness from operators and seafarers. However, physical security and network protection that already apply to ships are significant security strengths. Cybersecurity audit. Fuzzy-AHP. Maritime piracy. Ship Cybersecurity. Ship security.

A framework for effective corporate communication after cyber security incidents. A major cyber security incident can represent a cyber crisis for an organisation, in particular because of the associated risk of substantial reputational damage. As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach. It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective corporate communication after cyber security incidents. Corporate communication.

Forecasting technological positioning through technology knowledge redundancy: Patent citation analysis of IoT, cybersecurity, and Blockchain. Researchers and organizations are becoming increasingly interested in Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity and blockchain technology due to its ability to provide solutions to problems of classical centralized architecture. This research approaches the relative locations of a company in the technological network based on patent citations of the IoT cybersecurity and blockchain. To understand how the blockchain and IoT can be merged, it is important to have a better understanding of the emerging technologies of IoT, cybersecurity, and blockchain. We used patent analysis, and merged the patent co-citation analysis (PCA) approach with the patent family to obtain a complete data set analysis. After that, we generated the data using multiple software technologies such as CiteSpace, Pajek, and VOSViewer. We applied the Technology Knowledge Redundancy method for the patent citation network, used the main two indicators TKS (Technology Knowledge Status) and TKR (Technology Knowledge Reliability for the analysis, and then used the Derwent Innovations Index patent data.

Cybersecurity and e-commerce in free trade agreements. We are facing a digital age characterized by constant flows of goods and services, financial assets, people, information and communication. As a consequence, the world economy is increasingly connected, and digitalization has spread to such an extent that today's world economy is a digital one, which has come to break down commercial barriers that the traditional economy and politics were unable to. Security and trade policy concerns are nothing new. However, given the electronic nature of commercial transactions (e-commerce), this has taken on a new and urgent importance. Cyberspace is a space of flows, a virtual space that grows every day with the transactions that take place through the use of ICT. Governments of many countries have begun to develop cybersecurity strategies, while trying to promote the benefits of a hyperconnected and cyber-enabled world. This article analyzes how e-commerce policies promote the protection of cyberspace. Specifically regarding e-commerce, care must be taken so that the cybersecurity strategy does not become an obstacle or constraint to such electronic transactions. The protection of cyberspace must be carried out with a multi-stakeholder approach. These issues are also of public interest since threats to cyberspace can affect entire countries and societies.

A review of cyber security risks of power systems: from static to dynamic false data attacks. With the rapid development of the smart grid and increasingly integrated communication networks, power grids are facing serious cyber-security problems. This paper reviews existing studies on the impact of false data injection attacks on power systems from three aspects. First, false data injection can adversely affect economic dispatch by increasing the operational cost of the power system or causing sequential overloads and even outages. Second, attackers can inject false data to the power system state estimator, and this will prevent the operators from obtaining the true operating conditions of the system. Third, false data injection attacks can degrade the distributed control of distributed generators or microgrids inducing a power imbalance between supply and demand. This paper fully covers the potential vulnerabilities of power systems to cyber-attacks to help system operators understand the system vulnerability and take effective countermeasures.

Cybersecurity hazards and financial system vulnerability: a synthesis of literature. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the growing body of literature exploring the issues related to pervasive effects of cybersecurity risk on the financial system. As the cybersecurity risk has appeared as a significant threat to the financial sector, researchers and analysts are trying to understand this problem from different perspectives. There are plenty of documents providing conceptual discussions, technical analysis, and survey results, but empirical studies based on real data are yet limited. Besides, the international and national regulatory bodies suggest guidelines to help banks and financial institutions managing cyber risk exposure. In this paper, we synthesize relevant articles and policy documents on cybersecurity risk, focusing on the dimensions detrimental to the banking system’s vulnerability. Finally, we propose five new research avenues for consideration that may enhance our knowledge of cybersecurity risk and help practitioners develop a better cyber risk management framework.

Software engineering based self-checking process for cyber security system in VANET. Newly, the cyber security of vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) includes two practicable: Vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) that have been considered due to importance. It has become possible to keep pace with the development in the world. The people safety is a priority in the development of technology in general and particular in of VANET for police vehicles. In this paper, we propose a software engineering based self-checking process to ensure the high redundancy of the generated keys. These keys are used in underlying cyber security system for VANET. The proposed self-checking process emploies a set of NIST tests including frequency, block and runs as a threshold for accepting the generated keys. The introduced cyber security system includes three levels: Firstly, the registration phase that asks vehicles to register in the system, in which the network excludes the unregistered ones. In this phase, the proposed software engineeringbased self-checking process is adopted. Secondly, the authentication phase that checks of the vehicles after the registration phase. Thirdly, the proposed system that is able to detect the DOS attack. The obtained results show the efficient performance of the proposed system in managing the security of the VANET network. The self-checking process increased the randomness of the generated keys, in which the security factor is increased. Copyright . Cyber security. Engineering vanet. NIST. Self-checking process.

In a computing context, cybersecurity is undergoing massive shifts in technology and its operations in recent days, and data science is driving the change. Extracting security incident patterns or insights from cybersecurity data and building corresponding data-driven model, is the key to make a security system automated and intelligent. To understand and analyze the actual phenomena with data, various scientific methods, machine learning techniques, processes, and systems are used, which is commonly known as data science. In this paper, we focus and briefly discuss on cybersecurity data science, where the data is being gathered from relevant cybersecurity sources, and the analytics complement the latest data-driven patterns for providing more effective security solutions. The concept of cybersecurity data science allows making the computing process more actionable and intelligent as compared to traditional ones in the domain of cybersecurity. We then discuss and summarize a number of associated research issues and future directions. Furthermore, we provide a machine learning based multi-layered framework for the purpose of cybersecurity modeling. Overall, our goal is not only to discuss cybersecurity data science and relevant methods but also to focus the applicability towards data-driven intelligent decision making for protecting the systems from cyber-attacks.

Interoperable pipelines for social cyber-security: assessing Twitter information operations during NATO Trident Juncture 2018. Social cyber-security is an emergent field defining a multidisciplinary and multimethodological approach to studying and preserving the free and open exchange of information online. This work contributes to burgeoning scholarship in this field by advocating the use of interoperable pipelines of computational tools. We demonstrate the utility of such a pipeline in a case study of Twitter information operations during the NATO Trident Juncture Exercises in 2018. By integratively utilizing tools from machine learning, natural language processing, and dynamic network analysis, we uncover significant bot activity aiming to discredit NATO targeted to key allied nations. We further show how to extend such analysis through drill-down procedures on individual influencers and influential subnetworks. We reflect on the value of interoperable pipelines for accumulating and triangulating insights that enable social cyber-security analysts to draw relevant insights across various scales of granularity.

Social cyber forensics: leveraging open source information and social network analysis to advance cyber security informatics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social cyber forensics and its usability. Then, we introduce a tool, i.e., Maltego that can be used to study the cross-media affiliation and uncover hidden relations among various online groups. We also provide three stepwise methodologies that leverage Maltego and various open source information to uncover the hidden relationship among (1) Twitter accounts and a set of websites/blogs. (2) websites/blogs and other websites/blogs. or (3) infer the ownership of a set of websites/blogs. These methodologies have been tested during many cyber propaganda campaigns that were projected against NATO forces. A high-level view of these case studies that leveraged the concepts and methodologies provided in this paper are briefly highlighted here while the details of each case were published in various venues which are pointed out for interested readers.

The dark triad and insider threats in cyber security. Tracing the relationship between pathological personality traits and insider cyber sabotage is critical to addressing cyber threats in real-time. Understanding the individual, social, and organizational influences on insider threats is important to the development of security-related policies and controls. Cyber sabotage as part of a broader insider threat issue is addressed in the context of an organizational security risk management plan. Such plans should include security controls intended to mitigate the risk of a human threat from the inside. In the US, in some cases in which classified material is involved, formal insider threat cyber security programs are mandated by Presidential Executive Order. The security controls prescribed by insider threat programs often include automated employee monitoring systems for detection, education and training programs for awareness.. 
Cybersecurity Attacks in Vehicular Sensors. Today's modern vehicles contain anywhere from sixty to one-hundred sensors and exhibit the characteristics of Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS). There is a high degree of coupling, cohesiveness, and interactions among vehicle's CPS components (e.g., sensors, devices, systems, systems-of-systems) across sensing, communication, and control layers. Cyber-attacks in the sensing or communication layers can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides a detailed review of potential cyber threats related to the sensing layer. Notably, the focus is mainly towards two categories of sensors: vehicle dynamics sensors (e.g., Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS), magnetic encoders, and inertial sensors) and environment sensors (e.g., Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), ultrasonic, camera, Radio Detection and Ranging (Radar) systems, and Global Positioning System (GPS) units). The paper also offers perspectives through existing countermeasures from literature and stresses the need for data-driven cybersecurity solutions.

Taking Risks With Cybersecurity: Using Knowledge and Personal Characteristics to Predict Self-Reported Cybersecurity Behaviors. Individuals’ use of insecure cybersecurity behaviors, including the use of weak passwords, is a leading contributor to cybersecurity breaches. While training individuals on best practices in cybersecurity continues to be implemented, prior research has found that training people in the use of secure passwords has not proven to be effective. Developing profiles of individual who are likely to become victims of password hacking, phishing scams, and other types of breaches would be useful, as they could be used to identify individuals with the highest likelihood of engaging in insecure cybersecurity behaviors. The present research tested the hypothesis that in addition to self-reported cybersecurity knowledge, personal characteristics, such as personality traits and general risk-taking behavior not related to technology use, can predict individual differences in cybersecurity behaviors, as measured by self-report. Our hypothesis was confirmed in a large study involving 325 undergraduates. Participants provided information about their self-reported risky cybersecurity behaviors (e.g., using non-secure Wi-Fi, not logging out of accounts on shared computers, etc.), self-reported knowledge about strong/weak passwords, Big Five personality traits (i.e., extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and mood instability), sensation-seeking personality traits, and general risk-taking unrelated to using technology. The results of a hierarchical regression indicated that 34% of risky cybersecurity behavior was significantly predicted by the combination of self-reported knowledge about strong/weak passwords, personality traits, and risk-taking in daily life. The results suggest that victim profiles should take into account individual differences in personality and general risk-taking in domains unrelated to cybersecurity in addition to cybersecurity knowledge. cybersecurity.

Wireless sensor network in agriculture: Model of cyber security. Nowadays, wireless sensor networks (WSN) are widely used in agriculture monitoring to improve the quality and productivity of farming. In this application, sensors gather different types of data (i.e., humidity, carbon dioxide level, and temperature) in real-time scenarios. Thus, data gathering, transmission, and rapid response to new circumstances require a secured data mechanism to avoid malicious adversaries. Therefore, this paper focuses on data security from the data origin source to the end-user, and proposes a general data security model that is independent of the network topology and structure, and can be widely used in the agriculture monitoring application. The developed model considers practical aspects, the architecture of the sensor node, as well as the necessity to save energy while ensuring data security, and optimize the model through the application of organizational and technical measures. The model evaluation is conducted through simulation in terms of energy consumption. The result shows that the proposed model ensures good data security at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption at receiver and sender nodes, and energy consumption per bit, up to 2%, 7%, and 1.3%, respectively, due to overhead added for authentication in the network.

Cybersecurity resiliency of marine renewable energy systems–part 1: Identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities and determining risk. Technology innovation, market demand, and the potential impacts of a chang-ing climate are driving the marine renewable energy (MRE) industry to develop market-ready systems to provide low-carbon electricity for emerging, off-grid markets. The advanced operational and information technology devices used in MRE systems create a pathway for a cyber threat actor to gain unauthorized ac-cess to data or disrupt operation. To improve the resiliency of MRE systems as a predictable, affordable, and reliable source of energy from oceans and rivers, guidance was developed for an end users’ organization that describes a framework for identifying and managing cybersecurity risk. The development of the cyber-security guidance is based on standards described in the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This paper is the first of a two-part series that describes an approach to determine the cybersecurity risk for MRE systems based on assessing potential cyber threats, identifying vulnerabilities (people, processes, and technology, including physical and operational environment), and evaluating the consequences a cyberattack would have on operation of the MRE system and impact on end users’ mission and business objectives. MRE developers and stakeholders can use this approach to assess their current cybersecurity risk posture to incorporate appropri-ate cybersecurity controls to reduce the consequences and impacts from a cyber-attack on MRE systems. This approach can be refined further as MRE systems are deployed and operational configurations are available. Cyber threats. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk assessment. Marine renewable energy.

So if Mr Blue Head here clicks the link⋯ Risk Thinking in Cyber Security Decision Making. Cyber security decision making is inherently complicated, with nearly every decision having knock-on consequences for an organisation's vulnerability and exposure. This is further compounded by the fact that decision-making actors are rarely security experts and may have an incomplete understanding of the security that the organisation currently has in place. They must contend with a multitude of possible security options that they may only partially understand. This challenge is met by decision makers' risk thinking - their strategies for identifying risks, assessing their severity, and prioritising responses. We study the risk thinking strategies employed by teams of participants in an existing dataset derived from a tabletop cyber-physical systems security game. Our analysis identifies four structural patterns of risk thinking and two reasoning strategies: risk-first and opportunity-first. Our work highlights that risk-first approaches (as prescribed by the likes of NIST-800-53 and ISO 27001) are followed neither substantially nor exclusively when it comes to decision making. Instead, our analysis finds that decision making is affected by the plasticity of teams - that is, the ability to readily switch between ideas and practising both risk-first and opportunity-first reasoning. cyber security. cyber security professions.

The impact of cybersecurity on the regulatory legal framework for maritime security. The concepts of maritime safety and maritime security were based, originally, on different aims, objectives, and perspectives. However, currently, most of the international maritime safety conventions have started to cover both aspects. In the analysis of most incidents and accidents at sea, it is quite difficult to delimit safety and security matters and, normally, after a breakdown, it is useless to do it since the planning and response to risks are usually given in an integrated manner. On the other hand, we are witnessing a progressive extension of the concept of maritime safety to include protection (or security) matters simultaneously with the emergence of a new type of threats that are always present from the moment computers are connected to networks anywhere the world: cyber threats! With ships equipped with new advanced technologies, protection against cyber-attacks is more important than ever. These technological advances have become an easy and high-priority target for cyber criminals. With this behaviour, they can pursue their purpose of attacking ships’ systems and, from them, different systems ashore. The digitization of the maritime industry took place very quickly. However, it has become essential for seafarers not only to understand and adopt these new technologies, but also to take a cautious attitude towards certain events that can follow in the wrong direction in a short period of time. A new stage of maritime readiness is envisaged, which needs a robust and well-defined code that broadens and concretizes a new concept of maritime safety in the broad sense that reinforces international maritime conventions and their application. The responsibilities of the Flag States and Port States, under the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and international maritime conventions as laid down in the different Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) at world level and in the documents of the IMO and other international organizations (such as the European Union), should be updated and start to consider, also, maritime security matters. In addition, it is essential to support close cooperation in the fields of maritime safety and maritime security with a view to drawing up a new and robust Maritime Code. This will be the guideline pursued, with the intention, at this moment, to shake and roll this matter towards a new regulatory stage. Cybersecurity. Flag State. Maritime safety. Maritime security.

Models and algorithms for ensuring functional stability and cybersecurity of virtual cloud resources. The article proposes a model that describes the effects of cyber attacks on virtual cloud resources (VCR) of various informatization objects (IO). The developed model served as the basis for an algorithm that allows to analyze threats in the IO cloud environment. The proposed algorithm in this work allows to obtain attack routes, that is achieved by synthesizing the attack graph and the graph of the correlative alert about the state of the IO virtual cloud environment (VCE). There is proposed a model for assessing the state of VCR. This model has become the basis for the algorithm for choosing countermeasures to protect the IO VCE. Ultimately, the proposed solutions allow to obtain a calculated indicator of functional stability (FS) and cybersecurity (CS) of IO virtual resources. And then to form countermeasures for increasing the FS and CS index of IO virtual cloud resources. During the research, there was developed a technique for providing FS and VCE CS based on software-configured networks. The developed technique allows to focus the attention of the protection side on increasing the FS and CS of virtual machines on the basis of the attacks detection and subsequent reconfiguration of virtual networks in VCE.

Cybersecurity challenges in industry: Measuring the challenge solve time to inform future challenges. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in industrial control systems have been steadily increasing over the last few years. One possible way to address this issue is through raising the awareness (through education) of software developers, with the intent to increase software quality and reduce the number of vulnerabilities. CyberSecurity Challenges (CSCs) are a novel serious game genre that aims to raise industrial software developers’ awareness of secure coding, secure coding guidelines, and secure coding best practices. An important industry-specific requirement to consider in designing these kinds of games is related to the whole event’s duration and how much time it takes to solve each challenge individually—the challenge solve time. In this work, we present two different methods to compute the challenge solve time: one method based on data collected from the CSC dashboard and another method based on a challenge heartbeat. The results obtained by both methods are presented. both methods are compared to each other, and the advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a player profile, which is derived from dashboard data. Our results and contributions aim to establish a method to measure the challenge solve time, inform the design of future challenges, and improve coaching during CSC gameplay. Capture-the-flag.

Measuring Systemic Risk of Switching Attacks Based on Cybersecurity Technologies in Substations. This paper describes the derivation of steady-state probabilities of the power communication infrastructure based on today's cybersecurity technologies. The elaboration of steady-state probabilities is established on (i) modified models developed such as password models, (ii) new models on digital relays representing the authentication mechanism, and (iii) models for honeypots/honeynet within a substation network. A generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN) is utilized to formulate the detailed statuses and transitions of components embedded in a cyber-net. Comprehensive steady-state probabilities are quantitatively and qualitatively performed. The methodologies on how transition probabilities and rates are extracted from the network components and a conclusion of actuarial applications is discussed.

Supply chain 4.0: A survey of cyber security challenges, solutions and future directions. Supply chain 4.0 denotes the fourth revolution of supply chain management systems, integrating manufacturing operations with telecommunication and Information Technology processes. Although the overarching aim of supply chain 4.0 is the enhancement of production systems within supply chains, making use of global reach, increasing agility and emerging technology, with the ultimate goal of increasing efficiency, timeliness and profitability, Supply chain 4.0 suffers from unique and emerging operational and cyber risks. Supply chain 4.0 has a lack of semantic standards, poor interoperability, and a dearth of security in the operation of its manufacturing and Information Technology processes. The technologies that underpin supply chain 4.0 include blockchain, smart contracts, applications of Artificial Intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Each of these technologies, individually and combined, create cyber security issues that should be addressed. This paper explains the nature of the military supply chains 4.0 and how it uniquely differs from the commercial supply chain, revealing their strengths, weaknesses, dependencies and the fundamental technologies upon which they are built. This encompasses an assessment of the cyber risks and opportunities for research in the field, including consideration of connectivity, sensing and convergence of systems. Current and emerging semantic models related to the standardization, development and safety assurance considerations for implementing new technologies into military supply chains 4.0 are also discussed. This is examined from a holistic standpoint and through technology-specific lenses to determine current states and implications for future research directions. Blockchain. Cyber security.

Recent advances in noninvasive biosensors for forensics, biometrics, and cybersecurity. Recently, biosensors have been used in an increasing number of different fields and disciplines due to their wide applicability, reproducibility, and selectivity. Three large disciplines in which this has become relevant has been the forensic, biometric, and cybersecurity fields. The call for novel noninvasive biosensors for these three applications has been a focus of research in these fields. Recent advances in these three areas has relied on the use of biosensors based on primarily colorimetric assays based on bioaffinity interactions utilizing enzymatic assays. In forensics, the use of different bodily fluids for metabolite analysis provides an alternative to the use of DNA to avoid the backlog that is currently the main issue with DNA analysis by providing worthwhile information about the originator. In biometrics, the use of sweat-based systems for user authentication has been developed as a proof-of-concept design utilizing the levels of different metabolites found in sweat. Lastly, biosensor assays have been developed as a proof-of-concept for combination with cybersecurity, primarily cryptography, for the encryption and protection of data and messages. Biometrics.

Exploring expert perceptions about the cyber security and privacy of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: A thematic analysis approach. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) constitute an automotive development carrying paradigm-shifting potential that may soon be embedded into a dynamically changing urban mobility landscape. The complex machine-led dynamics of CAVs make them more prone to data exploitation and vulnerable to cyber attacks than any of their predecessors increasing the risks of privacy breaches and cyber security violations for their users. This can adversely affect the public acceptability of CAVs, give them a bad reputation at this embryonic stage of their development, create barriers to their adoption and increased use, and complicate the business models of their future operations. Therefore, it is vital to identify and create an in-depth understanding of the cyber security and privacy issues associated with CAVs, and of the way these can be prioritised and addressed. This work employs 36 semi-structured elite interviews to explore the diverse dimensions of user acceptance through the lens of the well-informed CAV experts that already anticipate problems and look for their solutions. Our international interviewee sample represents academia, industry and policy-making so that all the key stakeholder voices are heard. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors that reflect and affect CAV acceptance in relation to the privacy and cyber security agendas. Six core themes emerged: awareness, user and vendor education, safety, responsibility, legislation, and trust. Each of these themes has diverse and distinctive dimensions and are discussed as sub-themes. We recommend that mitigating the cyber security and privacy risks embedded in CAVs require inter-institutional cooperation, awareness campaigns and trials for trust-building purposes, mandatory educational training for manufacturers and perhaps more importantly for end-users, balanced and fair responsibility-sharing, two-way dynamic communication channels and a clear consensus on what constitutes threats and solutions.

AI for beyond 5G Networks: A Cyber-Security Defense or Offense Enabler?. Artificial intelligence (Ai) is envisioned to play a pivotal role in empowering intelligent, adaptive and autonomous security management in 5G and beyond networks, thanks to its potential to uncover hidden patterns from a large set of time-varying multi-dimensional data, and deliver faster and accurate decisions. Unfortunately, Ai's capabilities and vulnerabilities make it a double-edged sword that may jeopardize the security of future networks. This article sheds light on how Ai may impact the security of 5G and its successor from its posture of defender, offender or victim, and recommends potential defenses to safeguard from malevolent Ai while pointing out their limitations and adoption challenges. 
Ethics in cybersecurity research and practice. This paper critiques existing governance in cyber-security ethics through providing an overview of some of the ethical issues facing researchers in the cybersecurity community and highlighting shortfalls in governance practice. We separate these issues into those facing the academic research community and those facing the (corporate) practitioner community, drawing on two case studies. While there is overlap between these communities, there are also stark differences. Academic researchers can often rely on research ethics boards (REBs) to provide ethical oversight and governance which are typically unavailable to the practitioner community. However, we argue that even within the academic community the constitution of REBs is such that they may be (and in some cases at least are) unable to offer sound advice. Our recommendations are that ethics should be taught in far greater depth on computer science courses than is currently the case, and that codes of conduct should be developed and deployed provided they can be seen to be effective. In tandem with these, an active discussion regarding the ethics of cybersecurity and cybersecurity research is urgently needed. Cybersecurity. Discrimination. Ethics. IRB. Personal data. Privacy.

Electricity system resilience in a world of increased climate change and cybersecurity risk. The shift to widely distributed forms of energy generation and storage, requiring increased interconnectivity to geographically balance supply with distributed demand for electricity, creates a more complex electrical network – the ‘Internet of Energy’. A growing array of threats now impact the resilience of the electrical network including digitalisation, cybersecurity, technological changes of the power system, and the potential for climate change to expose the system to more extreme weather events. Whether distributed and renewable electricity systems will be more resilient through multiple pathways and redundancy, or less resilient due to greater cybersecurity risks than a conventional centralised electricity system, is the key focus of this paper.

When believing in technology leads to poor cyber security: Development of a trust in technical controls scale. While technical controls can reduce vulnerabilities to cyber threats, no technology provides absolute protection and we hypothesised that people may act less securely if they place unwarranted trust in these automated systems. This paper describes the development of a Trust in Technical Controls Scale (TTCS) that measures people's faith in four of these technical controls. In an online study (N = 607), Australian employees demonstrated a greater degree of trust in firewalls and anti-virus software than they did in spam filters and social media privacy settings. Lower scores on the four item TTCS were related to better information security awareness (ISA) and higher scores on tests of cognitive abilities such as non-verbal IQ and cognitive reflection. The TTCS predicted an individual's ability to detect a phishing email to a similar degree as other factors such as ISA, non-verbal IQ and cognitive impulsivity. However, unlike ISA, the scale did not predict the strength of passwords people constructed. Results suggest that the TTCS is a useful complement to ISA in understanding and predicting certain cyber security behaviours. Cognitive abilities. Cyber security. Human-automation interaction.

Cybersecurity for railways – A maturity model. With the advancements in and widespread adoption of information and communication technologies in infrastructures, cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent and more severe. Advanced cybersecurity threats with automated capabilities are increasing in such sectors as finance, health, grid, retail, government, telecommunications, transportation, etc. Cyber-attacks are also increasing in railways with an impact on railway stakeholders, e.g. threat to the safety of employees, passengers, or the public in general. loss of sensitive railway information. reputational damage. monetary loss. erroneous decisions. loss of dependability, etc. There is a need to move towards advanced security analytics and automation to identify, respond to, and prevent such security breaches. The objective of this research is to reduce cyber risks and vulnerabilities and to improve the cybersecurity capabilities of railways by evaluating their cybersecurity maturity levels and making recommendations for improvements. After assessing various cybersecurity maturity models, the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) was selected to assess the cybersecurity capabilities of railway organizations. The contributions of this research are as follows. First, a new maturity level MIL4 (Maturity Indicator Level 4) is introduced in the C2M2 model. Second, the C2M2 model is adapted by adding advanced security analytics and threat intelligence to develop the Railway-Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (R-C2M2). The cybersecurity maturity of three railway organizations is evaluated using this model. Third, recommendations and available standards & guidelines are provided to the three railway organizations to improve maturity levels within different domains. In addition, they are given an action plan to implement the recommendations in a streamlined way. The application of this model will allow railway organizations to improve their capability to reduce the impacts of cyber-attacks and eradicate vulnerabilities. The approach can also be extended to other infrastructures with necessary adaptations. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model. maturity level. railway organizations.

Knowledge triple extraction in cybersecurity with adversarial active learning [融合对抗主动学习的网络安全知识三元组抽取]. Aiming at the problem that using pipeline methods for extracting cybersecurity knowledge triples may cause the errors propagation of entity recognition and did not consider the correlation between entity recognition and relation extraction, and training triple extraction model lacked labeled corpora, an end-to-end cybersecurity knowledge triple extraction method with adversarial active learning was proposed. For knowledge triple extraction, the conventional entity recognition and relation extraction were modelled as sequence labeling task through joint labeling strategy firstly. And then, a BiLSTM-LSTM-based model with dynamic attention mechanism was designed to jointly extract entities and relations, forming triples. Finally, with adversarial learning framework, a discriminator was trained to incrementally select high-quality samples for labeling, and the performance of the joint extraction model was continuously enhanced by iterative retraining. Experiments show that the proposed joint extraction model outperforms the existing cybersecurity knowledge triple extraction methods, and demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed adversarial active learning scheme.

The Illusion of Choice in Discussing Cybersecurity Safeguards between Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Their Caregivers. Although continual online interaction is beneficial for an older adult with mild cognitive impairment, cybersecurity risks can become more pronounced. Prior work has touted the benefit of shared decision-making between care recipients and caregivers who may want to instill cybersecurity safeguards, particularly in the area of online safety and security. In this study we investigated the current online safety and security decision-making practices of care recipients with mild cognitive impairment and their spousal caregivers. We identified a gap between optative and actual decision-making: whereas couples expressed their desire to engage in shared decision-making, the actuality was most caregivers were compelled to take sole action. We further determined that shared-decision making was not feasible as there was a lack of suitable safeguarding options along a spectrum of care for the couple to choose from. We relate these findings to prior work that highlights similar challenges and discuss how there needs to be more offered than simply an illusion of choice. care. caregivers. cybersecurity. dementia. mild cognitive impairment. privacy. safeguards. safety. security. 
Boosting cybersecurity in communication gateways for better substation protection and control. With a significant surge in distributed energy resources (DERs) and energy storage systems (ESS), alongside the upward trend of unmanned substations, power grids have become a lot more complex. Therefore, digital substations increasingly play an important role in power transmissions, providing stability and flexibility with regards to power supply. However, converting all substations to digital at once is not so straightforward due to limited budgets to retrofit the large number of serial-based legacy devices. Communications gateways can help overcome these concerns as they help serial-based legacy intelligence electronic devices (IEDs) communicate with Ethernet-based networks. they are also a cost-effective solution. With the serial-to-Ethernet problem solved, however, another issue raises its head: cyberattacks always pose huge threats to Ethernet-based networks, putting the issue of cybersecurity in retrofit power substations at the forefront. In substation retrofitting projects, communication gateways act as data concentrators managing the large numbers of legacy IEDs. In spite of their significantly important role, communication gateways rarely incorporate adequate security measures. Therefore, a high risk exists that malicious actors can easily access legacy IEDs through these gateways to cause power outages or even damage critical equipment to endanger people’s lives and cause huge financial losses. To eliminate these risks, a three-pronged approach, which entails baseline security requirements for communication gateways, communication protocol encryption, and role- based access control (RBAC), is recommended to secure communication gateways in networks. Using network devices equipped with basic security capabilities and that are IEC 62443-4-2 compliant is an effective precautionary measure to ward off cyberattacks. These basic security capabilities should include password cracking defense, sniffer and data breach prevention, tamper-resistant configuration files or programs, DDoS defense, and the account and identifier management. Furthermore, the monitoring and controlling of IEDs in refurbished substations requires more stable and secure network infrastructure so that the status of network devices, such as switches, IEDs, and communication gateways, is available at all times. All Ethernet devices should have a MIB-like function, such as SNMP technology, to monitor and maintain the devices. SNMPv3 is highly recommended because of its enhanced security design. Networks are especially vulnerable to cyberattacks if data from Ethernet-based communications protocols is unencrypted. Once hackers have invaded a substation’s network, they can easily capture data and learn a lot about a network’s communication behavior. What’s more, they can easily cause havoc by sending a misleading command to control an IED. To counteract these types of malicious activities, communication gateways should employ Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for communication protocols such as Modbus, DNP3.0, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850. TLS v1.2 or later is highly recommended, as it is reported that TLS v1.0 has major vulnerabilities and TLS v1.1 has outdated encryption methods. With regards to the misoperation of assets, role-based access control (RBAC) is the ideal model to address this issue, especially in complex systems. Most incidents of misoperation occur when engineers have access to information or sections of a network that do not pertain to their job function, creating a setting ripe for mishaps. More importantly, no matter whether employees get promoted or resign, their privilege level must be adjusted or revoked accordingly. Thus, network access should be based on the roles of individual users within the network, and communication gateways should be capable of assigning the necessary permission for access to the different role players.

Manar: An arabic game-based application aimed for teaching cybersecurity using image processing. —People use the Internet for various activities, including exchanging money, playing games, and shopping. However, this powerful network came at a cost: the features that provide the Internet with these capabilities are also what make it vulnerable. The need for cybersecurity tools and practices was recognized, especially for children, since they tend to be naive and can be easily tricked. Aimed at children from 6 to 12 years old, Manar is an Arabic smartphone game that seeks to build a generation who are well-informed about cybersecurity issues. It teaches them about notable cybersecurity topics such as social engineering and cryptography, it also has a very appealing theme to attract children to play the game. The theme being pirates and islands, each level will be represented as an island and a moving pirate ship will navigate between the levels. The application introduces the technology of image processing in a unique way, allowing children to move around and look for objects, which makes the game as interactive as possible to attract children’s attention.

Effectiveness of security incident event management (SIEM) system for cyber security situation awareness. Cyber-attacks have always targeted information communication technology systems of various organizations. Intruders and hackers have within their reach, very powerful tools through which they capable to bypass the existing network security so as to deliver a payload that might have a severe impact on the whole organization. Therefore, it has become essential for organizations to develop mechanisms through which they can detect a possible cyber threat and then respond accordingly. By establishing cybersecurity situation awareness, organizations will understand what is happening and then respond effectively. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of the Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) system for Cyber Security Situation Awareness. A Hierarchical Network Security Situation Assessment Model (referred to HNSSAM) which joins Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) system evidence theory fusion rules with classified quantitative risk assessment method was applied. Data processing was initially designed so as to collect security data from various sensors. Mechanisms for data verification were then adopted so as to establish whether SIEM was effective in successfully detecting any form of cyber-attack. Results show that SIEM tools may be applied by security analysts to gain visibility into the security threats attacking the IT systems of an organization and then respond appropriately.

Evaluation of Montenegrin seafarers’ awareness of cyber security. Topics on maritime cyber security have undoubtedly been attracting great public attention in recent days. The reasons are rapidly evolving computing technologies and digitalization in maritime sector. A successful cyber-attack may have catastrophic consequences and a harmful impact on people, properties or marine environment. In addition to numerous factors that pave the way for a successful cyber-attack on ships, human errors are also in the limelight as they are notorious sources of cyber-attacks today. In this research paper, the authors examine Montenegrin seafarers’ level of familiarisation with current cybersecurity risks by conducting a structured survey questionnaire. After thoroughly analysing the collected answers, the authors realise that the respondents have an insufficient level of cybersecurity knowledge and awareness. Lastly, using the quantitative risk assessment method, the authors propose the best practices for maritime cyber security in the form of implementation of mandatory training course. Cyber security.

Agent-based approach to the design of a multimodal interface for cyber-security event visualisation control. Convenient human-computer interaction is essential to carry out many exhausting and concentration-demanding activities. One of them is cyber-situational awareness as well as dynamic and static risk analysis. A specific design method for a multimodal human-computer interface (HCI) for cyber-security events visualisation control is presented. The main role of the interface is to support security analysts and network operators in their monitoring activities. The proposed method of designing HCIs is adapted from the methodology of robot control system design. Both kinds of systems act by acquiring information from the environment, and utilise it to drive the devices influencing the environment. In the case of robots the environment is purely physical, while in the case of HCIs it encompasses both the physical ambience and part of the cyber-space. The goal of the designed system is to efficiently support a human operator in the presentation of cyberspace events such as incidents or cyber-attacks. Especially manipulation of graphical information is necessary. As monitoring is a continuous and tiring activity, control of how the data is presented should be exerted in as natural and convenient way as possible. Hence two main visualisation control modalities have been assumed for testing: Static and dynamic gesture commands and voice commands, treated as supplementary to the standard interaction. The presented multimodal interface is a component of the Operational Centre, which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Creation of the interface out of embodied agents proved to be very useful in the specification phase and facilitated the interface implementation. Cyber security visualisation. Embodied agent.

A south african legal perspective on the regulation of net neutrality and its implications for cyber-security and cyber-warfare. With the approval of Articles 11 and 13 in Europe, net neutrality has become a contentious issue globally. These articles refer to European Union (EU) copyright law, which could possibly destroy the freedom of the internet that once existed. Throughout Europe it has become known as the meme ban, referring to the censorship elements. While there is much opposition to these articles, its supporters consider it necessary for the preservation for creative works online. Opposition to the legislation, which includes certain websites and internet presences, remains of the opinion that these two pieces of legislation will mean an end to meme culture and user-generated content. Along with the limitation to the freedom of the internet, cyber-security and cyber-warfare risks and vulnerabilities are imminent. This paper seeks to provide an in-depth discussion on the implications of neutrality on cyber-security and cyber-warfare. Cyber Sovereignt. Cyber-Security. Cyber-Warfare. Legislation.

Understanding the relationship between the dark triad of personality traits and neutralization techniques toward cybersecurity behaviour. This study considers the framework of neutralization techniques, which responds to the attitude/ rationalization leg of the fraud triangle with respect to the dark triad of personality traits' predictability toward compliant cybersecurity behaviour. Logically, organizations focus on reducing the insider's motivation and opportunities for malfeasance. However, it may be prudent to consider the rationalization for insider crime, which is arguably the most obscure element. This study is a unique contribution as it considers both the roles of neutralization techniques and the dark triad of personality traits with respect to insider threats and compliance intention. Furthermore, the specific categories of neutralization techniques will be considered as antecedents towards insider maleficence. Behaviour. Cybersecurity. Dark Triad of Personality Traits.

Research on blockchain evaluation methods under the classified protection of cybersecurity [网络安全等级保护下的区块链评估方法]. A blockchain is a cryptographic distributed database and network transaction accounting system. In the current era of major technological changes, blockchain technology, with its cryptographic structure, peer-to-peer (P2P) network, consensus mechanism, smart contract and other mechanisms, is decentralized, tamper-proof, and traceable and has become a hot spot in the development of informatization. Classified protection is one of the basic policies of information security in China. The implementation of the information security level protection system can not only guide various industries in performing security management in accordance with the equivalent security standards, but also ensure that supervision and evaluation institutions follow the laws and regulations, which is of significance to network security. As the application of blockchain technology in various industries is becoming more extensive, it is necessary to simultaneously promote the national classified protection of blockchain security assessment, which contributes to the sustainable and healthy development of blockchains in China. According to the revised assessment methods of grade protection, in addition to the status of universality requirements, evaluation specifications should be formulated for specific technologies and fields (such as cloud computing, mobile Internet, Internet of Things, industrial control, and big data). In view of the particularity of blockchain technology, China has initiated the formulation of blockchain evaluation specifications, but has not applied the level protection standards to the formulation of blockchain evaluation specifications. Therefore, the assessment requirements and enforcement proposals are specified for the blockchain's core technologies, such as P2P network, distributed ledger, consensus mechanism, and smart contracts, according to the application and data security layer requirements at Level 3. Moreover, the current running data of blockchains and their security audit mechanism based on the log workflow were summarized and analyzed respectively in compliance with the control points specified in classified protection 2.0. Our investigation indicates that blockchains can satisfy the requirements of evaluation items in three aspects, namely, software fault tolerance, resource control, and backup and recovery. However, further improvements are needed for other aspects, including security audit, access control, identification and authentication, and data integrity. Copyright . Assessment and analysis.

Managing cyber security risks of the cyber-enabled ship. One aspect of the digital transformation process in the shipping industry, a process often referred to as Shipping 4.0, is the increased digitization of on board systems that goes along with increased automation in and autonomy of the vessel. This is happening by integrating Information Technology with Operation Technology systems that results in Cyber Physical Systems on which the safe operations and sailing of contemporary and future vessels depend. Unavoidably, such highly interconnected and interdependent systems increase the exposure of the vessel’s digital infrastructure to cyber attacks and cyber security risks. In this paper, we leverage the STRIDE and DREAD methodologies to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the cyber risk of Cyber Physical Systems on board digitalized contemporary and future ships. Further, we propose appropriate cyber security baseline controls to mitigate such risks, by applying a systematic approach using a set of criteria that take into account the security requirements. the cyber risks. the possible attacks. and the possibly already existing controls, to select from the list of controls provided in the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) overlay of the NIST Guide to ICS Security. The results are expected to support the decision-making and the design of a security architecture for the cyber-enabled ship. Cyber physical systems. Cyber risk assessment.

Dynamic bayesian networks based abnormal event classifier for nuclear power plants in case of cyber security threats. With increased adoption of digital systems for instrumentation and control, nuclear power plants have become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Such attacks can have very serious implications on a plant's operation, especially if they masquerade as safety events. Thus, it is important that research be focused towards distinguishing cyber-attacks from fault induced safety events for a correct response in a timely manner. In this paper, an event classifier is presented to classify abnormal events in nuclear power plants as either fault induced safety events or cyber-attacks. The process of inferring the hidden (unobservable) state of a system (normal or faulty) through observable physical sensor measurements has been a long-standing industry practice. There has been a recent surge of literature discussing the use of network traffic data for the detection of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems. In the classifier we present, both physical and network behaviors of a nuclear power plant during abnormal events (safety events or cyber-attacks) are used to infer the probabilities of the states of the plant. The nature of the abnormal event in question is then determined based on these probabilities. The Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) methodology is used for this purpose since it is an appropriate framework for inferring hidden states of a system from observed variables through probabilistic reasoning. In this paper we introduce a DBN based abnormal event classifier and an architecture to implement this classifier as part of a monitoring system. An experimental environment is setup with a two-tank system in conjunction with a nuclear power plant simulator and a programmable logic controller. A set of 27 cyber-attacks and 14 safety events were systematically designed for the experiment. A set of 6 cyber-attacks and 2 safety events were used to manually finetune the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of the 2-timeslice dynamic Bayesian network (2T-DBN). Out of the remaining 33 events, the nature of the abnormal event was successfully identified in all the 33 cases and the location of the cyber-attack or fault was successfully determined in 32 cases. The case-study demonstrates the applicability of the methodology developed. Further research should examine the practicality of implementing the proposed monitoring system on a real-world system and issues associated with cost optimization. Abnormal events. classification.

Latent groups of cybersecurity preparedness in Europe: Sociodemographic factors and country-level contexts. The increase of people's online presence creates additional cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity preparedness is increasingly important to minimize and mitigate cybersecurity-related victimization. This study explores how cybersecurity preparedness is shaped by socio-structural factors across thirty European samples. We analyzed survey items measuring purchase behavior, user's security settings, software settings, and trust in websites from the 2014 Eurobarometer (N=26,879). The findings of latent class analysis show three groups based on members’ cybersecurity preparedness: uninformed users, disciplined users, and cautious users. The determinants of cybersecurity preparedness were examined using two-level hierarchical logit modeling. While sociodemographic factors modestly contribute to cybersecurity preparedness at an individual level, country-level economic status (GDP per capita) and cybersecurity preparedness (Global Cybersecurity Index) appear to be significant for individual-level cybersecurity preparedness. In countries with higher cybersecurity preparedness and economic status, individuals tend to show a higher level of cybersecurity preparedness. Implications for government agencies and corporations are discussed. Cybersecurity preparedness. Europe. Hierarchical logit modeling. Latent class analysis. 
Survey analysis of computer science, food science, and cybersecurity skills and coursework of undergraduate and graduate students interested in food safety. Automation is coming and will enable not only the ability to increase poultry processing line speeds, but also the collection of considerable big data. These data can be collected en masse, stored, analyzed, and used to improve food safety, quality, enhance traceability, and also be used for risk assessment. However, as this technology is implemented in the poultry industry, computer hackers will emerge to pose a clear and present danger to the poultry industry and the upcoming generation of professionals must be equipped with the knowledge to protect sensitive data. The objective of this study was to quantitate the current computer science (CS) competency, food science exposure and extracurricular activities, and familiarity with cybersecurity topics of students in food science and related fields. Students ranked their CS abilities, 1 through 5, with 1 being the lowest level of competence and 5 representing the highest level of confidence. To assess their knowledge of food safety-related sciences, participants were asked about their familiarity with the respective fields. The average student was familiar with common avenues of food safety exposure, such as television and the Internet. Students were less familiar with more advanced, and arguably important topics, such as botnet. Finally, the students ranked their familiarity with cybersecurity topics, 1 through 5, with 1 representing being not familiar at all and 5 representing extremely familiar. Therefore, to meet the future technological demands, specific course-work is required to improve prospective student CS and cybersecurity competency. computer skills. cybersecurity. food safety. undergraduate students. 
Building cyber security awareness in a developing country: Lessons from Myanmar. The paper discusses the arguments for inclusion of cybersecurity awareness building in development assistance programs. We note that cybersecurity awareness building can strengthen the resilience of productivity-enhancing services, such as mobile banking and e-payment systems, and benefit economic growth. We develop a typology of cybersecurity strategies involving government, the private sector and the international community. The paper describes an Australian-funded program delivered by Monash University to overcome cyber errorism by strengthening cybersecurity capacity and awareness in Myanmar and explains how and why it was delivered. Drawing on the program's experience, the paper identifies various challenges to managing an effective program as well as eight lessons learned which might be applicable to other programs. Key amongst the lessons learned is the need for a solid understanding of how the internet is accessed and used in the host country, and the need for local content to attract target audience attention.

Time pressure in human cybersecurity behavior: Theoretical framework and countermeasures. Cybersecurity is a growing concern for private individuals and professional entities. Reports have shown that the majority of cybersecurity incidents occur because users fail to behave securely. Research on human cybersecurity (HCS) behavior suggests that time pressure is one of the important driving factors behind non-secure HCS behavior. However, there is limited conceptual work to guide researchers and practitioners in this regard. Against this backdrop, we investigate how the impact of time pressure on HCS behavior can be conceptualized within an integrative framework and which countermeasures can be used to reduce its negative impact. Altogether, we conducted 35 interviews with cybersecurity experts, non-security professionals, and private users. The results of our study shed light on the theoretical pathways through which time pressure can affect different types of security behaviors and identify a range of operational, human, technical, and physical countermeasures with important implications for research and practice.

An anomaly detection framework for cyber-security data. Data-driven anomaly detection systems unrivalled potential as complementary defence systems to existing signature-based tools as the number of cyber attacks increases. In this manuscript an anomaly detection system is presented that detects any abnormal deviations from the normal behaviour of an individual device. Device behaviour is defined as the number of network traffic events involving the device of interest observed within a pre-specified time period. The behaviour of each device at normal state is modelled to depend on its observed historic behaviour. A number of statistical and machine learning approaches are explored for modelling this relationship and through a comparative study, the Quantile Regression Forests approach is found to have the best predictive power. Based on the prediction intervals of the Quantile Regression Forests an anomaly detection system is proposed that characterises as abnormal, any observed behaviour outside of these intervals. A series of experiments for contaminating normal device behaviour are presented for examining the performance of the anomaly detection system. Through the conducted analysis the proposed anomaly detection system is found to outperform two other detection systems. The presented work has been conducted on two enterprise networks.

Institutional Isomorphism in Organizational Cybersecurity: A Text Analytics Approach. This research examines how organizational cybersecurity responses become isomorphic over time. Drawing on institutional theory, this study theorizes that mimetic pressures, normative pressures, and coercive pressures impact cybersecurity responses. Using the textual data gathered from the annual 10-K reports published by 87 large organizations and their competitors, topic modeling was employed to assess the cybersecurity responses and institutional pressures. Linear regression was applied to the resultant topic weights. Findings show that mimetic pressures were significant over time while coercive pressures were significant in the near-term and normative pressures were significant in the long-term. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Cybersecurity. institutional pressures. regression. text analytics. topic modeling. 
Historical Consciousness of Cyber Security in India. Cyber security has become crucial to any nation's security, economy, and overall well-being. While much has been written about India's rise as a global computing power, not much is known about its cyber security history. I seek to fill this gap through a comprehensive analysis of India's cyber security history and cyber security consciousness. To do this, I take a very wide view of cyber security - as the totality of security infrastructure that includes all technologies used for information collection, storage, and dissemination. My study also covers a very long period, starting from India's colonial times to the present. The long period of examination helps gain perspective on how India's security stances and security consciousness have evolved with time. Earlier colonial policies kept information and communications technologies (ICTs) strictly under government authority, to be wielded as tools of project power and control. These policies continued even after independence, with successive Indian governments retaining absolute monopoly over ICTs. I divide cyber security into internally-focused (i.e. censorship, surveillance, control of citizens) and externally-focused (i.e. defensive and offensive actions directed at malicious external and internal entities perceived as threats to the nation, its enterprises, and citizens) cyber security. My analysis shows that postindependent India granted its citizens freedom of expression and the freedom to elect and govern, but did not do away with the colonial vestiges of internally-focused control policies using ICTs. Nor has it been entirely successful in stitching together a comprehensive externally-focused cyber security policy, despite increasing threats from the outside. These are increasingly at odds with Indian citizens whose cyber security consciousness has grown and evolved over time. It is clear that the state and the citizens need to continuously and democratically negotiate cyber security, to balancing national security with the citizens' constitutionally protected rights. control and power. cyber law.

Experiencing Cybersecurity One Game at a Time: A Systematic Review of Cybersecurity Digital Games. Background. Cybersecurity is of increasing importance in our interconnected world, yet the field has a growing workforce deficit and an underrepresentation of women and people of color. In an effort to address these issues, many digital games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping themselves, their data, and their networks safe. Intervention. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts. Methods. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity (either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and presentation of cybersecurity were gathered. Results. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer, mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of women and minoritized individuals in the field. Discussion. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening participation goals of the cybersecurity field. cybersecurity. digital game-based learning. digital games. 
Considering the human operator cognitive process for the interpretation of diagnostic outcomes related to component failures and cyber security attacks. In this work, we consider diagnostics of cyber attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), based on data analytics. For the first time to authors knowledge, the performance of such diagnosis is quantified considering the possible failure of the human operator cognitive process in interpreting and understanding the diagnosis support tool outcomes. A Non-Parametric CUmulative SUM (NP-CUSUM) approach is used for data-driven diagnostic, and the cognitive process of the human operator who interprets its outputs is modeled by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The overall framework is applied on the digital controller of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED). Bayesian belief network. Cyber-physical system. Diagnostic.

Integrating IS success model with cybersecurity factors for e-government implementation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The electronic government (E-Gov) systems are currently getting recognized as an authentic strategically tool in delivering E-services. Considering the development of information system (IS) as well as the expanding of the internet-based applications in KSA, E-Gov has always been a significant aspect in delivering governmental services. This research has adopted the (IS) success model by both DeLone and McLean (D&M), moreover, it adopted technology acceptance model (TAM) with cybersecurity factors, both models were implemented to discover the status of the IS success then investigate cybersecurity aspects that impact the service efficiency and effectiveness in KSA. Consequently, this research aims to create a model to investigate the IS success model along with cybersecurity factors that influence E-Gov services effectiveness and usage. Therefore, a survey has been applied as the major data gathering approach. the survey has been distributed among 211 users of E-Gov services consistently. Moreover, all research findings were attained through a quantitative method using the structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings revealed that the constructs fundamental of the (IS) success model are strongly influencing users' satisfaction (US) of the E-Gov services. correspondingly, the fundamental constructs factors of cybersecurity with TAM appear to have a strong impacts on perceived risk (PR), in addition, both which affect the E-Gov services towards usage and effectiveness.

A Risk-Based Dynamic Decision-Making Approach for Cybersecurity Protection in Industrial Control Systems. Decision-making is a key component of industrial control system (ICS) security. However, due to the stability and real-time requirements of ICSs, current decision-making approaches typically designed for IT systems are not entirely suitable for ICSs. In this paper, with consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a risk-based multistep dynamic decision-making approach for protecting ICSs is proposed. Following this proposal, multiple models, including multilayer Bayesian network, process model, and attack-defense strategy model are built first. On this basis, a state controller is designed to ensure the safe degradation/upgradation of ICSs. Finally, a game theory-based optimal defense strategy generation approach is presented. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation on a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the proposed dynamic decision-making approach has the ability to generate the optimal defense strategy to minimize system loss.

Analyzing medical device connectivity and its effect on cyber security in german hospitals. Background: Modern healthcare devices can be connected to computer networks and many western healthcare institutions run those devices in networks. At the same time, cyber attacks are on the rise and there is evidence that cybercriminals do not spare critical infrastructure such as major hospitals, even if they endanger patients. Intuitively, the more and closer connected healthcare devices are to public networks, the higher the risk of getting attacked. Methods: To asses the current connectivity status of healthcare devices, we surveyed the field of German hospitals and especially University Medical Center UMCs. Results: The results show a strong correlation between the networking degree and the number of medical devices. The average number of medical devices is 25.150, with a median of networked medical devices of 3.600. Actual key users of networked medical devices are the departments Radiology, Intensive Care, Radio-Oncology RO, Nuclear Medicine NUC, and Anaesthesiology in the group of UMCs. In the next five years, the usage of networked medical devices will increase significantly in the departments of Surgery, Intensive Care, and Radiology. We detected a strong correlation between the degree of connectivity and the likelihood of being attacked.The survey answers regarding the cyber security status reveal a lack of security basics in some of the inquired hospitals. We did discover successful attacks in hospitals with separated or subsidiary departments. A fusion of competencies on an organizational level facilitates the right behavior here. Most hospitals rated themselves predominantly positively in the self-assessment but also stated the usefulness of IT security insurance. Conclusions: Concluding our results, hospitals are already facing the consequences of omitted measures within their growing pool of medical devices. Continuously relying on historically grown structures without adaption and trusting manufactures to solve vectors is a critical behavior that could seriously endanger patients.

Hybrid and cyber security threats and the EU’s financial system. Increasing cyber and hybrid risks will test the European Union’s system of fragmentation on issues of security, but centralization on financial and other economic issues. This asymmetry was not an obstacle in a world in which security threats were more contained or of a different nature. But the world is changing. In this article, we document the rise in cyber attacks in the EU. Meanwhile, hybrid threats are real, though difficult to quantify. We then explore preparations to increase the resilience of the financial system in terms of regulation, testing, and governance. We find that at the individual institutional level, significant measures have been taken, even though there are diverging views on whether individual companies are sufficiently prepared. More worryingly, preparations appear less advanced at the system-wide level. We recommend that EU finance ministers increase resilience through regular preparedness exercises and greater consideration of system-wide regulatory issues. A broader political discussion on the integration of the EU security architecture applicable to the financial system should also be advanced. This includes reopening the framework on foreign-investment screening in order to have screening of foreign investment in critical financial infrastructure at the EU level. Cyber security.

The impact of information sharing legislation on cybersecurity industry. Purpose: The objective of this paper is to investigate how firms react to cybersecurity information sharing environment where government organizations disseminate cybersecurity threat information gathered by individual firms to the private entities. The overall impact of information sharing on firms' cybersecurity investment decision has only been game-theoretically explored, not giving practical implication. The authors therefore leverage the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA) to observe firms' attitudinal changes toward investing in cybersecurity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors design a quasi-experiment where they set US cybersecurity firms as an experimental group (a proxy for total investment in cybersecurity) and nonsecurity firms as a control group to measure the net effect of CISA on overall cybersecurity investment. To enhance the robustness of the authors’ difference-in-difference estimation, the authors employed propensity score matched sample test and reduced sample test as well. Findings: For the full sample, the authors’ empirical findings suggest that US security firms' overall performance (i.e. Tobin's Q) improved following the legislation, which indicates that more investment in cybersecurity was followed by the formation of information sharing environment. Interestingly, big cybersecurity firms are beneficiaries of the CISA when the full samples are divided into small and large group. Both Tobin's Q and sales growth rate increased for big firms after CISA. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ findings shed more light on the research stream of cybersecurity and information sharing, a research area only explored by game-theoretical approaches. Given that the US government has tried to enforce cybersecurity defensive measures by building cooperative architecture such as CISA 2015, the policy implication of this study is far-reaching. Originality/value: The authors’ study contributes to the research on the economic benefits of sharing cybersecurity information by finding the missing link (i.e. empirical evidence) between sharing and economic impact. This paper confirms that CISA affects the cybersecurity industry unevenly by firm size, a previously unidentified relationship. Cybersecurity industry. Cybersecurity information sharing.

Country-level cybersecurity posture assessment:Study and analysis of practices. Along with positive impacts, ICT transformation also increases the exposure of critical infrastructure to cyber-attacks. Keeping in view the constantly evolving cyber-threat landscape, it is vital for a country to continuously assure the cybersecurity of its ICT infrastructure. Recently the security of the cyberspace has got a much-needed emphasis from Governments and International Agencies. To generate assurance, actions initiated by a country to counter cyber threats need to be continuously assessed for implementation & effectiveness. This study aims to offer a new perspective on country-wide cybersecurity benchmarking and assurance. The paper presents the study and analysis of the methods and practices adopted by countries for cybersecurity posture assessment and generating assurance on the implemented cybersecurity measures. In this paper, the cybersecurity posture assessment and assurance practices implemented by 37 countries are studied with an objective of understanding the global scenario and identification of different methods adopted for a cybersecurity posture assessment. cyber Threat Assessment.

Trade off Cybersecurity Concerns for Co-Created Value. Based upon the service-dominant (S-D) logic and the well-established belief-behavior framework, this study proposes a research model that captures the belief/perception factors and the interactive process driving people to balance and trade-off their cybersecurity concerns for co-created value in social media use. The model was validated with a large set of field survey data of 1,559 Facebook users. For information systems (IS) research, the study represents our attempt in adopting and empirically assessing the S-D Logic in the social media context. We extended the IS privacy calculus literature, and provided a context-specific cognitive/behavioral trade-off view of social media use. For business practice, the study offers managerial guidelines in improving service effectiveness and retaining a critical mass of active social media users for marketing extension, business innovations, and customer relationship management (CRM) in the organizational setting. belief-behavior. co-created value. cybersecurity. service-dominant logic.

Dark Web Traffic Analysis of Cybersecurity Threats Through South African Internet Protocol Address Space. Cybersecurity crimes masterminded at dark web pose social security threats global and open a conundrum for researchers in the field of security informatics. Dark web describes a layer beneath deep web on Internet protocol stack that is designed to be concealed from orthodox search engines. The concealment of orthodox search engines has made it extremely hard for law enforcement agencies to track specific websites that pose great cybersecurity threats. This research was supported financially by the BankSeta, Council on Scientific and Industrial Research and National Research Foundation of South Africa to track the malicious use of dark web through South African Internet protocol address space. The study applies the method of dark web crawling using onion router to track traffic with high tendency for cybersecurity threats. The results of crawling experimental indicate that child pornography, sales of spyware, hacking, sales of drugs, planning of violence and sales of dangerous weapons are the frequent malicious use of dark web in South Africa. The outcome of this study can help in creating an accurate revelation of cybersecurity threats to assist law enforcement agencies to combat cybercriminals in the country. Anonymized network.

Gaps and opportunities in situational awareness for cybersecurity. Demand is present among security practitioners for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), but capability and assessment have not risen to match. SA is an integral component of cybersecurity for everyone from individuals to business to response teams and threat exchanges. In this Field Note, we highlight existing research and our field observations, a recent review of cyber SA research literature, and call upon the research community to help address three research problems in situational awareness for cybersecurity. The gaps suggest the need to (1) understand what cyber SA is from the human operators' perspectives, then (2) measure it so that (3) the community can learn whether SA makes a difference in meaningful ways to cybersecurity, and whether methods, technology, or other solutions would improve SA and thus, improve those outcomes.

COLD ENERGY ECONOMY AND CYBERSECURITY OF FLOATING STORAGE AND REGASIFICATION UNITS: EMERGING TRENDS, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES. Today the world energy market is in great transition and the demand of clean energy such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). Increase of natural gas production and supply causes drawback of onshore infrastructure and many environmental restrictions. As solution, offshore large-scale terminals especially Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) type is becoming commercially competitive and effective alternative for the areas where onshore gas supply infrastructure is not feasible. LNG production consumes around 850 kJ/kg of LNG energy and it is just dumped into seawater or in the atmosphere despite reusing as extra energy source. In this paper, we review the cold energy economy as well as current status of LNG cold energy utilization technologies. Moreover, current and emerging cybersecurity trends after LNG cold energy implementation at FSRU are proposed and discussed to broaden the perspectives of the researchers in the community and industry experts. Finally, the review concluded with a practical recommendation of implementation of LNG Cold Energy Hub concept for future energy systems.. cold energy economy. energy efficiency. FSRU. cybersecurity.

CYBERSECURITY AS AN ELEMENT OF FINANCIAL SECURITY IN THE CONDITIONS OF GLOBALIZATION. The methodological foundations of the formation of analytical support for public administration of cybersecurity have been improved. Based on a combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods using the IBM SPSS Statistics package, the country's regions have been grouped into four clusters, which is the basis for adjusting the priorities of the state cybersecurity policy, a well-grounded approach when choosing means and instruments of influence at the regional level. In modern doctrine and practice of international law, the issues of qualification of cyber warfare remain controversial. There are approaches to justify the application of international humanitarian and criminal law. The most justified, in our opinion, is the qualification of cyber warfare as a violation of the UNO Charter and the use of force, and in some cases - the crime of aggression. The substantive rules of the institution of international cooperation in the fight against cybercrime determine the special principles of this kind of cooperation, the criminalization of certain types of illegal acts, as well as institutional mechanisms and capacity building. The system of international combating cybercrime is based on the principles of technical neutrality, multi-stakeholderism (public-private partnerships), as well as the equivalence of human rights online and offline. In the future, cybercrime will be associated with the use of innovative technologies. As it has been established by the example of the Internet of things, the latest technology, as a general rule, is included in the scope of existing international agreements on cybercrime, but there is no special regulation for them. We propose formal consolidation of the provision on emergent technologies in the texts of international legal acts in the field of combating cybercrime. First of all, this concerns the future UNO Convention on the fight against cybercrime, which should also provide for an additional body, such as the T-CY Committee under the Council of Europe Convention, which will provide clarification on the application of the agreement in specific changed circumstances.. cybercrime. cybersecurity. financial security. information and communication technology.

Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Mobile Fare Payment Applications: A Case Study. Mobile fare payment applications are becoming increasingly common in the public transportation industry as a convenience for customers and as part of an effort to reduce fare management costs and improve operations for agencies. However, there is relatively little literature on vulnerabilities and liabilities in mobile fare payment applications. Furthermore, few public agencies or supporting vendors have policies or established processes in place to receive vulnerability reports or patch vulnerabilities discovered in their technologies. Given the rapidly increasing number of data breaches in general industry IT systems, as well as that mobile fare payment apps are a nexus between customer and agency financial information, the security of these mobile applications deserves further scrutiny. This paper presents a vulnerability discovered in a mobile fare payment application deployed at a transit agency in Florida that, because of the system architecture, may have affected customers in as many as 40 cities across the United States, an estimated 1,554,000 users. Lessons learned from the vulnerability disclosure process followed by the research team as well as recommendations for public agencies seeking to improve the security of these types of applications are also discussed. 
A High Accuracy Method for Individual Assessment and Group Index Construction of Cyber Security Awareness [高准确度网络安全意识个体评估及群体指数构建方法]. To achieve better results in the individual assessment and the group index construction of the cyber security awareness, a high-accurate method was proposed, combining with a set of different techniques. On the first stage, multi-dimension data acquisition and mixture of regression were introduced for the quantification of the security score. And then, gathering the extracted data with the improved label propagation algorithm, the awareness level was obtained based on the customized supervising data, being independent of tagged data. Furthermore, by using the Grubbs criterion to design the calculation function for group security index, to diminish the abnormal points and abstract the common features, the group index was constructed based on the evaluation results of cyber security awareness. Compared with the selected state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed design can achieve a better accuracy and objectivity, and be able to demonstrate the general standard for the group security index. The results provide a effective method for the further study of the cyber security awareness. Cyber security awareness. Grubbs criterion. Label propagation algorithms. Mix of regression. 
Toward a sustainable cybersecurity ecosystem. Cybersecurity issues constitute a key concern of today’s technology-based economies. Cybersecurity has become a core need for providing a sustainable and safe society to online users in cyberspace. Considering the rapid increase of technological implementations, it has turned into a global necessity in the attempt to adapt security countermeasures, whether direct or indirect, and prevent systems from cyberthreats. Identifying, characterizing, and classifying such threats and their sources is required for a sustainable cyber-ecosystem. This paper focuses on the cybersecurity of smart grids and the emerging trends such as using blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT). The cybersecurity of emerging technologies such as smart cities is also discussed. In addition, associated solutions based on artificial intelligence and machine learning frameworks to prevent cyber-risks are also discussed. Our review will serve as a reference for policy-makers from the industry, government, and the cybersecurity research community. Anomaly detection. Blockchain. Cyber-risk assessment. Cybernetics.

Overview of Cyber Security Threats and Defense Technologies for Energy Critical Infrastructure [能源关键基础设施网络安全威胁与防御技术综述]. Energy critical infrastructure has undergone transformative rapid development in the context of the rapid development of information technology, and has been deeply integrated with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and the Internet of Things. While information technology significantly improves the efficiency and performance of energy critical infrastructure, it also brings new types of security threats that are more persistent and covert. An urgent problem is how to establish a systematic and intelligent security defense system for energy critical infrastructure. This paper starts with the development trend of energy critical infrastructure, and analyzes the mechanism of the traditional and new security threat mechanisms it faces. On this basis, insightful analysis on the research status and evolution trends of defense technologies for energy critical infrastructures is made.. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

Assessing DER network cybersecurity defences in a power-communication co-simulation environment. Increasing penetrations of interoperable distributed energy resources (DER) in the electric power system are expanding the power system attack surface. Maloperation or malicious control of DER equipment can now cause substantial disturbances to grid operations. Fortunately, many options exist to defend and limit adversary impact on these newly-created DER communication networks, which typically traverse the public internet. However, implementing these security features will increase communication latency, thereby adversely impacting real-time DER grid support service effectiveness. In this work, a collection of software tools called SCEPTRE was used to create a co-simulation environment where SunSpec-compliant photovoltaic inverters were deployed as virtual machines and interconnected to simulated communication network equipment. Network segmentation, encryption, and moving target defence security features were deployed on the control network to evaluate their influence on cybersecurity metrics and power system performance. The results indicated that adding these security features did not impact DER-based grid control systems but improved the cybersecurity posture of the network when implemented appropriately. 
A new text classification model based on contrastive word embedding for detecting cybersecurity intelligence in twitter. Detecting cybersecurity intelligence (CSI) on social media such as Twitter is crucial because it allows security experts to respond cyber threats in advance. In this paper, we devise a new text classification model based on deep learning to classify CSI-positive and-negative tweets from a collection of tweets. For this, we propose a novel word embedding model, called contrastive word embedding, that enables to maximize the difference between base embedding models. First, we define CSI-positive and-negative corpora, which are used for constructing embedding models. Here, to supplement the imbalance of tweet data sets, we additionally employ the background knowledge for each tweet corpus: (1) CVE data set for CSI-positive corpus and (2) Wikitext data set for CSI-negative corpus. Second, we adopt the deep learning models such as CNN or LSTM to extract adequate feature vectors from the embedding models and integrate the feature vectors into one classifier. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compare our method with two baseline classification models: (1) a model based on a single embedding model constructed with CSI-positive corpus only and (2) another model with CSI-negative corpus only. As a result, we indicate that the proposed model shows high accuracy, i.e., 0.934 of F1-score and 0.935 of area under the curve (AUC), which improves the baseline models by 1.76∼6.74% of F1-score and by 1.64∼6.98% of AUC.

Internet of Things, cybersecurity and governing wicked problems: learning from climate change governance. The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) is central to what the World Economic Forum has coined the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’. a technological revolution built upon cyber-physical systems that will blur the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres. Novel interconnections will emerge as a result, challenging traditional relations and modes of governance. However, a central feature of the IoT is that the implications of cyber (in)security are no longer abstract. The IoT also returns us to the world of kinetic effects in international relations. more familiar territory for IR. The resulting cooperation and coordination challenges are transboundary in nature, occur at multiple levels across sectors, between institutions, and will impact all actors, both public and private, in complex, often highly politicised ways. In this article we argue that advances in global climate governance appear to be offering an early model of a consensual rules-based approach within the existing international order that provides space for advancing agility, flexibility, and polycentrism to meet the demands of ‘wicked problems’ like the cybersecurity of the IoT. Perhaps one of the most important lessons to be drawn across from climate governance is the role of robust mechanisms for knowledge exchange – specifically between the technical and policy communities. climate change. cybersecurity. digital technology. governance.

A Cybersecurity Insurance Model for Power System Reliability Considering Optimal Defense Resource Allocation. With the increasing application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), cyberattacks have become more prevalent against Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) such as the modern power grids. Various methods have been proposed to model the cybersecurity threats, but so far limited studies have been focused on the defensive strategies subject to the limited security budget. In this paper, the power supply reliability is evaluated considering the strategic allocation of defense resources. Specifically, the optimal mixed strategies are formulated by the Stackelberg Security Game (SSG) to allocate the defense resources on multiple targets subject to cyberattacks. The cyberattacks against the intrusion-tolerant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system are mathematically modeled by Semi-Markov Process (SMP) kernel. The intrusion tolerance capability of the SCADA system provides buffered residence time before the substation failure to enhance the network robustness against cyberattacks. Case studies of the cyberattack scenarios are carried out to demonstrate the intrusion tolerance capability. Depending on the defense resource allocation scheme, the intrusion-tolerant SCADA system possesses varying degrees of self-healing capability to restore to the good state and prevent the substations from failure. If more defense resources are invested on the substations, the intrusion tolerant capability can be further enhanced for protecting the substations. Finally, the actuarial insurance principle is designed to estimate transmission companies' individual premiums considering correlated cybersecurity risks. The proposed insurance premium principle is designed to provide incentive for investments on enhancing the intrusion tolerance capability, which is verified by the results of case studies. cyber risk management. cyber-insurance.

CYBERSECURITY: THE ENDGAME–PART ONE. As companies —board members, senior management, risk and information technology managers - strive to grow while strengthening reputation, minimizing security incidents, preparing for and responding to them. they often find themselves struggling with the cybersecurity approaches they thought would help. Unlike Avengers and Captain Marvel, a losing endgame. As cyber threats and attacks become more sophisticated. this article first explains how daily struggles cannot be fixed just by better implementation. Why? Because so many struggles are caused by structural, not implementation, flaws. Thus, structural flaws must be fixed. Second, it points to a better endgame–using proven business management methods to simplify complexity and improve outcomes, especially Total Quality Management and innovation initiatives. Third, because change is challenging, the article offers backstories, tips and engaging questions to make it easier for leaders to manage daily operations amidst shifting priorities while fostering transformation in the spirit of innovation. 
Public companies' cybersecurity risk disclosures. Though cybersecurity risks are significant and could materially affect business operations and the integrity of financial reporting, there is limited empirical research on the cybersecurity risk disclosure trends and practices of public companies. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal study of the content and linguistic characteristics of public companies' cybersecurity risk disclosure practices as well as factors that may drive disclosure trends. The results show that the two most commonly disclosed cybersecurity risks are risks of service/operation disruption and risks of data breach. Item 1A of the 10-K Report is the most commonly used disclosure location, but some companies also use Items 1 and 7 to disclose regulation risks and cyber incidents, respectively. The length of cybersecurity risk disclosures increases linearly during the period of our study. This increase is associated with the issuance of SEC guidance (2011 and 2018), industry, overall cybersecurity risks in the general environment, company size, and prior cybersecurity breach incidents. Disclosures have also become more difficult to read in general. They are more difficult to read as firm size increases and are easier to read as the proportion of intangible assets increases or after an executive change. Firms have increased their usage of litigious words in their disclosures. Bigger firms, on average, tend to use less litigious language, but companies in industries with high business information technology intensity (e.g., consumer services, software and services, and banking) tend to use more litigious language than other companies.

Model-Free Data Authentication for Cyber Security in Power Systems. With the development and wide deployment of measurement equipment, data can be automatically measured and visualized for situation awareness in power systems. However, the cyber security of power systems is also threated by data spoofing attacks. This letter proposed a measurement data source authentication (MDSA) algorithm based on feature extraction techniques including ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and fast Fourier transform (FFT), and machine learning for real-time measurement data classification. Compared with previous work, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher accuracy of MDSA using a shorter window of data from closely located synchrophasor measurement sensors. back propagation (BP) network.

Passive- and not active-risk tendencies predict cyber security behavior. Vulnerabilities to online cyber-related crime are typically the result of poor decisions on the part of users. To date, research on risk-taking behavior applied to cyber-security situations has concentrated mainly on the risks that stem from active behavioral choices (e.g., opening an attachment from an unknown sender). However, risk may result from the failure to implement an action (e.g., not strengthening a password). These two types of risk have been differentiated and termed active- and passive-risk behaviors. We conducted two studies (Study 1 and Study 2) that examine how self-reported active- and passive-risk behaviors predict cyber-security behavioral intentions. In Study 3, we examine how active and passive risk relate to actual cyber-security behavior. The results show that cyber-security behavioral intentions and actual cyber behaviors are significantly correlated with self-reported individual differences in passive-risk behavior but not in active-risk behavior. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. Cyber intentions. Cyber security. Passive risk. Risk behavior. Security. 
Cybersecurity vulnerability management: A conceptual ontology and cyber intelligence alert system. Effective vulnerability management requires the integration of vulnerability information available on multiple sources, including social media. The information could be used to inform common users about impending vulnerabilities and countermeasures. First, we present the Cybersecurity Vulnerability Ontology (CVO), a conceptual model for formal knowledge representation of the vulnerability management domain. Second, we utilize the CVO to design a Cyber Intelligence Alert (CIA) system that issues cyber alerts about vulnerabilities and countermeasures. We rigorously evaluated the CVO as well as the accuracy, performance, and usefulness of the CIA system. Key contributions of this study to research and practice are discussed. Conceptual modeling.

Internet banking in Nigeria: Cyber security breaches, practices and capability. This paper reports the findings from a research project on cyber security in the Nigerian Internet banking industry, by presenting the main cyber security breaches it has experienced, along with its cyber security capability and practices. An online survey was conducted with 100 experienced professional working in both the Nigerian banking and banking security service sectors. Our findings reveal a transformation of the Nigerian cybercrime industry from low-tech cyber-enabled crimes to high-tech sophisticated breaches, with viruses, worms or Trojan infections. electronic spam mails. and hacking being the top three most experienced breaches. In term of cyber security practices, banking professionals have received adequate management in both support and training. The lack of advanced technologies to prevent and address cyber security breaches and the unsatisfactory level of legislative compliance, together, appear to be the primary factors that have reduced cyber security capability in our sample of banks.

A Risk Analysis Framework for Cyber Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection of the U.S. Electric Power Grid. The purpose of this article is to introduce a risk analysis framework to enhance the cyber security of and to protect the critical infrastructure of the electric power grid of the United States. Building on the fundamental questions of risk assessment and management, this framework aims to advance the current risk analysis discussions pertaining to the electric power grid. Most of the previous risk-related studies on the electric power grid focus mainly on the recovery of the network from hurricanes and other natural disasters. In contrast, a disproportionately small number of studies explicitly investigate the vulnerability of the electric power grid to cyber-attack scenarios, and how they could be prevented or mitigated. Such a limited approach leaves the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both state-sponsored and lone wolf) to infiltrate a network that lacks a comprehensive security environment or coordinated government response. By conducting a review of the literature and presenting a risk-based framework, this article underscores the need for a coordinated U.S. cyber security effort toward formulating strategies and responses conducive to protecting the nation against attacks on the electric power grid.

Optimal Decision Making Approach for Cyber Security Defense Using Evolutionary Game. At present, there are many techniques for cyber security defense such as firewall, intrusion detection and cryptography. Despite decades of studies and experiences on this issue, there still exists a problem that we always pay great attention to technology while overlooking strategy. In the traditional warfare, the level of decision-making and the formulation of optimal strategies have a great effect on the warfare result. Similarly, the timeliness and quality of decision-making in cyber attack-defense also make great significance. Since the attackers and defenders are oppositional, the selection of optimal defense strategy with the maximum payoff is difficult. To solve this problem, the stochastic evolutionary game model is utilized to simulate the dynamic adversary of cyber attack-defense. We add the parameter \lambda to the Logit Quantal Response Dynamics (LQRD) equation to quantify the cognitive differences of real-world players. By calculating the evolutionary stable equilibrium, the best decision-making approach is proposed, which makes a balance between defense cost and benefit. Cases studies on ransomware indicate that the proposed approach can help the defender predict possible attack action, select the related optimal defense strategy over time, and gain the maximum defense payoff. attack-defense.

Cultivating cybersecurity learning: An integration of self-determination and flow. Because there is a critical shortage of cybersecurity talent, information security professionals and researchers should cultivate cybersecurity skills by encouraging individuals to pursue cybersecurity learning. However, some aspects of cybersecurity require substantial effort and perseverance for conceptual understanding to be gained. We propose motivation as the key to ensuring continuous engagement with and successful learning of such cybersecurity concepts. With a lab-based training program that taught participants about SQL injection attacks, we tested a research model that integrated flow theory and self-determination theory. Within the training program, we captured participants’ persistence in attempting and successfully completing the training exercises while also measuring their perceptions of motivation and flow. We found that flow facilitated motivation and its key antecedents. Flow and task significance had the strongest effects on motivation, while motivation fostered learning persistence and performance. We recommend training programs that maximize flow and task significance. Cybersecurity learning. Cygotobersecurity talent. Flow theory. Motivation. Self determination theory. Survey. 
Assessing data cybersecurity using ISO/IEC 25012. Data is of ever-growing importance and is widely considered to be a company’s most valuable asset. Since data is becoming the main driver of business value, data quality and, specifically, data security are of paramount importance to companies. Various regulations related to data cybersecurity have been drawn up, such as the GDPR and the Cybersecurity Act, thus proving the importance placed on data cybersecurity by influential legislative institutions. Several standards related to security have emerged in recent years, most notably those of the ISO/IEC 27000 series. They are, however, focused on management systems and security infrastructure and ignore the security of the data itself. Other standards related to data quality, such as ISO 8000, also fail to address data security in depth. This paper, therefore, proposes a framework for the evaluation of data cybersecurity, consisting of a quality model, an evaluation process, and a tool for the visualization of the assessment results. This evaluation framework has been employed as the basis for a data cybersecurity certification scheme, which complements other certifiable standards related to data and security, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 8000. This work additionally presents the results of a pilot project in which the data cybersecurity of a commercial product was evaluated. The results of this pilot application allowed us to validate the feasibility of the evaluation framework defined. Data certification. Data cybersecurity. Data evaluation. GDPR. ISO/IEC 25012. 
European strategy and legislation for cybersecurity: implications for Portugal. Cyber-attacks can be more dangerous than guns and tanks. This statement was made by Junker in his speech in the EU State of the Union in 2017 and reflects the extreme importance of this phenomenon. The increasing variety of devices that can access to Internet has contributed to the overall growth of internet users, in all kinds of places and circumstances. These devices are now part of our lives and we use it for everything. As the number of devices and tasks that we do with it are growing, more prone we are to cyber-attacks. As well, as the number of user’s victim of these attacks are increasing, the general concerns about cybercrime are growing too. The growing list of cybercrimes includes crimes that have been made possible by computers, such as network intrusions and the dissemination of computer viruses, as well as computer-based variations of existing crimes, such as identity theft and terrorism which have become as major problem to people and nations. In this context, the European Union is leading the effort to regulate the defence against cyber-threats in both normative/legal and strategic levels. This reality is also very present in Portugal, where there is a sense of lack of control and capacity to combat this kind of threats. In this article, we present the European Strategy and Legislation for Cybersecurity and how this strategy applies and involves Portugal. Cyber extortion. Cyber-attacks. Cyber-threats. Cybercrime.

AVARCIBER: a framework for assessing cybersecurity risks. The identification and assessment of risks are a fundamental part of cybersecurity. Determining the elements that participate in this field is difficult because there is no exclusive approach to cybersecurity. This document aims to provide a framework to identify and assess cybersecurity risks. For this, a systematic review of the studies related to cybersecurity risk taxonomies was carried out. The main elements of the proposed conceptual model and framework have been determined by applying the snowball technique. To validate the implementation of the proposed framework, a case study has been implemented at the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute. The first task was to consolidate the information in a baseline. Once the baseline was obtained, the defined framework has been applied. As a result, through the use of the proposed framework, the assessment process has improved the decision-making process regarding the importance and criticality of the risks and countermeasures that must be applied.

Assessing blockchain potential for improving the cybersecurity of financial transactions. Purpose: Blockchain holds promise as a potential solution to the problem of cybersecurity in financial transactions. However, difficulty exists for both the industry and organizations in assessing this potential solution. Hence, it is important to understand how organizations in the financial sector can address these concerns by exploring blockchain implementation for financial transactions in the context of cybersecurity. To do this, the problem question is threefold: first, what objectives are important based on the strategic values of an organization for evaluating cybersecurity to improve the security of financial transactions? Second, how can they be used to ensure the cybersecurity of financial transactions in a financial organization? Third, how can these objectives be used to evaluate blockchain as a potential solution for enhancing the cybersecurity of organizations in the financial sector relative to existing cybersecurity methods? The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish this goal we utilize Keeney’s (1992) multi-objective decision analytics technique, termed value-focused thinking (VFT), to demonstrate how organizations can assess a blockchain solution’s value to maximize value-add within financial organization. Findings: The presented model clearly demonstrates the viability of using Keeney’s (1992) VFT technique as a multi-criteria decision analysis tool for assessing blockchain technology. Further, a clear explanation of how this model can be extended and adapted for individual organizational use is provided. Originality/value: This paper engages both the academic literature as well as an expert panel to develop an assessment model for blockchain technology related to financial transactions by providing a useful method for structuring the decision-making process of organizations around blockchain technology.

Optimum spending on cybersecurity measures. Purpose: This purpose of this paper is to provide insight through analysis of the data collected from a pilot study, into the decision-making process used by organizations in cybersecurity investments. Leveraging the review of literature, this paper aims to explore the strategic decisions made by organizations when implementing cybersecurity controls, and identifies economic models and theories from the economics of information security, and information security investment decision-making process. Using a survey study method, this paper explores the feasibility for development of a strategic decision-making framework that may be used when evaluating and implementing cybersecurity measures. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the ways in which decisions are made as it relates to cybersecurity spending. The purpose of the pilot study was to determine the feasibility for developing a strategic framework to minimize cybersecurity risks. Phase 1 – Interview Study: The qualitative approach focused on seven participants who provided input to refine the survey study questionnaire. Phase 2 – Survey Study: The qualitative approach focused on information gathered through an online descriptive survey study using a five-point Likert scale. Findings: The literature review identified that there is limited research in the area of information security decision making. One paper was identified within this area, focusing on the research completed by Dor and Elovici [22]. This exploratory research demonstrates that although organizations have actively implemented cybersecurity frameworks, there is a need to enhance the decision-making process to reduce the number and type of breaches, along with strengthening the cybersecurity framework to facilitate a preventative approach. Research limitations/implications: The partnership research design could be expanded to facilitate quantitative and qualitative techniques in parallel with equal weight, leveraging qualitative techniques, an interview study, case study and grounded theory. In-depth data collection and analysis can be completed to facilitate a broader data collection which will provide a representative sample and achieve saturation to ensure that adequate and quality data are collected to support the study. Quantitative analysis through statistical techniques (i.e. regression analysis) taking into account, the effectiveness of cybersecurity frameworks, and the effectiveness of decisions made by stakeholders on implementing cybersecurity measures. Practical implications: This exploratory research demonstrates that organizations have actively implemented cybersecurity measure. however, there is a need to reduce the number and type of breaches, along with strengthening the cybersecurity framework to facilitate a preventative approach. In addition, factors that are used by an organization when investing in cybersecurity controls are heavily focused on compliance with government and industry regulations along with opportunity cost. Lastly, the decision-making process used when evaluating, implementing and investing in cybersecurity controls is weighted towards the technology organization and, therefore, may be biased based on competing priorities. Social implications: The outcome of this study provides greater insight into how an organization makes decisions when implementing cybersecurity controls. This exploratory research shows that most organizations are diligently implementing security measures to effectively monitor and detect cyber security attacks. The pilot study revealed that the importance given to the decisions made by the CIO and Head of the Business Line have similar priorities with regard to funding the investment cost, implementing information security measures and reviewing the risk appetite statement. This parallel decision-making process may potentially have an adverse impact on the decision to fund cybersecurity measures, especially in circumstances where the viewpoints are vastly different . Originality/value: Cybersecurity spend is discussed across the literature, and various approaches, methodologies and models are used. The aim of this paper is to explore the strategic decision-making approach that is used by organizations when evaluating and implementing cybersecurity measures. Using a survey study method, this paper explores the feasibility for development of a strategic decision-making framework that may be used when evaluating and implementing cybersecurity measures.

Cyber security and the disaster resilience framework. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to concentrate on the place of cyber security risk in the framework of global commitments adopted in 2015 to reduce disaster risks in an all-hazards approach. It explores the correlations between traditional risks associated with critical infrastructures – as understood by the Sendai framework – cyber security risks and the cascading effects characteristic of today’s complex and interrelated shocks and stresses. It takes a step further, expanding the focus of traditionally understood technological risks to explore cyber security risks, at the heart of our societies’ digital transformations,and showcase opportunities from the European context. Design/methodology/approach: By reviewing existing literature on cyber security, disaster resilience and cascading disasters, this paper highlights current challenges and good practices undertaken by various governments. Findings: Understanding disaster risks is a precondition to improving the mitigation of impacts of existing risks and preventing new risks. Effective risk reduction relies on a solid understanding of losses resulting from events to inform future actions, and on the assessment of risks relying on a robust evidence base and state-of-the-art scientific capacity to model and simulate potential hazards. In this context, embedding cyber security risks, and the complexity of cascading impacts in improving the understanding of disaster risks, calls for appropriate methods and tools allowing for a multi-risk and holistic focus to the assessment of risks and the planning of risk management capacities that follow. Research limitations/implications: Globally and in Europe, focus on interconnected risk and their impacts is steadily increasing. Risk assessments are still conservative. incorporation of cyber resilience into national and local level DRR plans is yet not visible. Originality/value: Existing research is restricted to cyber security and disaster resilience, as separated subjects. This paper, for the first time, brings together the interconnection between the two topic options to address them. Capability. Climate change. Cyber security. Disaster risk reduction. Governance. Resilience. Sendai framework. 
Cyber security disaster management for power sector. Cyber Attack-Power Sector, a critical electrical infrastructure in India, is at risk due to increasing cyber incidences that may impact normal operations. The electrical infrastructure depends on electronic control systems for its operation which are Cyber physical IT system. Due to this Power System become prone to Cyber-attacks as in case of IT systems. Since any damage to cyber physical system always cause loss of time and money, Cyber Security of Power System is critical. Cyber-attacks are increasing threats to the control systems used in the critical infrastructures in the world today. Cyber threats to system can take many forms e.g. failure of a system/ element to act/ react in designed way due to virus, software bugs, intrusion and congestion in the underlying/ supervising system and it may lead the misguidance to the operating engineers and there by taking false decision in real time operation. Dependence of normal system operation on ICT is such that Operators/ Power System personnel are unaware and not well versed in alternate methods to control/ operate the system. Non availability of ICT systems is also a form of Cyber Security vulnerability. While it is not possible to protect or eliminate the vulnerability of all critical infrastructure, the strategic improvements in security can make it more difficult for attacks to succeed and can lessen the impact of attacks that may occur. Cyber intrusions are costly to Power Sector and many could be prevented by adopting safe design Cyber Security Standards. The impact of cyber vulnerabilities is proportional to the criticality of the functions and systems being impacted. The Cyber security vulnerabilities in Generation Sector are localized and its impact can shut down one unit or plant. The effect of vulnerabilities in centralized systems e.g. SCADA/Automation etc. used in Transmission & Distribution sector is wider and has potential impact on the synchronous operation of entire Power System, leading to Grid collapse. As far as Distribution sector is concerned where bulk of Smart Grid activities are visible, the impact of compromise of a centralized SCADA / DMS can lead to disruption of services to critical customers like Hospitals, Metro Rail etc. which is critical for the units/Services involved but at the same time not global and widespread. Smart Grids is gradually changing the institutional map of the Power Sector creating a new ecosystem of players extending well beyond today’s network of system operators, distributors/ retailer and end-users. However, opening the electricity system to third party innovation will require dealing with new issues such as Interoperability, Cyber-security, Big Data and consumer privacy. Smart Grid is more and more dependent on IoT systems and automated operation of Grid elements including consumer centric decision. With the advent of Smart Grid applications, the cyber space in the Power Sector has increased and so have the Cyber Security vulnerabilities. Increasing number of entry points and paths are available for potential adversaries/hackers. An attack on Smart meters and Smart appliances may lead to commercial loss apart from breach of privacy to individual consumers at Distribution level. The paper details the Cyber threats to the Power Networks & prevention techniques for system technology involving IoT sensor nodes, bidirectional communication protocols, cloud architecture and predictive data analytics. 
A role for embedded instrumentation in real-time hardware assurance and online monitoring against cybersecurity threats. A 2019 AUTOTESTCON paper ] introduced the concept of hardware assurance for security and trust that focused on Trojan payloads and triggers and the use of embedded instruments and data collection from those instruments as one of the detection strategies. A Phase I Small Business Innovation Research grant funded the proof of concept of using a COTS board as a sandboxed emulation environment to safely study the attack scenarios associated with various Trojan attacks, and that effort is described in this article. The e different fundamental Trojan attacks, when coupled with stealth assumptions, require different types of instruments for detection. The best detection method is to place embedded instruments within the semiconductor device that can monitor activity and circuit behavior and can identify when suspect anomalous behavior occurs.. 
5G networks, (cyber)security harmonisation and the internal market: The limits of article 114 TFEU. The European electronic communications market is preparing for the large-scale roll-out of 5G broadband networks, which is expected to revolutionise communications in the EU economy and in European societies. The introduction of 5G technology in Europe can build on an existing framework of electronic communications legislation which were adopted in the internal market harmonisation competences regulated in the legal base provided in art.114 TFEU. However, as revealed by the EU's policy documents, 5G technology, as well as its suppliers, represent considerable internal security risks and pose a threat to Europe's technological sovereignty and autonomy. The EU reacted to these challenges by securitising and politicising its 5G policy. These developments question whether its implementation can take place in internal market competences, and whether the EU alone possesses sufficient competences to secure implementation. 
Machine learning-based detection for cyber security attacks on connected and autonomous vehicles. Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV)-related initiatives have become some of the fastest expanding in recent years, and have started to affect the daily lives of people. More and more companies and research organizations have announced their initiatives, and some have started CAV road trials. Governments around the world have also introduced policies to support and accelerate the deployments of CAVs. Along these, issues such as CAV cyber security have become predominant, forming an essential part of the complications of CAV deployment. There is, however, no universally agreed upon or recognized framework for CAV cyber security. In this paper, following the UK CAV cyber security principles, we propose a UML (Unified Modeling Language)-based CAV cyber security framework, and based on which we classify the potential vulnerabilities of CAV systems. With this framework, a new CAV communication cyber-attack data set (named CAV-KDD) is generated based on the widely tested benchmark data set KDD99. This data set focuses on the communication-based CAV cyber-attacks. Two classification models are developed, using two machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, based on the CAV-KDD training data set. The accuracy, precision and runtime of these two models when identifying each type of communication-based attacks are compared and analysed. It is found that the Decision Tree model requires a shorter runtime, and is more appropriate for CAV communication attack detection. Connected and Autonomous Vehicle. Cyber security.

Use case based blended teaching of IIoT cybersecurity in the industry 4.0 era. Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are paradigms that are driving current industrial revolution by connecting to the Internet industrial machinery, management tools or products so as to control and gather data about them. The problem is that many IIoT/Industry 4.0 devices have been connected to the Internet without considering the implementation of proper security measures, thus existing many examples of misconfigured or weakly protected devices. Securing such systems requires very specific skills, which, unfortunately, are not taught extensively in engineering schools. This article details how Industry 4.0 and IIoT cybersecurity can be learned through practical use cases, making use of a methodology that allows for carrying out audits to students that have no previous experience in IIoT or industrial cybersecurity. The described teaching approach is blended and has been imparted at the University of A Coruna (Spain) during the last years, even during the first semester of 2020, when the university was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Such an approach is supported by online tools like Shodan, which ease the detection of vulnerable IIoT devices. The feedback results provided by the students show that they consider useful the proposed methodology, which allowed them to find that 13% of the IIoT/Industry 4.0 systems they analyzed could be accessed really easily. In addition, the obtained teaching results indicate that the established course learning outcomes are accomplished. Therefore, this article provides useful guidelines for teaching industrial cybersecurity and thus train the next generation of security researchers and developers. Blended teaching. Cybersecurity.

Modern aspects of cyber-security training and continuous adaptation of programmes to trainees. Nowadays, more-and-more cyber-security training is emerging as an essential process for the lifelong personnel education in organizations, especially for those which operate critical infrastructures. This is due to security breaches on popular services that become publicly known and raise people's security awareness. Except from large organizations, small-to-medium enterprises and individuals need to keep their knowledge on the related topics up-to-date as a means to protect their business operation or to obtain professional skills. Therefore, the potential target-group may range from simple users, who require basic knowledge on the current threat landscape and how to operate the related defense mechanisms, to security experts, who require hands-on experience in responding to security incidents. This high diversity makes training and certification quite a challenging task. This study combines pedagogical practices and cyber-security modelling in an attempt to support dynamically adaptive training procedures. The training programme is initially tailored to the trainee's needs, promoting the continuous adaptation to his/her performance afterwards. As the trainee accomplishes the basic evaluation tasks, the assessment starts involving more advanced features that demand a higher level of understanding. The overall method is integrated in a modern cyber-ranges platform, and a pilot training programme for smart shipping employees is presented. Bloom. Computers in education. Cyber-ranges.

Home working and cyber security – an outbreak of unpreparedness?. Home working has been one of the long-promised freedoms of information technology. But until recently it was something that relatively few people had routinely experienced in practice (aside, perhaps, from taking work home to do in the evenings and at weekends). This situation abruptly changed in early 2020, with the Covid-19 pandemic forcing organisations to shut their doors and send staff home. Across the globe, home working wherever possible became the standard advice, and technology was the fundamental enabler of the change. That has changed. With the Covid-19 pandemic, home working became the standard advice, and technology was the fundamental enabler. Steven Furnell of the University of Nottingham and Jayesh Navin Shah of Ipsos MORI examine the extent to which organisations and their staff were prepared for the unplanned outbreak of home working, along with the increased cyberthreats that came with it. 
On modern threats to environmental sustainability in the Arctic: The cybersecurity factor and the provisions of insurance against environmental and cyber risks in oil and gas installations. Due to unprecedented fires and rise in temperature climate change is occurring rapidly, melting the Arctic ice and uncovering new areas for expropriation of natural resources. Such expropriation needs to occur in a sustainable way, respecting the environment and the indi-genous people. To achieve this, all inherent risks arising from any environmental threat (oil spill/any type of environmental accident, cyber risks of any nature) to oil and gas installations need be identified and environmental liability and cyber-risks insurance coverage need be in place. This article discusses the way for such insurance coverage to be placed and worded. It argues that the traditional (marine and other) property insurance policies coverage and wording is inefficient, as it ends up being fragmented due to the numerous policy exclusions and limitations. it also puts forward an argument for the need to have specific wording and cover for specialized risks, in relation to the operation of oil and gas installations in the Arctic and cyber-risk threats, taking into account potential environmental impacts and hazards. This article also argues that for the time being, as busi-nesses and governments including those of the EU and the Member States become increasingly reliant on tech-nology, it is imperative that additional cyber-related risks are identified and minimized or transferred externally. Finally, it offers some suggestions about cybersecurity policies covering specialized risks. Arctic. Cybersecurity. Environmental pollution. Environmental pollution liability. Offshore oil and gas.

The trade: (cyber)security dilemma and its impact on global cybersecurity governance. Governments are adopting various measures to address cybersecurity-related concerns. Some of these measures restrict cross-border flows of digital services/data, and thus inconsistent with obligations in trade agreements such as General Agreement on Trade in Services (‘GATS’). However, certain governments might argue that such measures are justified under the GATS security exception (Art. XIVbis) as they protect national security. This article investigates whether GATS Art. XIVbis is relevant in justifying cybersecurity measures and its potential impact on cybersecurity governance. It argues that GATS Art. XIVbis has limited relevance, and is potentially problematic, when used in justifying majority of cybersecurity measures. First, a large majority of cybersecurity measures do not fall within the limited set of exceptional circumstances listed in GATS Art. XIVbis. Further, in applying this exception to cybersecurity measures, WTO Panels will be unfairly forced to balance trade and security interests in an environment of political, technological and policy uncertainty. Given these practical limitations and the normative boundaries of GATS Art. XIVbis, countries must avoid casually relying upon security exceptions as a basis for adopting/implementing unilateral measures on cybersecurity, but rather engage in meaningful cyber-diplomacy and regulatory cooperation mechanisms to resolve their differences on cybersecurity governance.

The Case against Commercial Antivirus Software: Risk Homeostasis and Information Problems in Cybersecurity. New cybersecurity technologies, such as commercial antivirus software (AV), sometimes fail to deliver on their promised benefits. This article develops and tests a revised version of risk homeostasis theory, which suggests that new cybersecurity technologies can sometimes have ill effects on security outcomes in the short run and little-to-no effect over the long run. It tests the preliminary plausibility of four predictions from the revised risk homeostasis theory using new survey data from 1,072 respondents. The estimations suggest the plausible operation of a number of risk homeostasis dynamics: (1) commercial AV users are significantly more likely to self-report a cybersecurity event in the past year than nonusers, even after correcting for potential reverse causality and informational mechanisms. (2) nonusers become somewhat less likely to self-report a cybersecurity event as the perceived riskiness of various e-mail-based behaviors increases, while commercial AV users do not. (3) the negative short-run effect of commercial AV use on cybersecurity outcomes fade over time at a predicted rate of about 7.03 percentage points per year of use. and (4) after five years of use, commercial AV users are statistically indistinguishable from nonusers in terms of their probability of self-reporting a cybersecurity event as perceptions of risky e-mail-based behaviors increase.

Automatic cyber security risk assessment based on fuzzy fractional ordinary differential equations. Real-time network security risk detection is of great significance to the research of dynamic network security, and it is one of the current research hotspots of network security. Based on the idea of artificial immune, a dynamic network intrusion detection and prediction model based on fuzzy fractional ordinary differential equations is proposed. The uniqueness of the solution is studied in the square integrable equation space using the principle of compression operator, and then the second type of solution is proposed. The differential-type piecewise Taylor series expansion method of the linear Fredholm integral equation is used to obtain the approximate solution expressions and perform convergence and error estimation. The process of network attack detection, antibody concentration calculation method and risk prediction process based on time series autoregressive moving average model are given. The experimental results show that the model can quantitatively analyze the current security situation of the network in real time and make predictions about the risks faced by the network. The prediction effect of catastrophe network risk is better than the GM (1, 1) model, and it is close to the actual risk situation, with high prediction accuracy. Dynamic network intrusion detection.

Cybersecurity threats in the auto industry: Tensions in the knowledge environment. The automotive industry is undergoing probably the most far-reaching changes that have ever affected it. The outward manifestations of change are the emergence of the connected vehicle as the norm rather than the province of up-market cars competing on the presence of innovative ICT-driven features, the race to develop fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the switch to more environmentally sustainable alternative fuel vehicles. The main enabler of these fundamental developments is technological change. But technology is also a driver of change, this is nowhere more obvious than in the application of ICTs in the transport arena. But technological changes of this magnitude also lead to changes in industry structure, a shift in the basis of competition from features and performance to functionalities, and a growing reliance on knowledge that is new to the traditional industry. This paper addresses one aspect of this milieu of developments, that is the emergence of cybersecurity threats to the modern highly-computerised vehicle. Countering such problems requires a high degree of knowledge sharing in the industry and particularly between car manufacturers and their supply networks. This article collects, synthesises and analyses some primary evidence from cybersecurity experts in the industry. The overall conclusion reached is that, in the view of auto-cybersecurity specialists, the level of knowledge-sharing is inadequate. The article presents a number of potential explanations for this phenomenon. the common feature of these explanations is the existence of significant tensions and lack of trust in the knowledge environment.

Cybersecurity Challenges for PACS and Medical Imaging. Cybersecurity issues have been on the rise for years, increasingly affecting the healthcare sector. In 2019, several attacks have been published that specifically aim at medical network protocols and file formats, in particular digital imaging and communications in medicine. This article describes five attack scenarios on picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) and medical imaging networks: the import of patient data from storage media containing malware, a compromise of the hospital network, malware embedded in digital imaging and communications in medicine images or reports, a malicious manipulation of medical images and a network infiltration of malicious health level seven messages. Prevention and mitigation measures for each of these attacks exist, some of which can be implemented by the system user (e.g., hospital), while others require implementation in the PACS and medical imaging devices by the vendors. In practice, however, many of these are not in common use. What is missing today are PACS network security guidelines for practitioners that support users in keeping their network secure. Furthermore, integrating the healthcare enterprise integration profiles and test tools might be needed to address the deployment of public key infrastructure and digital signatures in the PACS environment.

Validation of a socio-technical management process for optimising cybersecurity practices. This study developed a socio-technical management process to optimise both technical and non-technical security measures to provide optimal, rather than adequate, enterprise security safeguards. The rationale was that over the last decade, studies have consistently shown that the human being remains the weakest link in the entire enterprise security chain. As a result, the majority of cyberattacks have resulted from human behaviour or error. Despite this, evidence suggests that many enterprises are still taking overly technocentric approaches to cybersecurity risk and this has increased the chances of missing the bigger picture. Thus, a mechanism to optimise both technical and non-technical security measures by identifying and closing socio-technical security gaps in existing enterprise security frameworks was required. The mechanism was derived from the literature and validated by industry practitioners where it was found that practitioners could categorise security controls into social (human included), technical and environmental dimensions. Through this, it was found that there were mainly non-technical (social and environmental dimensions) security gaps at practitioners’ organisations. To further demonstrate how this security challenge can be identified and addressed, a desktop application of the management process was carried out on the COBIT 5 for Information Security framework. The results reveal the non-technical security gaps on COBIT 5 and the management process demonstrates how these could be closed and optimised. The importance of this study is to highlight that taking overly technocentric approaches to enterprise security risk does not yield significantly positive results in protecting assets. A new approach is required and the socio-technical management process is this paper's contribution to address that security challenge. Cybersecurity. Information security. Optimisation.

Riskio: A Serious Game for Cyber Security Awareness and Education. Cyber attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, causing organisations to continuously adapt management strategies for cyber security risks. As a key risk mitigation policy, organisations are investing in professional training courses for their employees to raise awareness on cyber attacks and related defences. Serious games have emerged as a new approach that can complement instruction-led or computer-based security training by providing a fun environment where players learn and practice cyber security concepts through the game. In this paper we propose Riskio, a tabletop game to increase cyber security awareness for people with no-technical background working in organisations. Riskio provides an active learning environment where players build knowledge on cyber security attacks and defences by playing both the role of the attacker and the defender of critical assets in a fictitious organisation.

How integration of cyber security management and incident response enables organizational learning. Digital assets of organizations are under constant threat from a wide assortment of nefarious actors. When threats materialize, the consequences can be significant. Most large organizations invest in a dedicated information security management (ISM) function to ensure that digital assets are protected. The ISM function conducts risk assessments, develops strategy, provides policies and training to define roles and guide behavior, and implements technological controls such as firewalls, antivirus, and encryption to restrict unauthorized access. Despite these protective measures, incidents (security breaches) will occur. Alongside the security management function, many organizations also retain an incident response (IR) function to mitigate damage from an attack and promptly restore digital services. However, few organizations integrate and learn from experiences of these functions in an optimal manner that enables them to not only respond to security incidents, but also proactively maneuver the threat environment. In this article we draw on organizational learning theory to develop a conceptual framework that explains how the ISM and IR functions can be better integrated. The strong integration of ISM and IR functions, in turn, creates learning opportunities that lead to organizational security benefits including: increased awareness of security risks, compilation of threat intelligence, removal of flaws in security defenses, evaluation of security defensive logic, and enhanced security response. 
The Missing Link: Aircraft Cybersecurity at the Operational Level. Aircraft cybersecurity efforts have tended to focus at the strategic or tactical levels without a clear connection between the two. There are many excellent engineering tools already in widespread use, but many organizations have not yet integrated and linked them into an overarching campaign planthat connects those tactical actions such as process hazard analysis, threat modeling, and probabilistic methods to the desired strategic outcome of secure and resilient systems. This article presents the combined systems security engineering process (CSSEP) as a way to fill that gap. Systems theory provides the theoretical foundation on which CSSEP is built. CSSEP is structured as a control loop in which the engineering team is the controller of the design process. The engineering team needs to have an explicit process model on how systems should be secured, and a control algorithm that determines what control actions should be selected. CSSEP's process model postulates that security is best achieved by a balance of cybersecurity, cyber resiliency, defensibility, and recoverability and that control is best established by developing security constraints versus attempting to find every vulnerability. CSSEP then transmits those security constraints as requirements into the design process. The design process used in CSSEP is the prioritized integrated cyber assessment methodology (PICAM). PICAM includes four phases that are looped including mission analysis, cooperative testing, adversarial assessment, and secure design. Feedback is then presented back to the engineering team using the probabilistic mission risk analysis (PMRA) supported by test data to close the control loop. CSSEP identifies the major functions needed to do effective aircraft cybersecurity and provides a flexible framework as the missing linkto connect the strategic and tactical levels of aircraft cybersecurity. 
Crypto Mining Attacks in Information Systems: An Emerging Threat to Cyber Security. The popularity of cryptocurrencies has continued to grow drastically over the past decade and this has drawn significant attention to various threat actors. Cybercriminals are now employing unconventional means to acquire cryptocurrencies at the expense of benign Internet users. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art crypto mining attacks by examining the malware code and the behavioral analysis upon execution. It examines the two most common attack approaches. web browser-based crypto mining which leverages JavaScript and installable binary crypto mining where the malware runs in memory. Furthermore, the paper investigates how cybercriminals endeavor to establish a persistence mechanism and avoid detection. The results from static and dynamic analysis uncover the techniques employed by the malware to exploit potential victims. Indicators of compromise are drawn from the uncovered artifacts which can be used as inputs to intrusion detection systems to help mitigate such cyber-attacks.

Centralized IT Decision Making and Cybersecurity Breaches: Evidence from U.S. Higher Education Institutions. Despite the consensus that information security should become an important consideration in information technology (IT) governance rather than the sole responsibility of the IT department, important IT governance decisions are often made on the basis of fulfilling business needs with a minimal amount of attention paid to their implications for information security. We study how an important IT governance mechanism—the degree of centralized decision making—affects the likelihood of cybersecurity breaches. Examining a sample of 504 U.S. higher-education institutions over a four-year period, we find that a university with centralized IT governance is associated with fewer breaches. Interestingly, the effect of centralized IT governance is contingent on the heterogeneity of a university’s computing environment: Universities with more heterogeneous IT infrastructure benefit more from centralized IT decision making. In addition, we find the relationship between centralized governance and cybersecurity breaches is most pronounced in public universities and those with more intensive research activities. Collectively, these findings highlight the tradeoff between granting autonomy and flexibility in the use of information systems and enforcing standardized, organization-wide security protocols. centralized decision making. cybersecurity breach.

An integral pedagogical strategy for teaching and learning iot cybersecurity. Internet of Things (IoT) has become a fundamental content of any engineering program due to the emerging need of experts in this field. However, the complexity of technologies that interact in IoT environments and the amount of different professional profiles required to design, implement and manage IoT environments, considering cybersecurity as a must, has led to a huge challenge in the educational world. This paper proposes an integral pedagogical strategy for learning IoT cybersecurity structured in three different stages, in a higher education institution. These stages focus not only on the content about IoT and cybersecurity but also on the competencies to acquire, the most suitable learning methodologies and the expected learning outcomes. The association of these concepts in each stage is detailed. Examples of courses are explained, the related competencies and learning outcomes are specified, and the contents and methodologies to achieve the expected results are described. An analysis of student results and stakeholder evaluations is provided to verify if the pedagogical strategy proposed is suitable. Furthermore, students’ feedback is included to corroborate the innovation, the suitability of the acquired skills, and the overall student satisfaction with the related courses and consequently with the proposed IoT cybersecurity pedagogical strategy.

A Robust Cybersecurity Solution Platform Architecture for Digital Instrumentation and Control Systems in Nuclear Power Facilities. Most nuclear power plants (NPPs) under construction or under design are expected to deploy largely digital instrumentation and control (I&C) systems. Current fleets are increasingly looking toward converting to digital I&C systems due to the advantages of precise control, economic operation, and ease of procurement over conventional analog I&C systems. With all the benefits digital I&C systems bring, challenging cybersecurity concerns are introduced as well. Cyberattacks targeted at industrial control systems have grown in both frequency and capability in recent years. Despite efforts to air-gap digital I&C systems, NPPs can be vulnerable to these cyberattacks, as evidenced by recent cyber incidents at nuclear facilities. Cybersecurity of NPPs should be addressed in three complementary thrusts: cyberattack prevention, detection, and response. Considering the requirements of digital I&C systems, we propose a novel cybersecurity solution platform that consists of a data collection and extraction system, a multilayer cyberattack detection system, a cause analysis system with dynamic risk assessment, a cyberattack response system, and a main control room display system. This architecture also promotes cooperation between information technology experts and the operation technology team to improve cybersecurity by integrating process data together with traditional host system and network data in a unified platform. This paper presents the proposed cybersecurity architecture and demonstrates its efficacy with a simulated cyberattack on a cyber-physical system testbed. Together with traditional intrusion prevention methods and rule-based intrusion detection systems, this platform provides a solution for prevention, detection, and response to cyberattacks that is congruous with the defense-in-depth strategies of other NPP safety and security systems.

Choosing between persistent engagement and deterrence in the American cybersecurity strategy [ПОСТОЯННАЯ ВОВЛЕЧЁННОСТЬ В КИБЕРПРОСТРАНСТВЕ НОВАЯ СТРАТЕГИЯ США И ЕЁ СООТНОШЕНИЕ С КОНЦЕПЦИЕЙ КИБЕРСДЕРЖИВАНИЯ]. The article examines the adoption by the United States of a new policy for ensuring cybersecurity, a strategy of peristent engagement in cyberspace, and how it is related to the strategy of cyber deterrence that remained dominant for a long time. The strategy of persistent engagement implies the constant conduct of cyber operations that do not reach the level of an armed conflict and combining purely defensive activities with offense. Such strategy is designed to prevent US rivals from carrying out malicious actions in cyberspace and to preserve strategic advantages of the United States by imposing additional costs on opponents and creating tactical friction for them. According to experts, persistent engagement perfectly suits the unique characteristics of cyberspace (interconnectedness and the condition of constant contact), unlike a strategy of deterrence that is suitable for traditional areas of military operations. Nevertheless, the US leadership is not ready to abandon the cyber deterrence strategy, and it is looking for ways to conceptually combine the two strategies. The paper presents the key characteristics of persistent engagement, some of which are: 1) cyber operations do not reach the level of an armed conflict. 2) persistent engagement is not an armed conflict. 3) creating tactical friction and imposing costs on US opponents. 4) preventive defense. Expert opinions on the prospects of persistent engagement are presented and analyzed. The paper demonstrates the analysis potential advantages and drawbacks of this approach. American specialists expect that persistent engagement will lead to an automatic formation of criteria for acceptable behavior in the process of strategic competition. Among the obvious drawbacks of the analyzed approach, one can single out a possible international escalation due to its application. The author analyzes the transformation of the conceptual status of cyberspace and the institutional changes, caused by this new strategic approach. The conclusions regarding the prospects for this strategy are ambiguous. Its effectiveness, safety and risks will become known only with time during the actual application of this strategy and the accumulation of empirical experience. The relevance of the work is due to the current strategic situation between the United States and Russia. Understanding the United States' approaches to cybersecurity and the key strategic changes in them is crucial not only to formulate Russia's cybersecurity policy, but also to build a constructive dialogue with the United States on cybersecurity issues.

Digital Forensics in Cyber Security - Recent Trends, Threats, and Opportunities. The rapid technological advancement has led the entire world to shift towards digital domain. However, this transition has also result in the emergence of cybercrimes and security breach incidents that threatens the privacy and security of the users. Therefore, this paper aimed at examining the use of digital forensics in countering cybercrimes, which has been a critical breakthrough in cybersecurity. The paper has analyzed the most recent trends in digital forensics, which include cloud forensics, social media forensics, and IoT forensics. These technologies are helping the cybersecurity professionals to use the digital traces left by the data storage and processing to keep data safe, while identifying the cybercriminals. However, the research has also observed specific threats to digital forensics, which include technical, operational and personnel- related challenges. The high complexity of these systems, large volume of data, chain of custody, the integrity of personnel, and the validity and accuracy of digital forensics are major threats to its large-scale use. Nevertheless, the paper has also observed the use of USB forensics, intrusion detection and artificial intelligence as major opportunities for digital forensics that can make the processes easier, efficient, and safe.

A study of cyber security issues in Sri Lanka. Cybersecurity is focused on helping the community to make knowledgeable decisions on its adaptation and mitigation. This survey evaluated the level of cybersecurity awareness and discernment amongst university students in Sri Lanka. The study was based on primary data collected through a questionnaire on awareness and the perception of cybersecurity from respondents at universities in Sri Lanka. The results indicated that experience and the level of cybersecurity awareness among university students in Sri Lanka are not significantly low, but there are some knowledge gaps with new threats. Further, the results showed that university students in Sri Lanka were able to identify cybercrime as a threat. These findings necessitate building awareness and developing capacity to improve student’s knowledge on the cybersecurity subject especially if universities are to be used as a key focal point in cybersecurity awareness campaigns in Sri Lanka.

Optimal Key Generation for Data Sanitization and Restoration of Cloud Data: Future of Financial Cyber Security. Cloud security in finance is considered as the key importance, taking account of the aspect of critical data stored over cloud spaces within organizations all around the globe. They are chiefly relying on cloud computing to accelerate their business profitability and scale up their business processes with enhanced productivity coming through flexible work environments offered in cloud-run working systems. Hence, there is a prerequisite to contemplate cloud security in the entire financial service sector. Moreover, the main issue challenged by privacy and security is the presence of diverse chances to attack the sensitive data by cloud operators, which leads to double the user's anxiety on the stored data. For solving this problem, the main intent of this paper is to develop an intelligent privacy preservation approach for data stored in the cloud sector, mainly the financial data. The proposed privacy preservation model involves two main phases: (a) data sanitization and (b) data restoration. In the sanitization process, the sensitive data is hidden, which prevents sensitive information from leaking on the cloud side. Further, the normal as well as the sensitive data is stored in a cloud environment. For the sanitization process, a key should be generated that depends on the new meta-heuristic algorithm called crossover improved-lion algorithm (CI-LA), which is inspired by the lion's unique social behavior. During data restoration, the same key should be used for effectively restoring the original data. Here, the optimal key generation is done in such a way that the objective model involves the degree of modification, hiding rate, and information preservation rate, which effectively enhance the cyber security performance in the cloud. cloud sector. cloud security. crossover improved-lion algorithm.

A hybrid approach for cyber security: Improved intrusion detection system using ann-svm. The instances of cyber attacks are increasing as of exponential hike in online processing amid COVID-19 pandemic scenario that significantly compromising huge number of confidential data as well. With the rising security demands, the detection of cyber-attacks has emerged as a promising field that offers wider scope for the application developers. In the similar scenario, authors have proposed an improved detection system that could effectively detect attacks as DDoS, malware etc. Initially, Genetic Algorithm is implemented for the feature section and reducing the size of data thereby reducing the computational work load of classifiers. In second phase, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Artificial Bee colony (ABC) is used to divides the data into four categories and also filters out the irrelevant features. In later stages, Artificial Neural Network is employed whose results are refined by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The novelty of the work lies in the precise detection of the malicious behaviour of the nodes. This ANN-SVM hybrid approach enhanced the classification efficiency of the proposed system in identifying the cyber-attacks. The simulation study over 1000 rounds reflects the performance of the proposed system in terms of higher precision, recall and f-measure in comparison to the existing works dedicated to deal with DDoS attacks. Also, the proposed work demonstrated better outcomes in terms of average True Positive rate and False Positive rate. Artificial Neural Network. Discrete Wavelet Transform with Artificial Bee colony.

A Cybersecurity Terminarch: Use It before We Lose It. Why can't we send encrypted email (secure, private correspondence that even our mail providers can't read)? Why do our health-care providers require us to use secure portals to correspond with us instead of directly emailing us? Why are messaging apps the only way to send encrypted messages directly to friends, and why can't we send private messages without agreeing to using a single platform (WhatsApp, Signal, and so on)? Our cybersecurity tools have not evolved to offer these services, but why? . 
Edge intelligence assisted gateway defense in cyber security. Advanced persistent threat, network intrusions and anomalies, and invasions of location and data privacy are constantly violating edge networks, disturbing guaranteed services, and further destroying critical end devices and cyberinfrastructure. Edge gateway defense against malicious cyber threats and privacy leakage for a multitude of connected physical devices remains a significant problem. Edge computing empowered network intelligence will become a practical solution to tackle this challenge by building gateway-focused protection mechanisms, dynamically extending the edge network, and establishing a flexible and intelligent platform to perform rapid responses with the cloud and wide area network. In this article, we present the research in edge intelligence assisted gateway defense in cyber security. Specifically, we first provide the overview of edge computing, and then discuss the motivations of developing and deploying a robust and effective edge intelligence. We also present the details of edge intelligence assisted gateway defense, including major cyber threats and defense mechanisms at gateways. We further offer detailed descriptions of the emerging data-driven approaches for gateway defense. Finally, we perform an experimental study, and we demonstrate that robust edge intelligence achieves high detection accuracy and effective computational performance. 
Blockchain-based data-preserving AI learning environment model for AI cybersecurity systems in IoT service environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) has a limitation in that it is only in the passive cognition area, so its operating process is not transparent. therefore, the technology relies on learning data. Since raw data for AI learning are processed and inspected manually to assure high quality for sophisticated AI learning, human errors are inevitable, and damaged and incomplete data and differences from the original data may lead to unexpected outputs of AI learning for which processed data are used. In this context, this research examines cases where AI learning data were inaccurate, in terms of cybersecurity, and the need for learning data management before machine learning through analysis of cybersecurity attack techniques, and we propose the direction of establishing a data-preserving AI system, which is a blockchain-based learning data environment model to verify the integrity of learning data. The data-preserving AI learning environment model is expected to prevent cyberattacks and data deterioration that may occur when data are provided and utilized in an open network for the processing and collection of raw data.

Data-Driven Cyber Security in Perspective - Intelligent Traffic Analysis. Social and Internet traffic analysis is fundamental in detecting and defending cyber attacks. Traditional approaches resorting to manually defined rules are gradually replaced by automated approaches empowered by machine learning. This revolution is accelerated by huge datasets which support machine-learning models with outstanding performance. In the context of a data-driven paradigm, this article reviews recent analytic research on cyber traffic over social networks and the Internet by using a set of common concepts of similarity, correlation, and collective indication, and by sharing security goals for classifying network host or applications and users or Tweets. The ability to do so is not determined in isolation, but rather drawn for a wide use of many different network or social flows. Furthermore, the flows exhibit many characteristics, such as fixed sized and multiple messages between source and destination. This article demonstrates a new research methodology of data-driven cyber security (DDCS) and its application in social and Internet traffic analysis. The framework of the DDCS methodology consists of three components, that is, cyber security data processing, cyber security feature engineering, and cyber security modeling. Challenges and future directions in this field are also discussed. Cyber security. Internet traffic analysis. machine learning (ML). social spam detection. 
Cyber Security Responsibilization: An Evaluation of the Intervention Approaches Adopted by the Five Eyes Countries and China. Governments can intervene to a greater or lesser extent in managing the risks that citizens face. They can adopt a maximal intervention approach (e.g., COVID-19) or a hands-off approach (e.g., unemployment), effectively responsibilizing their citizens. To manage the cyber risk, governments publish cyber-related policies. This article examines the intervention stances the governments adopt in supporting individual citizens managing their personal cyber risk. The authors pinpoint the cyber-related responsibilities that several governments espouse, applying a responsibilization analysis. Those applying to citizens are identified, thereby revealing the governments' cyber-related intervention stances. The analysis reveals that most governments adopt a minimal cyber-related intervention stance in supporting their citizens. Given the increasing number of successful cyber attacks on individuals, it seems time for the consequences of this stance to be acknowledged and reconsidered. The authors argue that governments should support individual citizens more effectively in dealing with cyber threats. 
Calculated risk? A cybersecurity evaluation tool for SMEs. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are among the least mature and most vulnerable in terms of their cybersecurity risk and resilience. In this article, we describe a methodology developed using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as a starting point. The NIST CSF does not meet all the needs of the SME IT leader, but it offers a solid foundation for a useful evaluation and recommendation methodology. We propose an SME cybersecurity evaluation tool (CET) that consists of a 35-question online survey to be completed by IT leaders to self-rate their maturity within the five NIST framework categories: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. We outline this approach to cybersecurity risk management before discussing its effectiveness and implications for practitioners. Cyber resilience. Cyber-risk mitigation.

Event evolution model for cybersecurity event mining in tweet streams. The rich source of online reports and discussions on social media can be leveraged to investigate the widespread cyber-attacks. In this paper, we study the problem of cybersecurity event mining based on continuous tweet streams. In contrast to traditional static methods that do not consider event evolution, we explore relevance among historical and online events for cyber-attack event discovery and evolution detection. We propose CyberEM, a novel event evolution model with a special focus on cybersecurity events. A pattern clustering algorithm and an NMF-based (non-negative matrix factorization) event aggregation algorithm are devised for cyber-attack indicator extraction and event evolution detection. We leverage both the patterns that belong to the cybersecurity domain and the patterns of the semantic contexts of cybersecurity to refine evolutionary relevance of events across multiple time intervals. Furthermore, we design a dynamic event inference algorithm to discover cybersecurity events and update event aggregation in an online manner. Through extensive evaluations with a large-scale real-world tweet dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CyberEM model over existing methods in identifying cybersecurity events and their evolutionary relevance.

Cyber security incidents analysis and classification in a case study of Korean enterprises. The increasing amount and complexity of Cyber security attacks in recent years have made text analysis and data mining techniques an important factor in discovering features of such attacks and detecting future security threats. In this paper, we report on the results of a recent case study that involved the analysis of a community data set collected from five small and medium companies in Korea. The data set represents Cyber security incidents and response actions. We investigated in the study the kind of problems concerned with the prediction of response actions to future incidents from features of past incidents. Our analysis is based on text mining methods, such as n-gram and bag-of-words, as well as on machine learning algorithms for the classification of incidents and their response actions. Based on the results of the study, we also suggest an experience-sharing model, which we use to demonstrate how companies may share their trained classifiers without the sharing of their individual data sets in a collaborative environment.

Ensuring cybersecurity of smart grid against data integrity attacks under concept drift. For achieving increasing artificial intelligence in future smart grids, a very precise state estimation (SE) is required as a prerequisite for many other key functionalities for successful monitoring and control. With increasing interconnection of utility network and internet, traditional state estimators are vulnerable to complex data integrity attacks, such as false data injection (FDI), bypassing existing bad data detection (BDD) schemes. While researchers propose detectors for FDI, such countermeasures neglect power state changes due to contingencies. As such an abrupt physical change negatively affects existing FDI detectors, they will provide incorrect classification of the new instances. To resolve the problem, we conducted analysis for a fundamental understanding of the differences between a physical grid change and data manipulation change. We use outage as an example and propose to analyze historical data followed by concept drift, focusing on distribution change. The key is to find critical lines to narrow down the scope. Techniques such as dimensionality reduction and statistical hypothesis testing are employed. The proposed approach is evaluated on the IEEE 14 bus system using load data from the New York independent system operator with two different attack scenarios: (1) attacks without concept drift, (2) attacks under concept drift. Numerical results show that the new method significantly increases the accuracy of the existing detection methods under concept drift. Data integrity attacks. Line outage. Machine learning.

Factors affecting risky cybersecurity behaviors by U.S. workers: An exploratory study. Behavioral determinants of cybersecurity have gained greater attention among information technology experts in recent years. However, drivers of risky cybersecurity behavior have not been widely studied. This exploratory study examines the extent to which risky cybersecurity behavior is predicted by factors of cybersecurity-related avoidance behavior. Self-reported risky cybersecurity behavior was examined in light of technology threat avoidance factors in a sample of 184 working adults in the United States. Risky behaviors were measured using the instrument by Hadlington (2017), previously used by researchers to measure behavioral associations with non-technology threat avoidance-related items. Hierarchical regression noted significant predictive associations between several technology threat avoidance factors and self-reported risky cybersecurity behavior: perceived susceptibility (p = .027), perceived cost (p = .003), and self-efficacy (p = .043). Combined, these variables explained 9.4% of the adjusted variance in levels of risky cybersecurity behavior (p = .001). Effect size calculations revealed predictive impacts in the low-medium range. Age was also confirmed as a confounding covariate (p = .045). The impact findings uniquely distinguish this study from previous works. Findings also infer that training in protective behavior can mitigate a significant portion of risky cybersecurity behavior. Age and risky cybersecurity behavior.

Development of a quantitative method for identifying fault-prone cyber security controls in NPP digital I&C systems. The nuclear regulatory organizations have developed the regulatory guidance for assessment and selection of cyber security controls. One of the important considerations is that the performance and reliability of safety-grade software system must not be degraded by the cyber security controls. However, the nuclear industry has difficulty in applying and verifying the cyber security controls because of the complicated structure of digital I&C systems and the vast amount of cyber security controls. In this study, in order to solve the problem, a cyber security control V&V process model is developed based on the concept of adaptive focusing testing. In addition, a quantitative method for identifying and prioritizing fault-prone cyber security controls is developed. It was confirmed that the developed model can provide an additional and more objective context for the subjective judgement of experts. Adaptive focusing test. Cyber security control.

Privacy, cybersecurity, and GATS article XIV: A new frontier for trade and internet regulation?. Measures restricting data flows outside one’s borders, including mandatory data/server localization measures, are not only a barrier to trade, but also largely ineffective in achieving better internet security or trust. Nevertheless, governments deploy such measures, primarily on grounds of cybersecurity and privacy, potentially violating their obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). In this article, I investigate whether GATS-inconsistent measures may be justified under GATS Art. XIV when aimed at ensuring privacy or cybersecurity, and, if so, whether GATS Art. XIV effectively balances trade and internet policy. As the internet governance framework is complex and somewhat ambiguous, applying GATS Art. XIV to cybersecurity/privacy measures necessitates balancing of trade liberalization principles and domestic internet policy. This exercise can be effective in weeding out data localization measures disguised as privacy/ cybersecurity measures, particularly by employing relevant technical and factual evidence. However, given the lack of binding international law/norms on these issues, GATS Art. XIV has a limited role, particularly in cases involving direct conflict between multistakeholder/transnational internet norms and domestic internet policies, or where the measures are founded on contentious standards/benchmarks on privacy/cybersecurity. Ultimately, ensuring free and secure data flows requires a multidimensional policy response, including strengthening linkages between trade law and internet governance. 
The gender focus in Chile's national cyber security policy [El enfoque de género en la política nacional de ciberseguridad de Chile]. Chile's National Cybersecurity Policy indicates that in the matter of fundamental rights, a gender focus must be used to ensure the equality of all people in cyberspace. This article aims to analyze what should be understood by gender focus in the context of the National Cybersecurity Policy and the importance of reducing the gender gap in women's training and technology management. The analysis will focus on describing the main dangers and transgressions suffered by women in cyberspace, specifically in terms of privacy and data protection, to express that only to the extent that all sectors of society are aware of this inequality, we can achieve an open, safe, resilient and egalitarian cyberspace.

Cyber security based machine learning algorithms applied to industry 4.0 application case: Development of network intrusion detection system using hybrid method. The implementation of industry 4.0 is a complex process that involves several steps and management of a project involving all the company's resources: production, supply chain, engineering, maintenance, human resources, information systems and many others. faced of the risks weighing on companies, and even more on their sensitive data, the need to create a cybersecurity strategy for the Industry 4.0 is more essential than ever. It has been apparent for several years that industrial systems are vulnerable to computer attacks. This can be explained because they were not designed with security constraints, particularly because of their physical isolation from Internet. However, they now face a variety of attackers with different objectives and abilities. In this paper, we present our strategy of cybersecurity, based on machine learning algorithms, applied in the context of industry 4.0. For this purpose, Unified Threat Management based on machine learning algorithms (ML-UTM) was used. to touch all layers of pyramid of Computer Integrated Manufacturing we propose to put an ML-UTM between layer 4 and 3, and an Industrial Unified Threat Management based on machine learning algorithms (ML-IUTM) between layer 3 and 2, another ML-IUTM between layer 2 and 1. Then we will cite the works based on the use of filtering device between layers 1 and 0. This paper describes a machine learning approach to build an efficient and accurate network intrusion detection system, which is one of the features of UTM, using a hybrid method. Thus, we have combined the different machine learning algorithms, namely Support vector machine (SVM), One rule (OneR), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and Random forest (RF) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method using a real data set (Gas pipeline), and according to the results of our analysis, we have selected the best optimized classifier. The experimental results have demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of the proposed approach. The PSO method can provide various advantages to K-NN and RF classifiers such as higher accuracy, lower MSE and faster time to build model. After analyzing and comparing all these results it was found that the NIDS based RF optimized by PSO give the best performances, with accuracy of 99.30%, F-measure of 99,30% and MSE that has been reduced to 0,0034.

Methodology forming for the approaches to the cyber security of information systems management. This paper establishes the analogy of displaying an information security management system (ISMS) for information systems (IS) as a queuing system (QS). It became possible through the identification of structural and functional analogies between ISMS and QS. As a result of such analogy, it became possible to model the ISMS as a QS, and subsequently formulate the initial requirements for the ISMS IS. It was defined that the ISMS can be interpreted as a single-phase QS with possible losses. Model for determination of the QS parameters was developed. Due to structural, substantive and functional analogies, newly created models allow one to form range of quantitative ISMS characteristics for IS. This allows one to ensure the effectiveness of the ISMS design process, taking into account the prospects of increasing complexity and the number of destructive effects on IP by attackers. Computational experiments, carried out using a specially designed software application, confirmed the reliability of the main theoretical provisions and practical developments.

Cognitive Models in Cybersecurity: Learning From Expert Analysts and Predicting Attacker Behavior. Cybersecurity stands to benefit greatly from models able to generate predictions of attacker and defender behavior. On the defender side, there is promising research suggesting that Symbolic Deep Learning (SDL) may be employed to automatically construct cognitive models of expert behavior based on small samples of expert decisions. Such models could then be employed to provide decision support for non-expert users in the form of explainable expert-based suggestions. On the attacker side, there is promising research suggesting that model-tracing with dynamic parameter fitting may be used to automatically construct models during live attack scenarios, and to predict individual attacker preferences. Predicted attacker preferences could then be exploited for mitigating risk of successful attacks. In this paper we examine how these two cognitive modeling approaches may be useful for cybersecurity professionals via two human experiments. In the first experiment participants play the role of cyber analysts performing a task based on Intrusion Detection System alert elevation. Experiment results and analysis reveal that SDL can help to reduce missed threats by 25%. In the second experiment participants play the role of attackers picking among four attack strategies. Experiment results and analysis reveal that model-tracing with dynamic parameter fitting can be used to predict (and exploit) most attackers' preferences 40−70% of the time. We conclude that studies and models of human cognition are highly valuable for advancing cybersecurity. behavioral simulations. cognitive modeling. cyber-security. decision support. deep learning. human-agent teaming. reinforcement learning.

Cybersecurity behaviour of smartphone users in India: an empirical analysis. Purpose: For a good number of Indians, their smartphone is their first digital computing device. They have less experience in dealing with the Internet-enabled device and hence less experience in handling security threats like malware as compared to users of other countries who have gone through the learning curve of handling such security threats using other Internet-enabled devices such as laptop and desktop. Because of this, the inexperienced Indian smartphone user may be vulnerable to Internet-related security breaches, as compared to the citizens of developed economies. Hence, it is essential to understand the attitude, behaviour and security practices of smartphone users in India. Limited research is available about the security behaviour of smartphone users in India as the majority of research in this domain is done outside India. Design/methodology/approach: In this empirical study, the researchers identified 28 cybersecurity behaviours and practices through a survey of relevant literature. An online survey of identified cybersecurity behaviours and practices was administered to 300 smartphone users. Frequency analysis of the respondent data was done to understand the adoption of recommended cybersecurity behaviours and practices. Pearson’s chi-square with 5% level of significance has been used to test the hypotheses. Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction was conducted for statistically significant associations. Findings: Overall, the respondents did not exhibit good cybersecurity behaviour. Respondents have adopted some of the most popular security features of the smartphone such as the use of screen lock. However, respondents have not adopted or are not aware of the technical security controls such as encryption and remote wipe. Statistically significant differences were found between the cybersecurity behaviour and practices and independent variables such as gender, age, mobile operating system (OS) and mother tongue. Respondents reported high level of motivation to protect their device and data, whereas they reported moderate level of threat awareness and the ability to protect to their device and data. Results of the comparative analysis with a similar study in China and the USA are also reported in this study. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this study are as follows: the respondents' perceptions about their cybersecurity behaviours and practices were measured as opposed to their actual behaviours and practices and the generalizability of the study is limited because the sample size is small as compared to the total number of smartphone users in India. Practical implications: The findings of this study may be useful for the design of effective cybersecurity prevention and intervention programs for general smartphone users of India. Originality/value: This study provides an insight about cybersecurity behaviour of smartphone users in India. To the knowledge of the researchers, this is the first study to collect such quantitative data of smartphone users in India for a better understanding of the cybersecurity behaviours and practices. This study identified 28 cybersecurity behaviours and practices, which smartphone users should follow to improve cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. Human aspect. India. Quantitative analysis.

Enhancing cyber security behavior: an internal social marketing approach. Purpose: Understanding the behavioral change process of system users to adopt safe security practices is important to the success of an organization’s cybersecurity program. This study aims to explore how the 7Ps (product, price, promotion, place, physical evidence, process and people) marketing mix, as part of an internal social marketing approach, can be used to gain an understanding of employees’ interactions within an organization’s cybersecurity environment. This understanding could inform the design of servicescapes and behavioral infrastructure to promote and maintain cybersecurity compliance. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted an inductive qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with employees in several Vietnamese organizations. Discussions were centered on employee experiences and their perceptions of cybersecurity initiatives, as well as the impact of initiatives on compliance behavior. Responses were then categorized under the 7Ps marketing mix framework. Findings: The study shows that assessing a cybersecurity program using the 7P mix enables the systematic capture of users’ security compliance and acceptance of IT systems. Additionally, understanding the interactions between system elements permits the design of behavioral infrastructure to enhance security efforts. Results also show that user engagement is essential in developing secure systems. User engagement requires developing shared objectives, localized communications, co-designing of efficient processes and understanding the pain points of security compliance. The knowledge developed from this research provides a framework for those managing cybersecurity systems and enables the design human-centered systems conducive to compliance. Originality/value: The study is one of the first to use a cross-disciplinary social marketing approach to examine how employees experience and comply with security initiatives. Previous studies have mostly focused on determinants of compliance behavior without providing a clear platform for management action. Internal social marketing using 7Ps provides a simple but innovative approach to reexamine existing compliance approaches. Findings from the study could leverage proven successful marketing techniques to promote security compliance. 7P marketing mix. Behavior change. Cyber security. Human factors in security.

Transnational governance of cybersecurity: policy challenges and global inequalities in cyber capacity building. Connectivity infrastructure is constantly expanding, increasing internet access across countries, regions and socio-political contexts. Given the fast-changing geography of the internet, there is a growing demand to strengthen cyber capacity beyond national frameworks, in order to develop a transnationally coherent and coordinated governance approach to cybersecurity. In this context, cyber capacity building initiatives are increasingly central in international debates, with the ambition to support countries in the Global South in fostering their cybersecurity strategy from technical and policy perspectives. This article discusses the key factors explaining states’ efforts to enhance their cyber capacity. Based on a cross-national quantitative research approach, the findings contradict international relations (IR)-derived approaches to cybersecurity, which assume that countries develop their cyber capacity according to external security threats, domestic politics or norms. In line with existing research on the role that science plays in policymaking processes more broadly, our results suggest instead that a country’s science and technical knowledge is the most robust explanation for that state’s cyber capacity level. These findings emphasise the need for policymakers to support countries in the Global South in developing their cyber capacity beyond national security paradigms by strengthening education and technical skills in contexts lacking in this resource. cyber capacity building.

Ensuring cybersecurity in shipping: Reference to Estonian shipowners. Ships, ports and offshore facilities are increasingly becoming dependent on modern information and opera-tional technology. Cyber incidents on ships can create disruptions of critical systems that cause problems for the ship’s safe operation. Therefore, the shipowners must be prepared to cope with rising cyber threats. In or-der to prevent cyber incidents happening on ships and in the companies, essential steps must be taken on the management level. This paper introduces results of two surveys on cybersecurity and cyber awareness carried out in between 2017 – 2019 among the shipping companies operating in Estonia. Feedback was received from 12 shipowners out of 19 and the results show that at least 7 organisations had been the victims to different types of cyberattacks. The results indicate that shipowners are not paying enough of attention to potential cyber threats and education of their employees. Finally, the paper proposes cyber risk mitigation means for the shipowners. 
Is cybersecurity A team sport? A multilevel examination of workgroup information security effectiveness. Organizations maintain their desired level of cybersecurity by evaluating the information security (ISec) effectiveness of their organizational units. Numerous ISec studies have delved into examining individual compliance, yet studies that develop an understanding about achieving the desired effect of the workgroup ISec have been scarce in the literature. Against this backdrop, this research note draws on the input–process–output framework to take a multilevel approach and examines how an individual security factor (individual self-efficacy) and two core workgroup mechanisms (workgroup collective efficacy andsecurity knowledge coordination) can together affect workgroup information security effectiveness (WISE). Using a survey, data for the independent variables of the study was collected from 68 branch offices (with 536 employees in total) of a law enforcement agency in South Korea. Separately, for WISE, we obtained the branch offices’ annual security assessment scores from the organization. The results reveal the cross-level nature of WISE, suggesting that group mechanisms significantly mediate the relationship between individual self-efficacy and WISE. The results support the view that group mechanisms are important in ISec management and need to be considered alongside the individual-level analysis in the pursuit of workgroup ISec performance. The findings provide insightful implications for both theory and practice. Collective efficacy. Multilevel structural equation model. Security knowledge coordination. Social cognitive theory.

Vessels Cybersecurity: Issues, Challenges, and the Road Ahead. Vessels cybersecurity is gaining momentum as a result of a few recent attacks on vessels at sea. These recent attacks have shocked the maritime domain, which was thought to be relatively immune to cyber threats. That belief is now over, as proved by recent mandates issued by the International Maritime Organization. According to these regulations, all vessels should be the subject of a cybersecurity risk analysis, and technical controls should be adopted to mitigate the resulting risks. This initiative is laudable since, despite the recent incidents, the vulnerabilities and threats affecting modern vessels are still unclear to operating entities, leaving the potential for dreadful consequences of further attacks just a matter of when,not if.In this contribution, we investigate and systematize the major security weaknesses affecting systems and communication technologies adopted in modern vessels. Specifically, we describe the architecture and main features of the different systems, pointing out their main security issues, and specifying how they were exploited by attackers to cause service disruption and relevant financial losses. We also identify a few countermeasures to the introduced attacks. Finally, we highlight a few research challenges to be addressed by industry and academia to strengthen vessels security. 
Applications of causal modeling in cybersecurity: An exploratory approach. Our research investigates the use of causal modeling and its application towards mapping out cybersecurity threat patterns. We test the strength of various methods of data breaches over its impact on the breach's discovery time as well as the number of records lost. Utilizing a Causal Modeling framework, we simulate the isolation of confounding variables while testing the robustness of varying estimators. The motivation is to shed a unique insight provided by the usage of Causal Modeling in cybersecurity. Causal Modeling. Cybersecurity. Data Breach. 
A survey and an IoT cybersecurity recommendation for public and private hospitals in Ecuador. It was analyzed the reference information on Cybersecurity architectures, models, standards, evaluations, mechanisms, and procedures applied to IoT domains, and public and private health area. The problem is the lack of proposals for IoT Cybersecurity in public and private hospitals to minimize random failures, ensure the privacy of personal data of patients, avoid the paralysis of the IoT medical network and minimize attacks on information assets. The objective is to perform a survey and an IoT Cybersecurity recommendation for public and private hospitals in Ecuador. The exploratory research was used to review references and specific analytical reasoning to end in a known scoop with a trusted solution. A survey of cybersecurity vs. competitiveness of hospitals in Ecuador resulted, a Model conceptual prototype of IoT Cybersecurity for a public or private hospital, an Architecture prototype of IoT Cybersecurity for a public or private hospital, and an Algorithm prototype of cybersecurity for IoT architecture. It was concluded that the cybersecurity standards applied to the design of IoT for a public or private hospital generates trust on information assets, preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information at the operational, tactical and strategic levels. the architecture prototype is between 59.38% and 99.71% of acceptable workload. This proposal is scalable and applicable to a public or private hospital regardless of the dimensions of areas, devices, floors, workers or other characteristics. the architecture only considers the hospital's own IoT devices and information. the devices of doctors or patients are not considered.

Cybersecurity Disclosure by the Companies on the S&P/TSX 60 Index. Cybersecurity has become a topic of great interest since 2010. Accounting issues surrounding cybersecurity governance, management, and disclosure have gained attention from accounting standard setters, large accounting firms, and professional associations, but only a limited number of studies have looked at cybersecurity disclosure. In this study, we examine whether the content of cybersecurity disclosures of Canadian firms comprising the S&P/TSX 60 index is aligned with best practices—that is, financial regulators' guidelines in that matter. A content analysis was performed of documents issued between January 2017 and mid-2018, consisting of recent annual information forms (AIFs), annual and quarterly management's discussion and analysis (MD&As), proxy circulars, material change reports, and news releases. To assess the nature and extent of cybersecurity disclosure, we developed a scoring grid featuring 40 items based on financial regulators' guidelines. Results show that cybersecurity disclosure levels are low. Companies vary widely in the amount of detail they provide, and the information is often not company-specific. The variations among industrial sectors involve the categories related to cybersecurity risk, cybersecurity risk mitigation, and other items. Most of the companies provided cybersecurity disclosures in the annual MD&A, and several reiterated some disclosure items in the AIF and proxy circular. The results of this study highlight some areas where cybersecurity disclosures have evolved and others where they could be improved. They suggest that some firms strive to avoid boilerplate language and be more company-specific. The findings also suggest that financial regulators could issue more stringent requirements.

The impact of reported cybersecurity breaches on firm innovation. Many firms cite cyber risk as a primary risk factor due to the increase in cybersecurity breach (CSB) incidents. Existing research focuses on the negative, short-term impacts from CSBs, but the longer-term impact is still unknown. Our study investigates firms’ levels of innovation following a CSB as an important determinant of firm growth and profitability. Examining reported breaches from 2005–2014, we find a 10 percent decline in research and development spending in the year following a CSB. Further investigation indicates that firms for which R&D is not the primary business model drive the results. We also provide evidence of a decrease in patents two years after a breach, an increase in cash holdings in the year after the breach, and a decrease in investment efficiency four years following the breach. Our aggregate results suggest that CSBs are associated with future strategic decisions involving firm-level innovation and investment decisions. Cybersecurity. Data breach. Innovation.

Cyber security and the remote workforce. Current world events have forced a sudden remote-working economy that many businesses were simply not prepared for. According to a Gartner survey of 229 human resources (HR) managers, 81% or more are working remotely, and 41% are likely to do so at least some of the time even once a return to normal working is permitted. This sudden rise in remote working is not only challenging employees to work in a way they had not previously, but it has also impacted the cyber-risk profile of enterprises worldwide. Organisations have built policies and procedures that protect individuals and the organisation's infrastructure. However, unless a significant percentage of employees had previous access to proper remote access technologies, there is a real risk of employees making bad choices. Organisations need to implement the correct tools to mitigate these threats, explains Kevin Curran of Ulster University. 
A multivariate model to quantify and mitigate cybersecurity risk. The cost of cybersecurity incidents is large and growing. However, conventional methods for measuring loss and choosing mitigation strategies use simplifying assumptions and are often not supported by cyber attack data. In this paper, we present a multivariate model for different, dependent types of attack and the effect of mitigation strategies on those attacks. Utilising collected cyber attack data and assumptions on mitigation approaches, we look at an example of using the model to optimise the choice of mitigations. We find that the optimal choice of mitigations will depend on the goal—to prevent extreme damages or damage on average. Numerical experiments suggest the dependence aspect is important and can alter final risk estimates by as much as 30%. The methodology can be used to quantify the cost of cyber attacks and support decision making on the choice of optimal mitigation strategies. Cyber risk. Operational risk. Optimal mitigations.

Teaching and learning IoT cybersecurity and vulnerability assessment with shodan through practical use cases. Shodan is a search engine for exploring the Internet and thus finding connected devices. Its main use is to provide a tool for cybersecurity researchers and developers to detect vulnerable Internet-connected devices without scanning them directly. Due to its features, Shodan can be used for performing cybersecurity audits on Internet of Things (IoT) systems and devices used in applications that require to be connected to the Internet. The tool allows for detecting IoT device vulnerabilities that are related to two common cybersecurity problems in IoT: the implementation of weak security mechanisms and the lack of a proper security configuration. To tackle these issues, this article describes how Shodan can be used to perform audits and thus detect potential IoT-device vulnerabilities. For such a purpose, a use case-based methodology is proposed to teach students and users to carry out such audits and then make more secure the detected exploitable IoT devices. Moreover, this work details how to automate IoT-device vulnerability assessments through Shodan scripts. Thus, this article provides an introductory practical guide to IoT cybersecurity assessment and exploitation with Shodan. Cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity. IoT. Security audit. Shodan.

Emulating and evaluating virtual remote laboratories for cybersecurity. Our society is nowadays evolving towards a digital era, due to the extensive use of computer technologies and their interconnection mechanisms, i.e., social networks, Internet resources, IoT services, etc. This way, new threats and vulnerabilities appear. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity of training students in the topic of cybersecurity, in which practical skills have to be acquired. In distance education, the inclusion of on-line resources for hands-on activities in its curricula is a key step in meeting that need. This work presents several contributions. First, the fundamentals of a virtual remote laboratory hosted in the cloud are detailed. This laboratory is a step forward since the laboratory combines both virtualization and cloud paradigms to dynamically create emulated environments. Second, this laboratory has also been integrated into the practical curricula of a cybersecurity subject, as an additional on-line resource. Third, the students’ traceability, in terms of their interactions with the laboratory, is also analyzed. Psychological TAM/UTAUT factors (perceived usefulness, estimated effort, social influence, attitude, ease of access) that may affect the intention of using the laboratory are analyzed. Fourth, the degree of satisfaction is analyzed with a great impact, since the mean values of these factors are most of them higher than 4 points out of 5. In addition to this, the students’ acceptance of the presented technology is exhaustively studied. Two structural equation models have been hypothesized and validated. Finally, the acceptance of the technology can be concluded as very good in order to be used in @? other Engineering contexts. In this sense, the calculated statistical values for the improved proposed model are within the expected ranges of reliability (X2 = 0.6, X2/DF = 0.3, GFI = 0.985, CIF = 0.985, RMSEA = 0) by considering the literature.

From defence to offence: The ethics of private cybersecurity. The cyber realm is increasingly vital to national security, but much of cybersecurity is provided privately. Private firms provide a range of roles, from purely defensive operations to more controversial ones, such as active-cyber defense (ACD) and 'hacking back'. As with the outsourcing of traditional military and security services to private military and security companies (PMSCs), the reliance on private firms raises the ethical question of to what extent the private sector should be involved in providing security services. In this article, I consider this question. I argue that a moderately restrictive approach should be adopted, which holds that private firms can justifiably launch some cybersecurity services - defensive measures - but are not permitted to perform others - offensive measures.

Adversarial genetic programming for cyber security: a rising application domain where GP matters. Cyber security adversaries and engagements are ubiquitous and ceaseless. We delineate Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cyber Security, a research topic that, by means of genetic programming (GP), replicates and studies the behavior of cyber adversaries and the dynamics of their engagements. Adversarial Genetic Programming for Cyber Security encompasses extant and immediate research efforts in a vital problem domain, arguably occupying a position at the frontier where GP matters. Additionally, it prompts research questions around evolving complex behavior by expressing different abstractions with GP and opportunities to reconnect to the machine learning, artificial life, agent-based modeling and cyber security communities. We present a framework called RIVALS which supports the study of network security arms races. Its goal is to elucidate the dynamics of cyber networks under attack by computationally modeling and simulating them. Coevolutionary algorithms. Cyber Security. Genetic programming. 
Cyber security vulnerabilities for outdoor vehicular visible light communication in secure platoon network: Review, power distribution, and signal to noise ratio analysis. Light Fidelity (LiFi), a 5th Generation visible light communication (VLC) technology, is anticipated to be utilized in various locations where radio frequency (RF) cannot be deployed, due to RF health limitations and congestion. VLC offers a robust communication link for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), where cars interact wirelessly to enhance the traffic flow and road safety. Thus VLC has been considered as a complementary approach to RF in Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, for its potential to mitigate security vulnerabilities caused in RF V2V communication by using light directivity and impermeability. V2V VLC privacy and security are fields that have been hardly examined. In this study, we work on multiple VLC challenges and motivation especially for the security performance of the physical layer of a V2V VLC-based protocol. We introduce an improved V2V VLC proposed model and define a security protocol to enhance received power distribution and secrecy performance. We followed a two-step process to achieve this aim, first decrease the LED semi-angle then apply the protected zone between the legitimate vehicles where adversaries are banned. The simulation results, measuring the received optical power, SNR and BER, show that V2V VLC received power and secrecy performance are improved by using the proposed model. LiFi. Safety. Security.

Cyber security for fog-based smart grid SCADA systems: Solutions and challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing cyber security solutions for fog-based smart grid SCADA systems. We start by providing an overview of the architecture and the concept of fog-based smart grid SCADA systems and its main components. According to security requirements and vulnerabilities, we provide a classification of these solutions into four categories, including authentication solutions, privacy-preserving solutions, key management systems, and intrusion detection systems. For each category, we describe the essence of the methods and provide a classification with respect to security requirements. Therefore, according to the machine learning methods used by the intrusion detection system (IDS), we classify the IDS solutions into nine categories, including deep learning-based IDS, artificial neural networks-based IDS, support vector machine-based IDS, decision tree-based IDS, rule-based IDS, Bloom filter-based IDS, random forest-based IDS, random subspace learning-based IDS, and deterministic finite automaton-based IDS. The informal and formal security analysis techniques used by the cyber security solutions are tabulated and summarized. In addition, we provide a taxonomy of attacks tackled by privacy-preserving and authentication solutions in the form of tables. Based on the present study, several proposals for challenges and research issues such as detecting false data injection attacks are discussed at the end of the paper. Authentication. Cyber security. Intrusion detection. SCADA. Smart grid. 
Cybersecurity and platform competition in the cloud. Cloud computing services are examples of platforms in the classic sense of the economics of two-sided markets. In particular, indirect externalities arise in the cloud from connecting users with developers of complementary products or services. The premise investigated here is that a cloud provider's security is subject to the same rigors of two-sided market competition that shape a cloud provider's pricing and strategy. In so doing, this study demonstrates how cybersecurity shapes cloud competition and cloud competition shapes cybersecurity. Specifically, cybersecurity is shown to be a user-side phenomenon with characteristics that can lead to the coexistence of cloud services providers rather than monopoly. In addition, a user's switching costs are characterized in terms of the ratio of the potential consequence of a class break under a user's current provider against that of the competition. Finally, a component of cybersecurity is identified for which there is no technical solution. 
Ethical Value-Centric Cybersecurity: A Methodology Based on a Value Graph. Our society is being shaped in a non-negligible way by the technological advances of recent years, especially in information and communications technologies (ICTs). The pervasiveness and democratization of ICTs have allowed people from all backgrounds to access and use them, which has resulted in new information-based assets. At the same time, this phenomenon has brought a new class of problems, in the form of activists, criminals and state actors that target the new assets to achieve their goals, legitimate or not. Cybersecurity includes the research, tools and techniques to protect information assets. However, some cybersecurity measures may clash with the ethical values of citizens.We analyze the synergies and tensions between some of these values, namely security, privacy, fairness and autonomy. From this analysis, we derive a value graph, and then we set out to identify those paths in the graph that lead to satisfying all four aforementioned values in the cybersecurity setting, by taking advantage of their synergies and avoiding their tensions. We illustrate our conceptual discussion with examples of enabling technologies. We also sketch how our methodology can be generalized to any setting where several potentially conflicting values have to be satisfied. Autonomy. Cybersecurity. Ethics. Fairness. Privacy. 
Cybersecurity Vulnerability Mitigation Framework through Empirical Paradigm (CyFEr): Prioritized Gap Analysis. Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools, frameworks, methodologies, and processes are commonly used to understand the cybersecurity maturity and posture of a system or a facility. Although those tools are strictly developed based on standards defined by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Energy, the majority of these tools and frameworks do not provide a platform to prioritize the requirements to reach a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we have been developing a framework and a software application called the cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). The efficacy of CyFEr was evaluated by implementing it on the NIST cybersecurity framework (CSF). This paper provides a detailed architecture of CyFEr and demonstrates its application to CSF by testing against a real-world cyberattack that targeted industrial control systems in a critical infrastructure facility.

Cybersecurity breaches and cash holdings: Spillover effect. This paper shows that firms significantly increase cash holdings after they have experienced a cybersecurity attack, and this behavior persists for years. A cyberattack increases cash holdings from a base level of 23% of assets to 26.87%. Similar firms, defined by industry and geographical proximity also increase their cash holdings. Suppliers of attacked firms are also affected. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the detrimental effects of a cybersecurity breach are not isolated to the attacked firms, and peer firms are quick to follow in taking precaution.

Cybersecurity Framework for IIoT-Based Power System Connected to Microgrid. Compared to the past infrastructure networks, the current smart grid network can improve productivity and management efficiency. However, as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Internet-based standard communication protocol is used, external network contacts are created, which is accompanied by security vulnerabilities from various perspectives. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop an appropriate cybersecurity guideline that enables effective reactions to cybersecurity threats caused by the abuse of such defects. Unfortunately, it is not easy for each organization to develop an adequate cybersecurity guideline. Thus, the cybersecurity checklist proposed by a government organization is used. The checklist does not fully reflect the characteristics of each infrastructure network. In this study, we proposed a cybersecurity framework that reflects the characteristics of a microgrid network in the IIoT environment, and performed an analysis to validate the proposed framework.

Out to explore the cybersecurity planet. Purpose: Security ceremonies still fail despite decades of efforts by researchers and practitioners. Attacks are often a cunning amalgam of exploits for technical systems and of forms of human behaviour. For example, this is the case with the recent news headline of a large-scale attack against Electrum Bitcoin wallets, which manages to spread a malicious update of the wallet app. The author therefore sets out to look at things through a different lens. Design/methodology/approach: The author makes the (metaphorical) hypothesis that humans arrived on Earth along with security ceremonies from a very far planet, the Cybersecurity planet. The author’s hypothesis continues, in that studying (by huge telescopes) the surface of Cybersecurity in combination with the logical projection on that surface of what happens on Earth is beneficial for us earthlings. Findings: The author has spotted four cities so far on the remote planet. Democratic City features security ceremonies that allow humans to follow personal paths of practice and, for example, make errors or be driven by emotions. By contrast, security ceremonies in Dictatorial City compel to comply, hence humans here behave like programmed automata. Security ceremonies in Beautiful City are so beautiful that humans just love to follow them precisely. Invisible City has security ceremonies that are not perceivable, hence humans feel like they never encounter any. Incidentally, the words democratic and dictatorial are used without any political connotation. Originality/value: A key argument the author shall develop is that all cities but Democratic City address the human factor, albeit in different ways. In the light of these findings, the author will also discuss security ceremonies of our planet, such as WhatsApp Web login and flight boarding, and explore room for improving them based upon the current understanding of Cybersecurity.

Improving employees’ intellectual capacity for cybersecurity through evidence-based malware training. Purpose: An organization’s ability to successfully manage intellectual capital is determined by the actions of its employees to prevent or minimize information security incidents. To prevent more data breaches to intellectual capital, organizations must provide regular cybersecurity awareness training for all personnel. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of different evidence-based cybersecurity training methods on employees’ cybersecurity risk perception and self-reported behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The study participants were randomly assigned into four groups (i.e. malware report, malware videos, both malware report and malware videos and no interventions) to assess the effects of cybersecurity training on their perceptions of vulnerability, severity, self-efficacy, security intention as well as their self-reported cybersecurity behaviors. Findings: The results show that evidence-based malware report is a relatively better training method in affecting employees’ intentions of engaging in recommended cybersecurity behaviors comparing with the other training methods used in this study. A closer analysis suggests whether the training method contains self-relevant information could make a difference to the training effects. Originality/value: This paper reports an in-depth investigation on how different evidence-based cybersecurity training methods impact employees’ perceptions of susceptibility, severity, self-efficacy, security intention as well as on their self-reported cybersecurity behaviors.

Seeking economic cyber security: a Middle Eastern example. Purpose: The transformation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) into an important global economic player has been accompanied by digitalization that has also left it at a risk to cybercrime. Concurrent with the rise in technology use, the UAE fast became one of the most targeted countries in the world. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the UAE has tried to cope with accelerating levels of cyber threat using legislative and regulatory efforts as well as public- and private-sector initiatives meant to raise cybersecurity awareness. Design/methodology/approach: The paper surveys the UAE’s cybersecurity legislative, regulatory and educational initiatives from 2003 to 2019. Findings: Because the human factor still remains the number one reason for security breaches, robust cyber laws alone are not enough to protect against cyber threats. Building public awareness and educating internet users about cyber risks and safety have become essential components of the UAE's efforts in building a more secure cyber environment for the country. Research limitations/implications: The paper relies on English-language translations of primary sources (laws) originally in Arabic, as well as English-language studies from local media. This should not be considered a problem, as English is established as the language of business and commerce in the UAE. Practical implications: The paper provides a detailed overview of the country’s cybersecurity environment to guide and aide practitioners with risk assessment and legal and regulatory compliance. Originality/value: The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the UAE’s cybersecurity legislative, regulatory and educational environment. It also surveys government and private sector initiatives directed in protecting the country’s cyberspace. Cybercrime. Cybersecurity. Laws. Regulations. United Arab Emirates. 
National challenges for cybersecurity on a global level: An analysis for colombia [Desafíos nacionales frente a la ciberseguridad en el escenario global: Un análisis para Colombia]. This article covers the topic of information security in light of cybersecurity threats in a global context, reviewing the current situation in Colombia. A historical walk-through on cybersecurity was performed through qualitative, theoretical, documentary and descriptive research (cyberwar, cyberdefense, computer crime), particularly in the component of information security. In addition, various aspects in that regard were worked on (contexts, risk analyses, management systems and quality standards), while risks to businesses, society and countries are shown, demonstrated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In the case of Colombia, data on government action in light of these threats were reviewed and its information security policies and quality standards were researched.

Healthcare Challenges in the Era of Cybersecurity. As a result of the extensive integration of technology into the healthcare system, cybersecurity incidents have become an increasing challenge for the healthcare industry. Recent examples include WannaCry, a nontargeted ransomware attack on more than 150 countries worldwide that temporarily crippled parts of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, and the 2016 ransomware attack on Los Angeles's Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. The attacks cost millions of dollars in lost revenue and fines, as well as significant reputational damage. Efforts are needed to devise tools that allow experts to more accurately quantify the actual impact of such events on both individual patients and healthcare systems as a whole. While the United States has robust disaster preparedness and response systems integrated throughout the healthcare and government sectors, the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat against healthcare entities is outpacing existing countermeasures and challenges in the all-hazards disaster preparedness paradigm. Further epidemiologic research of clinical cybersecurity attacks and their effects on patient care and clinical outcomes is necessary to prevent and mitigate future attacks. Cybersecurity.

An Interledger Blockchain Platform for Cross-Border Management of Cybersecurity Information. Cybersecurity certification is a core notion to support the mitigation of cybersecurity risks of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). At the European Union (EU) level, the Cybersecurity Act establishes a common cybersecurity certification framework supporting the coexistence of different certification schemes across Member States. However, its realization needs to be sustained by technical approaches to enable ICT stakeholders from different sectors or countries to exchange cybersecurity information and evaluate the up-to-date security level of an ICT system throughout their lifecycle. Toward this end, we propose a blockchain-based platform using a novel interledger design, where ledgers associated with ICT artifacts, cybersecurity certificates, and vulnerabilities are interconnected. The main purpose is to leverage the advantages of blockchain in terms of distributed trust, transparency, and accountability, while at the same time coping with scalability, performance, and interoperability requirements. We analyze the impact of our platform in the current EU legislation and provide insights for its deployment. Blockchain. Cybersecurity Certification. Interledger. 
Efficient distributed preprocessing model for machine learning-based anomaly detection over large-scale cybersecurity datasets. New computational and technological paradigms that currently guide developments in the information society, i.e., Internet of things, pervasive technology, or Ubicomp, favor the appearance of new intrusion vectors that can directly affect people's daily lives. This, together with advances in techniques and methods used for developing new cyber-attacks, exponentially increases the number of cyber threats which affect the information society. Because of this, the development and improvement of technology that assists cybersecurity experts to prevent and detect attacks arose as a fundamental pillar in the field of cybersecurity. Specifically, intrusion detection systems are now a fundamental tool in the provision of services through the internet. However, these systems have certain limitations, i.e., false positives, real-time analytics, etc., which require their operation to be supervised. Therefore, it is necessary to offer architectures and systems that favor an efficient analysis of the data handled by these tools. In this sense, this paper presents a new model of data preprocessing based on a novel distributed computing architecture focused on large-scale datasets such as UGR'16. In addition, the paper analyzes the use of machine learning techniques in order to improve the response and efficiency of the proposed preprocessing model. Thus, the solution developed achieves good results in terms of computer performance. Finally, the proposal shows the adequateness of decision tree algorithms for training a machine learning model by using a large dataset when compared with a multilayer perceptron neural network.

A holistic cybersecurity maturity assessment framework for higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. As organisations are vulnerable to cyberattacks, their protection becomes a significant issue. Capability Maturity Models can enable organisations to benchmark current maturity levels against best practices. Although many maturity models have been already proposed in the literature, a need for models that integrate several regulations exists. This article presents a light, web-based model that can be used as a cybersecurity assessment tool for Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) of the United Kingdom. The novel Holistic Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Framework incorporates all security regulations, privacy regulations, and best practices that HEIs must be compliant to, and can be used as a self assessment or a cybersecurity audit tool.

IntruDTree: A machine learning based cyber security intrusion detection model. Cyber security has recently received enormous attention in today's security concerns, due to the popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the tremendous growth of computer networks, and the huge number of relevant applications. Thus, detecting various cyber-attacks or anomalies in a network and building an effective intrusion detection system that performs an essential role in today's security is becoming more important. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree (IntruDTree) machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features. This model is not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy for unseen test cases but also minimizes the computational complexity of the model by reducing the feature dimensions. Finally, the effectiveness of our IntruDTree model was examined by conducting experiments on cybersecurity datasets and computing the precision, recall, fscore, accuracy, and ROC values to evaluate. We also compare the outcome results of IntruDTree model with several traditional popular machine learning methods such as the naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor, to analyze the effectiveness of the resulting security model.

Research trends in cybersecurity education: A bibliometric study [Tendencias investigativas en educación en ciberseguridad: Un estudio bibliométrico]. Cybersecurity becomes relevant from an educational perspective, for the understanding of current technological advances, and the development of new ones in order to meet the challenges of the future. This paper presents the findings through a bibliometric study developed on academic publications made on cybersecurity education as a topic of interest. This analysis aims to show the growth and validity of this topic over the years, as well as to analyze the dissemination and impact that these investigations have through their authors, magazines and countries that promote it. This is done with the use of quantity and quality indicators that help to make a journey on the development of the topic by integrating the areas of knowledge and associated research trends, which leaves an overview of what has been developing in recent years and its applications in different sectors.

The importance of cybersecurity education in school. Despite the fact that the Internet has positively impacted people’s lives, there are negative issues emerged related to the use of Internet. Cases like cyber-bully, online fraud, racial abuse, pornography and gambling had increased tremendously due to the lack of awareness and self-mechanism among Internet users to protect themselves from being victims to these acts. However, past research revealed that the level of awareness among Internet users is still low or moderate. One of the vital measures to be taken is to cultivate knowledge and awareness among Internet users from their early age, i.e., young children. Young children specifically, need to be educated to operate in a safe manner in cyberspace and to protect themselves in the process. The objective of this systematic review paper is to explore why it is so critical that modern learners are educated about the risks associated with being active in cyberspace and the strategies that stakeholders can use to promote cyber security education in schools. In this paper, few strategies are discussed as how cyber security education can be implemented in schools. Cyber awareness. Cyber education. Cyber safety. Cybersecurity. 
System log clustering approaches for cyber security applications: A survey. Log files give insight into the state of a computer system and enable the detection of anomalous events relevant to cyber security. However, automatically analyzing log data is difficult since it contains massive amounts of unstructured and diverse messages collected from heterogeneous sources. Therefore, several approaches that condense or summarize log data by means of clustering techniques have been proposed. Picking the right approach for a particular application domain is, however, non-trivial, since algorithms are designed towards specific objectives and requirements. This paper therefore surveys existing approaches. It thereby groups approaches by their clustering techniques, reviews their applicability and limitations, discusses trends and identifies gaps. The survey reveals that approaches usually pursue one or more of four major objectives: overview and filtering, parsing and signature extraction, static outlier detection, and sequences and dynamic anomaly detection. Finally, this paper also outlines a concept and tool that support the selection of appropriate approaches based on user-defined requirements. Anomaly detection. Cyber security. Log clustering.

Knowledge absorption for cyber-security: The role of human beliefs. We investigate how human beliefs are associated with the absorption of specialist knowledge that is required to produce cyber-security. We ground our theorizing in the knowledge-based view of the firm and transaction-cost economics. We test our hypotheses with a sample of 262 members of an information-sharing and analysis center who share sensitive information related to cyber-security. Our findings suggest that resource belief, usefulness belief, and reciprocity belief are all positively associated with knowledge absorption, whereas reward belief is not. The implications of these findings for practitioners and future research are discussed. Cyber-security. Information sharing. Knowledge absorption. Knowledge-based view. Organizational learning.

Technological Change in the Retirement Transition and the Implications for Cybersecurity Vulnerability in Older Adults. Retirement is a major life transition, which leads to substantial changes across almost all aspects of day-to-day life. Although this transition has previously been seen as the normative marker for entry into older adulthood, its influence on later life has remained relatively unstudied in terms of technology use and cybersecurity behaviours. This is problematic as older adults are at particular risk of becoming victims of cyber-crime. This study aimed to investigate which factors associated with the retirement transition were likely to increase vulnerability to cyber-attack in a sample of 12 United Kingdom based older adults, all of whom had retired within the past 5 years. Semi-structured, one to one interviews were conducted and subsequently analysed using thematic analysis. Six themes were identified referring to areas of loss in: social interaction, finances, day-to-day routine, feelings of competence, sense of purpose, and technology support structures. We discuss the implications of these losses for building cyber-resilience in retirees, with suggestions for future research. ageing. cybersecurity. HCI. older adults. retirement transition. 
Cyber security threats, challenges and defence mechanisms in cloud computing. With the advent of computers and their widespread use, cloud computing has been identified as one of the major emerging components of computer technology. The benefits of cloud computing, in the form of processing power and computing resources connected via the internet, have not only bolstered business and personal operations of users but have also led to severe security and privacy threats that require adaptation into cloud computing systems. In light of this, the present study explores the various threats to cloud computing, in addition to outlining defence mechanisms against these threats. It was found that there is a major threat concerning data breaches because of the lack of management understanding of the use of cloud computing services and their defence mechanisms. Furthermore, there can be an abuse of cloud computing services that, in turn, affect not only sensitive data pertaining to the organisation but also the personal identity and information of the user. 
Cyber security against ddos, malware, spoofing attacks using machine learning with genetic algorithm. The cyber security is a practice measure to prevent the data online. Worldwide lock down period amid COVID19 crisis resulting high gain in online users and data processing along with transactions, confidential information is required to be prevented from any kind of misuse. Implementing effective cyber security measures has become difficult task as today there are more devices than people. This paper presents a new approach using extended Genetic Algorithm for the selection of attributes followed by neural training and classification for three different cyber threats namely Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), malware and spoofing.

A review of challenges on cyber security and latest mechanism. Internet is basic need of our life. It has changed the way of our communication. Undoubtedly, Internet is best resource for us and we can do much more with it. Here, the question arises of safety. Are we safe on Internet? The answer of this question may be yes, if we are little bit aware and using right tools. During the use of internet many types of viruses, malware and worms may infect our computer. So we always need to be careful about the program which we download or run on our computer. Internet users are increasing day by day. So many new tools and technologies are emerging and being used most frequently. As we live in our houses and keep it safe from thieves. In the same way, if we use internet then we have to keep safe ourselves from internet thieves. Keeping safe ourselves from internet thieves is cyber safety. In this paper, we'll survey the challenges of cyber security. Cyber challenges. Cyber crime. Cyber safety. Internet users. 
Cyber-security effect on organizational internal process: Mediating role of technological infrastructure. Adopting the technologies among organizations comes with the continuous worries of protection and hacking. The idea of cyber-security has become over the years the main interest of many organizations, which depend on technologies in its operations, which requires them to pay extra attention to their technological infrastructure. The current study aims at examining the influence of cyber-security forces on organizational internal operations and the role of technological infrastructure in defining and controlling the level of protection that cyber-security has on organizational internal processes. Quantitative approach was adopted, and a questionnaire was utilized to collect the data from a convenient sample of 360 software engineers, network engineers, software testers, web developers, and technical support using a structured survey questionnaire, and analyzed using SPSS version 21. The results confirmed that cyber-security motivators (data growth, technology expansion, access to required resources, operational control, and technical control) indirectly affect solid internal processes that are attributed to the consistency of technological infrastructure in an organization. The variable of 'data growth' appeared to be the most influential motivator on cyber-security strategies, as it scored a mean of 4.2661, which is the highest among all adopted variables and followed by the variable of 'technical control', which scored a mean of 4.1296. Accordingly, the study recommends that organizations should consider IT infrastructure as a main item within their risk management strategies to avoid unpredicted risks and attacks. Cyber-security.

The Governance of Turkey’s Cyberspace: Between Cyber Security and Information Security. This article explores Turkey’s multifaceted cyberspace governance policy and argues that positioned between two opposites of cyberspace governance that has close military and security ties to the West, and domestic Internet policies more similar of Russia-China axis, Turkey should be considered as a swing state in global cyberspace governance debates. The article shows that despite her official discourse on multi-stakeholderism and its compliance with the emerging norms in the Euro-Atlantic alliance concerning cyber-security, cyber-crime, and cyber-defense. Turkey’s domestic Internet policy converges towards the Russia-China axis characterized by the rise of information controls and increasing efforts to establish digital sovereignty to national cyber space. cyber-security policy. cyberspace governance. information security. internet policy. swing states.

Improving the quality of the internet of things instruction in technology management, cybersecurity, and computer science. Many universities require end of course evaluations for all courses taught as tool for academic accreditation purposes. The reality is that often many academic departments either do not do anything or have no idea what to do when evaluations continue to be poor. As a result, students have fought back against this process to create their own on-line rating program, Rate My Professor.com, which allows students to give other students insights into who is a quality professor and who is not. This paper explores this use of mock teaching simulations, which are also called Micro-teaching approaches, as a quality management tool to improve the way students are taught in Technology Management, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science degree and certificate programs.

Compliance with new UNECE cyber security regulations by using a digital twin of the car Digitization in the automotive industry makes cyber security a focus topic for vehicle software updates – international regulatory bodies are currently working on security guidelines. For vehicle manufacturers, this means that they have to establish processes and systems in accordance with the new cyber security requirements as quickly as possible. Digital Twin Computing can provide significant support in this area. The new Digital Twin Computing initiative from Japan is going beyond the traditional understanding of Digital Twin. 
Towards the design of a collaborative cybersecurity networked organisation: Identification and prioritisation of governance needs and objectives. The effective response to the proliferation and growing diversity and sophistication of cyber threats requires a broad spectrum of competencies, human, technological and financial resources that are in the powers of very few countries. The European Union is addressing this challenge through an initiative to establish one or more cybersecurity competence networks. A number of existing technologies can support collaboration in networked organisations. however, network governance remains a challenge. The study presented in this article aimed to identify and prioritise network governance issues. Towards that purpose, qualitative and quantitative methods were applied in the analysis of norms and regulations, statutory documents of existing networks, academic sources and interviews with representatives of funding organisations and potential major customers. The comprehensiveness and complementarity of these primary sources allowed to identify 33 categories of governance issues and group them in four tiers, indicative of the respective priority level. The results of the study are currently used to inform and orient the development of alternative models for governance of a cybersecurity network and a set of criteria for their evaluation. They will support informed decision-making on the most appropriate governance model of a future networked organisation, evolving from a project consortium. Collaborative networked organisation.

Cybersecurity Challenges from the Perspective of Emergence [涌现视角下的网络空间安全挑战]. The security in the cyberspace undoubtedly belongs to emergent properties in nature. This kind of emergent properties brings about severe challenges to cybersecurity. A number of efforts of research on emergent phenomena related to the security in the cyberspace have been seen both home and abroad. Up till now, a lot of significant results have been achieved by this kind of research. However, people's knowledge of emergence in cybersecurity is still far from sufficient. For this situation, the challenges to cybersecurity are observed systemically from the perspective of emergence to promote the development of innovative ideas and theories in cybersecurity. At first, fundamental concepts of emergence in cybersecurity are revealed based on the original meaning of emergence in systems science. Secondly, challenges of emergent security to the cyberspace are explored with consideration to attacks, vulnerabilities, and defenses. Then, the state-of-the-art of research on the emergence of security in the cyberspace is analyzed in a way that it has been divided into three categories, which include descriptive research, directive research, and operational research. Finally, with the focus on fundamental theories, basic models, and practical tools, discussions are made to answer the question about how to further the study in the future in the field of emergent security in the cyberspace.

Cyber Security Threat Intelligence Sharing Model Based on Blockchain [基于区块链的网络安全威胁情报共享模型]. In the process of increasing cyber security attack and defense confrontation, there is a natural asymmetry between the offensive and defensive sides. The CTI (cyber security threat intelligence) sharing is an effective method to improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of the protection party. However, there is a contradiction between the privacy protection requirements of CTI sharing and the need to build a complete attack chain. Aiming at the above contradiction, this paper proposes a blockchain-based CTI sharing model, which uses the account anonymity of the blockchain technology to protect the privacy of CTI sharing party, and at the same time utilizes the tamper-free and accounting of the blockchain technology to prevent the free-riding behavior in CTI sharing and guarantee the benefit of CTI sharing party. The one-way encryption function is used to protect the private information in CTI, then the model uses the encrypted CTI to build a complete attack chain, and uses the traceability of the blockchain technology to complete the decryption of the attack source in the attack chain. The smart contract mechanism of the blockchain technology is used to implement an automated early warning and response against cyber security threats. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by simulation experiments. Attack chain. Blockchain. Cyber security. Cyber security threat intelligence.

Uncovering the cyber security challenges in healthcare. The now infamous WannaCry hack of May 2017 not only sent shockwaves through the healthcare industry in the UK, but also caused cyber security concerns to understandably balloon across all sectors. It made people sit up and question the extent to which large, household name organisations like the National Health Service were acting to protect the critical data held about individuals under their care. 
Cyber Security Threats and Vulnerabilities: A Systematic Mapping Study. There has been a tremendous increase in research in the area of cyber security to support cyber applications and to avoid key security threats faced by these applications. The goal of this study is to identify and analyze the common cyber security vulnerabilities. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was conducted, and in total, 78 primary studies were identified and analyzed. After a detailed analysis of the selected studies, we identified the important security vulnerabilities and their frequency of occurrence. Data were also synthesized and analyzed to present the venue of publication, country of publication, key targeted infrastructures and applications. The results show that the security approaches mentioned so far only target security in general, and the solutions provided in these studies need more empirical validation and real implementation. In addition, our results show that most of the selected studies in this review targeted only a few common security vulnerabilities such as phishing, denial-of-service and malware. However, there is a need, in future research, to identify the key cyber security vulnerabilities, targeted/victimized applications, mitigation techniques and infrastructures, so that researchers and practitioners could get a better insight into it.

Cybersecurity compliance behavior: Exploring the influences of individual decision style and other antecedents. Recent information and cybersecurity research have focused on improving individuals’ security compliance behavior. However, improved security performance remains a challenge since individuals often fail to comply with security best practices. In this study, we investigate a new individual cybersecurity compliance behavior model proposed by Donalds and Osei-Bryson (2017). Specifically, we investigate the influence of individual decision styles on their cybersecurity compliance behavior and other antecedents of such behavior. To empirically validate the hypotheses in the Donalds & Osei-Bryson model, we used data collected from 248 individuals and then use multiple regression to examine the assertions of the model. Our findings confirm that individual's decision styles, specifically, dominant orientation and dominant decision style, influence their individual cybersecurity compliance behavior and other antecedents of such behavior. Our research offers new dimensions for investigating individual cybersecurity compliance behavior and new insights into factors that may influence individual's cybersecurity compliance behavior.

Cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm: Enhanced prioritized gap analysis. Existing cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools were designed based on the policies and standards defined by organizations such as the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Frameworks such as the cybersecurity capability maturity model (C2M2) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are often used by the critical infrastructure owners and operators to determine the cybersecurity maturity of their facility. Although these frameworks are exceptional at performing qualitative cybersecurity analysis and identifying vulnerabilities, they do not provide a means to perform prioritized mitigation of those vulnerabilities in order to achieve a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we developed a framework and software application called the cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). This paper presents the detailed architecture of CyFEr's enhanced prioritized gap analysis (EPGA) methodology and its application to CSF. The efficacy of the presented framework is demonstrated by comparing against existing similar models and testing against the cyber injects from a real-world cyber-attack that targeted industrial control systems (ICS) in critical infrastructures.

Multilateral cybersecurity governance: Divergent conceptualizations and its origin. Conventional wisdom holds that none of the main global challenges of the 21st century—whether it is climate change, nuclear weapons or cyber insecurity—can be adequately addressed without proper international cooperation. However, multilateral cooperation in many issue areas including cybersecurity is in a state of gridlock. Diverging conceptualizations of the subject matter has been offered as one driving factor behind the difficulty to cooperate at the international level. This paper contends that while international cooperation in cybersecurity has been difficult because of diverging definitions and conceptualizations of the subject, which are apparent in the international system, the problem grew into a state of gridlock because this divergence is anchored in the incompatibility of the ways in which major cyber powers organize their respective political systems at home. As such, it is argued that, the role of the multilateral system to bring about any significant progress in cybersecurity governance is very limited. 
Cybersecurity investments in the supply chain: Coordination and a strategic attacker. Cybersecurity poses a difficult challenge to supply chains, as a firm may be affected by an attack on another firm in the supply chain. For example, a retailer's consumer data might be compromised via an attack on a supplier. In general, individual nodes in a supply chain bear the entire cost of their own cybersecurity investments, but some of the benefits of the investments may be enjoyed by the other nodes as well. We analyze the differences between coordinated and uncoordinated cybersecurity investments, as well as the differences resulting from a strategic and a non-strategic attacker. We find that lack of coordination leads to underinvestment with a non-strategic attacker, but that this is somewhat counterbalanced by an attacker being strategic. Lack of coordination may lead to either underinvestment or overinvestment with a strategic attacker, depending on how large the indirect damages from attacks are relative to the direct damages. overinvestment is more likely if indirect damages are relatively minor. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the impacts of and relationships between coordinated investments and a strategic attacker. Attacker-defender model. Cybersecurity.

Cyber-security on smart grid: Threats and potential solutions. The smart grid is one of the most significant applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). As information and communication technologies (ICT) developed and applied in traditional power systems, the improvement of smart grid cyber-physical-systems (CPS) increases too. IoT-based smart grid systems are critical infrastructures, also they have complex architectures and include critical devices. They contain communication systems that can lead to national security deficits, disruption of public order, loss of life or large-scale economic damage when the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the communication is broken down. These huge systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is a lot of research effort to enhance smart grid security in industry, government, and academia. The security approaches are important to improve solutions against cyber-attacks in smart grid applications. We present a comprehensive survey supported by a wide review of earlier work. Additionally, recent advances and countermeasures are presented on smart grid cyber-security. In this paper, the threats and potential solutions of the IoT-based smart grid are analyzed. We focus on cyber-attack types and provide an in-depth of the cyber-security state of the smart grid. Particularly, we concentrate on the discussion and examination of network vulnerabilities, attack countermeasures, and security requirements. We aim to supply a deep understanding of cyber-security vulnerabilities and solutions and give a guide on future research directions for cyber-security in smart grid applications. Cyber-attacks.

An Exploratory Study Into the Negotiation of Cyber-Security Within the Family Home. Given the increasingly young age that children are using technology and accessing the internet and its associated risks, it is important we understand how families manage and negotiate cyber-security within the home. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with thirteen families (14 parents and 19 children) in the south-west of the United Kingdom about their main cyber-security concerns and management strategies. Thematic analysis of the results revealed that families were concerned about cyberbullying, online stranger danger, privacy, content, financial scams, and technical threats. Both parents and children drew on family, friends and trusted others as resources, and used a variety of strategies to manage these threats including rules and boundaries around technology, using protective functions of technology, communication and education around safety. There were tensions between parents and children over boundaries, potentially putting families at risk if children break household rules around cyber-security. Finally, parents expressed the feeling they were in a ‘whole new world’ of cyber-security threats, and that positive and negative aspects of technology must be constantly balanced. However, parents also felt that the challenges in managing family security are the same ones that have always faced parents – it is just that the context is now digital as well as physical. communication. cyber-security. family. negotiation. qualitative interviews. security. technology. 
Cybersecurity assurance in the emerging manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS) paradigm: A lesson from the video streaming industry. The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has incapacitated physical supply chains of various industrial sectors. This has been a call for attention to rethinking innovative methods to improve supply chain resilience. Emerging manufacturing technologies like additive/hybrid manufacturing are enabling small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to transform into cybermanufacturing kiosks that deliver manufacturing-as-a-service by digitizing much of the manufacturing workflow (design, communication, and manufacturing). This transformation is causing a paradigm shift in which major producers and original equipment manufacturers can outsource manufacturing of components to distributed SMEs located near the point of need. The increasing reliance on a digital thread would reduce the burden of resiliency required from the physical supply chains. Although digital threads are reducing the burden on the physical supply chains, they introduce a new class of cyber-resilience requirements, chiefly in ensuring the integrity of the designs and other intellectual properties shared across the digital thread. A novel design-sharing scheme for the digital thread based on video streaming is introduced herein to address the issue of IP theft and tampering. The potential of design-sharing schemes for the improvement of the cyberresilience of digital supply chains is discussed. Copyright . Circular buffer. Cybersecurity. File sharing.

Cybersecurity regulation in the financial sector: Prospects of legal harmonization in the European Union and beyond. Over the past several years, the cybersecurity regulatory landscape has undergone unprecedented change. Bespoke cybersecurity laws and regulations have replaced pre-existing general risk management and business continuity rules in a number of jurisdictions, including the European Union, Hong Kong, Russia, the USA, and Singapore. Cybersecurity has also become the focus of international rules and recommendations adopted by numerous international organizations. The financial sector lies at the centre of the new regulatory initiatives - which, in the absence of an agreed international approach, vary substantially across jurisdictions. This article analyses these emerging legal frameworks by (i) conducting a comparative study of the novel cybersecurity regulations in finance. (ii) identifying the common features of such frameworks. and (iii) assessing the prospect of their harmonization at an international level. It argues that international harmonization in this area is necessary to overcome the underlying regulatory challenges and outlines the scope of rules amenable, first, to initial (de minimis) and, second, subsequent (more expansive) harmonization. The article concludes with a list of main upcoming challenges in designing and harmonizing cybersecurity regulations in finance and practical recommendations for overcoming them. 
Cybersecurity benefits and resilience of ports.

FastText-based local feature visualization algorithm for merged image-based malware classification framework for cyber security and cyber defense. The importance of cybersecurity has recently been increasing. A malware coder writes malware into normal executable files. A computer is more likely to be infected by malware when users have easy access to various executables. Malware is considered as the starting point for cyber-attacks. thus, the timely detection, classification and blocking of malware are important. Malware visualization is a method for detecting or classifying malware. A global image is visualized through binaries extracted from malware. The overall structure and behavior of malware are considered when global images are utilized. However, the visualization of obfuscated malware is tough, owing to the difficulties encountered when extracting local features. This paper proposes a merged image-based malware classification framework that includes local feature visualization, global image-based local feature visualization, and global and local image merging methods. This study introduces a fastText-based local feature visualization method: First, local features such as opcodes and API function names are extracted from the malware. second, important local features in each malware family are selected via the term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm. third, the fastText model embeds the selected local features. finally, the embedded local features are visualized through a normalization process. Malware classification based on the proposed method using the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset was experimentally verified. The accuracy of the proposed method was approximately 99.65%, which is 2.18% higher than that of another contemporary global image-based approach. Cyber security. Deep learning.

Interoperability challenges in the cybersecurity information sharing ecosystem. Threat intelligence helps businesses and organisations make the right decisions in their fight against cyber threats, and strategically design their digital defences for an optimised and up-to-date security situation. Combined with advanced security analysis, threat intelligence helps reduce the time between the detection of an attack and its containment. This is achieved by continuously providing information, accompanied by data, on existing and emerging cyber threats and vulnerabilities affecting corporate networks. This paper addresses challenges that organisations are bound to face when they decide to invest in effective and interoperable cybersecurity information sharing and categorises them in a layered model. Based on this, it provides an evaluation of existing sources that share cybersecurity information. The aim of this research is to help organisations improve their cyber threat information exchange capabilities, to enhance their security posture and be more prepared against emerging threats.

A comprehensive insight into game theory in relevance to cyber security. The progressively ubiquitous connectivity in the present information systems pose newer challenges to security. The conventional security mechanisms have come a long way in securing the well-defined objectives of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability. Nevertheless, with the growth in the system complexities and attack sophistication, providing security via traditional means are increasingly becoming unachievable. A novel theoretical perspective and an innovative approach are thus required for understanding security from a decision-making and strategic viewpoint. One of the analytical tools which may assist the researchers in designing security protocols for computer networks is game theory. The game-theoretic concept finds extensive applications in security at different levels, including the cyberspace and is generally categorized under security games. It can be utilized as a robust mathematical tool for modelling and analyzing contemporary security issues. Game theory offers a natural framework for capturing the defensive as well as adversarial interactions between the defenders and the attackers. Furthermore, defenders can attain a deep understanding of the potential attack threats and the strategies of attackers by equilibrium evaluation of the security games. In this paper, the concept of game theory has been presented, followed by game-theoretic applications in cybersecurity, including cryptography. Different types of games, particularly those focused on securing the cyberspace, have been analysed and varied game-theoretic methodologies including mechanism design theories have been outlined for offering a modern foundation of the science of cybersecurity.

A novel stochastic model for cybersecurity metric inspired by markov chain model and attack graphs. Techniques for security analysis have historically focused on identifying threats, vulnerabilities in systems or components and proposing some risk mitigation. A great variety of graph-based algorithms have been proposed to generate attack graphs for security evaluation. Several cyber security metric classes have been proposed like core metrics, victimization structural metrics, probability-based metrics, and time-based metrics. These models measure the security failure of the system independently the variance of failure probability component, the impact of threats from one component to another. In this paper, a novel stochastic model was proposed to quantify the cyber security by combining time and probability. The proposed model is inspired by Markov Chain and the Attack Graphs metrics. A complementary suite of quantitative metrics was presented to aid the security engineer to evaluate the current state and to predict the future security of the system. Attack Graph. Cloud Computing.

Signs your cyber security is doomed to fail. Cybercrime represents big money for cyber criminals. Unfortunately, that will likely equate to significant operational and financial losses for unprepared businesses. While most enterprises have come to terms with the fact that a future security incident is inevitable, many still struggle to translate this into the right security architecture and mindset. One of the reasons is that too many organisations buy into some persistent misconceptions regarding cyber security. They also make some basic errors in their attitudes towards the threats and how their organisations should deal with them. Marcus Chung of BoldCloud Looks at seven of the most common problems that could indicate your business is at risk.

Natural language processing model for automatic analysis of cybersecurity-related documents. This paper describes the development and implementation of a natural language processing model based on machine learning which performs cognitive analysis for cybersecurity-related documents. A domain ontology was developed using a two-step approach: (1) the symmetry stage and (2) the machine adjustment. The first stage is based on the symmetry between the way humans represent a domain and the way machine learning solutions do. Therefore, the cybersecurity field was initially modeled based on the expertise of cybersecurity professionals. A dictionary of relevant entities was created. the entities were classified into 29 categories and later implemented as classes in a natural language processing model based on machine learning. After running successive performance tests, the ontology was remodeled from 29 to 18 classes. Using the ontology, a natural language processing model based on a supervised learning model was defined. We trained the model using sets of approximately 300,000 words. Remarkably, our model obtained an F1 score of 0.81 for named entity recognition and 0.58 for relation extraction, showing superior results compared to other similar models identified in the literature. Furthermore, in order to be easily used and tested, a web application that integrates our model as the core component was developed. Cybersecurity. Machine learning. Named entity recognition.

Managing IoT Cyber-Security Using Programmable Telemetry and Machine Learning. Cyber-security risks for Internet of Things (IoT) devices sourced from a diversity of vendors and deployed in large numbers, are growing rapidly. Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle). (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces. and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks). device monitoring. flow characteristics.

Integrating cybersecurity in hazard and risk analyses. As operational and information technologies converge to allow for remote and real-time access to plant operating data and control functions, the process industry could become increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks. Traditional hazard and risk analysis methods appear inadequate to identify, prevent, and mitigate such attacks. This paper discusses the significance of incorporating cybersecurity vulnerability analysis not just as part of process hazard analysis (PHA), but also in terms of protecting the process control network and implementing adequate safeguards in general against cyber threats. A layer of protection analysis (LOPA) is adapted to evaluate potential weaknesses and ensure safeguards for critical applications would be resistant to cyber-attacks. Integrating cybersecurity into hazard and risk analyses as well as other elements of process safety management (PSM) is demonstrated with examples, making the plant more resilient against both traditional and cyber threats. 
An effective cybersecurity exercises platform cyexec and its training contents. Recently the threats of cyberattacks, especially of targeted attacks are increasing rapidly and a large number of cybersecurity incidents are occurring frequently. On the other hand, capable personnel are greatly lacking, and strengthen the systematic human resource development cultivating capabilities for cybersecurity activities is becoming an urgent issue. However, only a few parts of academia and private sector in Japan can carry out the cybersecurity exercises because of high cost and inflexibility of commercial or existing training software. On this account, in order to enforce cybersecurity practical exercises cost-effectively and flexibly, we developed a virtual environment Cybersecurity Exercises (CyExec) system utilizing VirtualBox and Docker. We also implemented an open source vulnerability scanner tool WebGoat and our original cyberattack and defense training contents on CyExec. Cyber range exercise. Cyberattack and defense exercise.

From Static to Dynamic Anomaly Detection with Application to Power System Cyber Security. Developing advanced diagnosis tools to detect cyber attacks is the key to security of power systems. It has been shown that multivariate data injection attacks can bypass bad data detection schemes typically built on static behavior of the systems, which misleads operators to disruptive decisions. In this article, we depart from the existing static viewpoint to develop a diagnosis filter that captures the dynamics signatures of such a multivariate intrusion. To this end, we introduce a dynamic residual generator approach formulated as robust optimization programs in order to detect a class of disruptive multivariate attacks that potentially remain stealthy in view of a static bad data detector. We investigate two possible desired features: (i) a non-zero transient and (ii) a non-zero steady-state behavior of the residual generator in the presence of an attack. In case (i), the problem is reformulated as a finite, but possibly non-convex, optimization program. We further develop a linear programming relaxation that improves the scalability, and as such practicality, of the diagnosis filter design. In case (ii), it turns out that the resulting robust program admits an exact convex reformulation, yielding a Nash equilibrium between the attacker and the residual generator. This assertion has an interesting implication: the proposed approach is not conservative in the sense that the additional knowledge of the worst-case attack does not improve the diagnosis performance. To illustrate our theoretical results, we implement the proposed diagnosis filter to detect multivariate attacks on the system measurements deployed to generate the so-called Automatic Generation Control signals in a three-area IEEE 39-bus system. diagnosis filter.

Enhancing Power System Cyber-Security with Systematic Two-Stage Detection Strategy. State estimation estimates the system condition in real-time and provides a base case for other energy management system (EMS) applications including real-time contingency analysis and security-constrained economic dispatch. Recent work in the literature shows malicious cyber-attack can inject false measurements that bypass traditional bad data detection in state estimation and cause actual overloads. Thus, it is very important to detect such cyber-attack. In this paper, multiple metrics are proposed to monitor abnormal load deviations and suspicious branch flow changes. A systematic two-stage approach is proposed to detect false data injection (FDI) cyber-attack. The first stage determines whether the system is under attack while the second stage identifies the target branch. Numerical simulations verify that FDI can cause severe system violations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage FDI detection (FDID) method. It is concluded that the proposed FDID approach can efficiently detect FDI cyber-attack and identify the target branch, which will substantially improve operators' situation awareness in real-time.

Risk as affect: The affect heuristic in cybersecurity. Risk perception is an important driver of netizens’ (Internet users’) cybersecurity behaviours, with a number of factors influencing its formation. It has been argued that the affect heuristic can be a source of variation in generic risk perception. However, a major shortcoming of the supporting research evidence for this assertion is that the central construct, affect, has not been measured or analysed. Moreover, its influence in the cybersecurity domain has not yet been tested. The contribution of the research reported in this paper is thus, firstly, to test the affect heuristic while measuring its three constructs: affect, perceived risk and perceived benefit and, secondly, to test its impact in the cybersecurity domain. By means of two carefully designed studies (N = 63 and N = 233), we provide evidence for the influence of the affect heuristic on risk perception in the cybersecurity domain. We conclude by identifying directions for future research into the role of affect and its impact on cybersecurity risk perception. Affect. Affect heuristic. Benefit perception. Cybersecurity.

PenQuest: a gamified attacker/defender meta model for cyber security assessment and education. Attacks on IT systems are a rising threat against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and infrastructures. At the same time, the complex interplay of attack techniques and possible countermeasures makes it difficult to appropriately plan, implement, and evaluate an organization’s defense. More often than not, the worlds of technical threats and organizational controls remain disjunct. In this article, we introduce PenQuest, a meta model designed to present a complete view on information system attacks and their mitigation while providing a tool for both semantic data enrichment and security education. PenQuest simulates time-enabled attacker/defender behavior as part of a dynamic, imperfect information multi-player game that derives significant parts of its ruleset from established information security sources such as STIX, CAPEC, CVE/CWE and NIST SP 800-53. Attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and mitigating controls are mapped to counterpart strategies and concrete actions through practical, data-centric mechanisms. The gamified model considers and defines a wide range of actors, assets, and actions, thereby enabling the assessment of cyber risks while giving technical experts the opportunity to explore specific attack scenarios in the context of an abstracted IT infrastructure. We implemented PenQuest as a physical serious game prototype and successfully tested it in a higher education environment. Additional expert interviews helped evaluate the model’s applicability to information security scenarios. Attack patterns. Awareness. Controls. Education. Game theory. Intrusion detection. Malware.

A review of generative adversarial networks and its application in cybersecurity. This paper reviews Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in detail by discussing the strength of the GAN when compared to other generative models, how GANs works and some of the notable problems with training, tuning and evaluating GANs. The paper also briefly reviews notable GAN architectures like the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN, with the aim of showing how design specifications in these architectures help solve some of the problems with the basic GAN model. All this is done with a view of discussing the application of GANs in cybersecurity studies. Here, the paper reviews notable cybersecurity studies where the GAN plays a key role in the design of a security system or adversarial system. In general, from the review, one can observe two major approaches these cybersecurity studies follow. In the first approach, the GAN is used to improve generalization to unforeseen adversarial attacks, by generating novel samples that resembles adversarial data which can then serve as training data for other machine learning models. In the second approach, the GAN is trained on data that contains authorized features with the goal of generating realistic adversarial data that can thus fool a security system. These two approaches currently guide the scope of modern cybersecurity studies with generative adversarial networks. Cybersecurity. Deep Learning. Generative adversarial networks. 
Vehicle Safe-Mode, Concept to Practice Limp-Mode in the Service of Cybersecurity. This article describes both a concept and an implementation of vehicle safe-mode (VSM) - a mechanism that may help reduce the damage of an identified cyberattack to the vehicle, its driver, the passengers, and its surroundings. Unlike other defense mechanisms that try to block the attack or simply notify of its existence, the VSM mechanism responds to a detected intrusion by limiting the vehicle's functionality to safe operations and optionally activating additional security countermeasures. This is done by adopting ideas from the existing mechanism of Limp-mode that was originally designed to limit the damage of a mechanical, or an electrical, malfunction and let the vehicle limp back homein safety. Like Limp-mode, the purpose of safe-mode is to limit the vehicle from performing certain functions when conditions arise that could render full operation dangerous: Detecting a malfunction in the Limp-mode case is analogous to detecting an active cybersecurity breach in the safe-mode case, and the reactions should be analogous as well. We demonstrate that the VSM can be implemented, possibly even as an aftermarket add-on: to do so we developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) system and actively tested it in real time on an operating vehicle. Once activated, our VSM system restricts the vehicle to Limp-mode behavior by guiding it to remain in low gear, taking into account the vehicle's speed and the driver's actions. Our system does not require any changes to the electronic control units (ECUs), or to any other part of the vehicle, beyond connecting the safe-mode manager (SMManager) to the correct bus. We note that our system can rely upon any deployed anomaly-detection system to identify the potential attack. We point out that restricting the vehicle to Limp-mode-like behavior by an aftermarket system is just an example. If a car manufacturer would integrate such a system into a vehicle, they would have many more options, and the resulting system would probably be safer and with a better human-machine interface.

Investors’ perceptions of the cybersecurity risk management reporting framework. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a research model to examine the perception of non-professional investors toward the cybersecurity reporting framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Design/methodology/approach: The proposed hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling with data collected from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Findings: The findings conclude that investors' perceived benefits of the cybersecurity risk framework are positively related to investment intention. Information quality and cybersecurity awareness also positively influence perceived benefits of the risk framework and investment intention. Practical implications: Findings of this study are relevant to both regulatory bodies and firms because non-professional investors’ perceptions of the benefits of the AICPA’s reporting framework are unveiled. Originality/value: Findings from this research help to provide a more in-depth understanding of the impact of various factors on investor’s decision-making process and also significant insights into the non-professional investor’s attitude toward the AICPA’s framework.

Cyber security risks in globalized supply chains: conceptual framework. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine cyber security risks in globalized supply chains (SCs). It has been seen to have a greater impact on the performance of SCs. The information and communication technology of a firm, which enhances the efficiency and effectiveness in the SC, could simultaneously be the cause of vulnerabilities and exposure to security threats. Researchers have primarily focussed on the cyber-physical system (CPS) vulnerabilities impacting SC. This paper tries to categorize the cyber security risks occurring because of the SCs operating in CPS. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the flow of information along the upstream and downstream SC, this paper tries to identify cyber security risks in the global SCs. It has further tried to categorize these cyber security risks from a strategic point of view. Findings: This paper tries to identify the various cyber security risk and cyber-attacks in globalized SC for improving the performance. The 16 cyber security risks have been categorized into three categories, namely, supply risk, operational risk and demand risk. The paper proposes a framework consisting of different cyber-attacks across the information that flows in global SCs along-with suitable mitigation strategies. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents the conceptual model of cyber security risks and cyber-attacks in globalized SCs based on literature review and industry experts. Further validation and scale development of these risks can be done through empirical study. Practical implications: This paper provides significant managerial insights by developing a framework for understanding the cyber security risks in terms of the drivers of these risks and how to deal with them. From a managerial perspective, this framework can be used as a decision-making process while considering different cyber security risks across the stages of globalized SCs. Originality/value: The major contribution of this study is the identification and categorization of cyber security risks across the global SCs in the digital age. Thus, this paper introduces a new phenomenon to the field of management that has the potential to investigate new areas of future research. Based on the categorization, the paper provides insights on how cyber security risks impact the continuity of SC operations. Cyber security risks. Cyber-physical system. Industry 4.0. Qualitative.

Cyber security simulation based on real-time simulation platform of cyber physical power system. Modem power systems have gradually developed into cyber physical power systems that deeply integrate information flow and energy flow. Traditional simulation methods that only operate on physical systems cannot guarantee the accuracy of the simulation analysis. From the perspective of simulation analysis, on the basis of a comparative analysis of existing simulation methods, this paper makes improvements in simulation tools and coordination modes, and further adds a man-in-the-middle link to build a new CPPS real-time co-simulation platform considering cyber-attacks. Finally, the impact of cyber-attacks on the power physical system is studied with the example of load control business on this platform, and the deep coupling relationship between cyber system and physical system of CPPS is analyzed in detail. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed platform. Cyber physical system. Cyber security. Distributed control. Simulation platform. 
Cybersecurity threats based on machine learning-based offensive technique for password authentication. Due to the emergence of online society, a representative user authentication method that is password authentication has been a key topic. However, in this authentication method, various attack techniques have emerged to steal passwords input from the keyboard, hence, the keyboard data does not ensure security. To detect and prevent such an attack, a keyboard data protection technique using random keyboard data generation has been presented. This technique protects keyboard data by generating dummy keyboard data while the attacker obtains the keyboard data. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of keyboard data exposure under the keyboard data protection technique. To prove the proposed attack technique, we gathered all the dummy keyboard data generated by the defense tool, and the real keyboard data input by the user, and evaluated the cybersecurity threat of keyboard data based on the machine learning-based offensive technique. We verified that an adversary obtains the keyboard data with 96.2% accuracy even if the attack technique that makes it impossible to attack keyboard data exposure is used. Namely, the proposed method in this study obviously differentiates the keyboard data input by the user from dummy keyboard data. Therefore, the contributions of this paper are that we derived and verified a new security threat and a new vulnerability of password authentication. Furthermore, a new cybersecurity threat derived from this study will have advantages over the security assessment of password authentication and all types of authentication technology and application services input from the keyboard.

Design and evaluation of an augmented reality game for cybersecurity awareness (CybAR). The number of damaging cyberattacks is increasing exponentially due in part to lack of user awareness of risky online practices, such as visiting unsafe websites, ignoring warning messages, and communicating with unauthenticated entities. Although research has established the role that game-based learning can play in cognitive development and conceptual learning, relatively few serious mobile games have been developed to educate users about different forms of cyberattack and ways of avoiding them. This paper reports the development of an effective augmented reality (AR) game designed to increase cybersecurity awareness and knowledge in an active and entertaining way. The Cybersecurity Awareness using Augmented Reality (CybAR) game is an AR mobile application that teaches not only cybersecurity concepts, but also demonstrates the consequences of actual cybersecurity attacks through feedback. The design and evaluation of the application are described in detail. A survey was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the game received positive responses from 91 participants. The results indicate that CybAR is useful for players to develop an understanding of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Augmented reality. Cybersecurity awareness. Game-based learning.

Cyber security tool kit (cybersectk): A python library for machine learning and cyber security. The cyber security toolkit, CyberSecTK, is a simple Python library for preprocessing and feature extraction of cyber-security-related data. As the digital universe expands, more and more data need to be processed using automated approaches. In recent years, cyber security professionals have seen opportunities to use machine learning approaches to help process and analyze their data. The challenge is that cyber security experts do not have necessary trainings to apply machine learning to their problems. The goal of this library is to help bridge this gap. In particular, we propose the development of a toolkit in Python that can process the most common types of cyber security data. This will help cyber experts to implement a basic machine learning pipeline from beginning to end. This proposed research work is our first attempt to achieve this goal. The proposed toolkit is a suite of program modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and teaching in cyber security and defense. An example of use cases is presented and discussed. Survey results of students using some of the modules in the library are also presented. Cyber security. Feature extraction. Machine learning. Toolkit. 
Keyloggers: silent cyber security weapons. Cyber attackers are always seeking to design and push malicious software programs to unsuspecting users, to intentionally steal or cause damage and exploit data on end user systems. Malware types include spyware, keyloggers, rootkits and adware. In the past, script kiddies hacked computers to show off their skills and have fun. Today, hacking computers has become a huge cybercrime industry. Even as systems have improved in terms of both hardware and software, cyber attacks continue unabated. The privilege level at which keyloggers execute is higher than typical malware, which makes them almost impossible to detect and remove. Dr Akashdeep Bhardwaj of the University of Petroleum & Energy Studies, Dehradun, and Dr Sam Goundar of the University of South Pacific, demonstrate how a keylogger can gather keystrokes and screenshots along with online transactions without a scanner being able to detect it. They also suggest a form of virtual keyboard that could defeat this kind of malware. 
The business benefits of cyber security for SMEs. Cyber security is often discussed in terms of data breaches, regulatory fines and business disruption. The advantages are seldom highlighted. For example, effective cyber security makes it possible for companies to innovate and this drives revenue, profit and growth. Defending against cybercrime can deliver genuine benefits for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and result in more valuable organisations. Cyber security is often discussed in terms of data breaches, regulatory fines and business disruption. However, the advantages are seldom highlighted. Effective cyber security makes it possible for companies to innovate and this drives revenue, profit and growth. Defending against cybercrime can deliver genuine benefits for small and medium-size enterprises. And as organisations of all sizes move towards driving efficiency through digitising processes, it's important for business leaders to redefine how they think about security, argues Guy Lloyd of CySure. 
Addressing cyber security skills: the spectrum, not the silo. With cyber security gaining ever-greater recognition as a key concern in today's organisations, there is an accompanying appreciation that specialist skills are required to support it. However, this has created challenges for employers in recruiting the associated talent, not least because skilled staff are in short supply. With cyber security becoming a key concern in today's organisations, there is an accompanying appreciation that specialist skills are required to support it. As Steven Furnell of the University of Plymouth and Matt Bishop of the University of California at Davis explain, it is important to recognise the breadth of skills needed. The natural way to do this is to recruit talent with suitable qualifications, but for this to work we need to understand what they cover and whether they match what organisations need. 
Cybersecurity in the health care sector [La médecine du futur. La cybercriminalité et le monde médical : les hackers ont plusieurs longueurs d’avance]. Cybersecurity is a real threat in almost all human activity domains. The health sector is a particular vulnerable target for cybercriminals. The first reason is obviously the financial incentive: the value of the content of a personal electronic health record, sold on the darknet, easily exceeds 1000 US dollars. The second reason is the aging Information Technology (IT) infrastructure we are dealing with, both in the hospital sector as well as in the vast majority of private medical practices. There is also an astonishing lack of environmental consciousness and an absence of a real safety culture in the medical profession. Very often there is neither an institutional basic training, nor a continuous and mandatory education in institutional cybersecurity. There is no single magic bullet to solve the problem, but various mechanisms can be put in place to mitigate the risks and limit the hazards as much as possible.La criminalité cybernétique s’attaque à tous les domaines d’activité humaine. Le monde hospitalier est particulièrement vulnérable. En effet, d’une part, un dossier médical personnel (DMP) volé se vend aisément plus de 1.000 dollars sur le «darknet» et, d’autre part, les structures informatiques vieillissantes de nos institutions et de nos cabinets médicaux privés sont particulièrement exposées aux attaques. Viennent s’y ajouter une réelle méconnaissance du danger par les professionnels de soins et un manque de culture de sécurité informatique, illustré par l’absence quasi totale d’une formation initiale et d’une formation continue en la matière. Il n’y a pas une seule réponse simple et définitive à ce fléau, mais différentes solutions peuvent être mises en place rapidement afin de limiter les risques encourus et les dégâts..

Reconciliation of Privacy with Preventive Cybersecurity: The Bright Internet Approach. The emergence of a preventive cybersecurity paradigm that aims to eliminate the sources of cybercrime threats is becoming an increasingly necessary complement to the current self-defensive cybersecurity systems. One concern associated with adopting such preventive measures is the risk of privacy infringement. Therefore, it is necessary to design the future Internet infrastructure so that it can appropriately balance preventive cybersecurity measures with privacy protections. This research proposes to design the Internet infrastructure using the preventive cybersecurity measures of the Bright Internet, namely preventive cybersecurity protocol and identifiable anonymity protocol, and ten privacy rights derived from Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). We then analyze the legitimacy of the five steps of the preventive cybersecurity protocol and the four features of the identifiable anonymity protocol from the perspectives of ten privacy rights. We address the legitimacy from the perspective of potential victims’ self-defense rights. Finally, we discuss four potential risks that may occur to the innocent senders and proposed resilient recovery procedures. Bright internet. GDPR. Identifiable anonymity protocol.

Deep learning for cyber security intrusion detection: Approaches, datasets, and comparative study. In this paper, we present a survey of deep learning approaches for cyber security intrusion detection, the datasets used, and a comparative study. Specifically, we provide a review of intrusion detection systems based on deep learning approaches. The dataset plays an important role in intrusion detection, therefore we describe 35 well-known cyber datasets and provide a classification of these datasets into seven categories. namely, network traffic-based dataset, electrical network-based dataset, internet traffic-based dataset, virtual private network-based dataset, android apps-based dataset, IoT traffic-based dataset, and internet-connected devices-based dataset. We analyze seven deep learning models including recurrent neural networks, deep neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, deep Boltzmann machines, and deep autoencoders. For each model, we study the performance in two categories of classification (binary and multiclass) under two new real traffic datasets, namely, the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and the Bot-IoT dataset. In addition, we use the most important performance indicators, namely, accuracy, false alarm rate, and detection rate for evaluating the efficiency of several methods. Cyber security. Deep learning.

A Bayesian network approach for cybersecurity risk assessment implementing and extending the FAIR model. Quantitative risk assessment can play a crucial role in effective decision making about cybersecurity strategies. The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) is one of the most popular models for quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment. It provides a taxonomic framework to classify cybersecurity risk into a set of quantifiable risk factors and combines this with quantitative algorithms, in the form of a kind of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation combined with statistical approximation techniques, to estimate cybersecurity risk. However, the FAIR algorithms restrict both the type of statistical distributions that can be used and the expandability of the model structure. Moreover, the applied approximation techniques (including using cached data and interpolation methods) introduce inaccuracy into the FAIR model. To address restrictions of the FAIR model, we develop a more flexible alternative approach, which we call FAIR-BN, to implement the FAIR model using Bayesian Networks (BNs). To evaluate the performance of FAIR and FAIR-BN, we use a MC method (FAIR-MC) to implement calculations of the FAIR model without using any of the approximation techniques adopted by FAIR, thus avoiding the corresponding inaccuracy that can be introduced. We compare the empirical results generated by FAIR and FAIR-BN against a large number of samples generated using FAIR-MC. Both FAIR and FAIR-BN provide consistent results compared with FAIR-MC for general cases. However, the FAIR-BN achieves higher accuracy in several cases that cannot be accurately modelled by the FAIR model. Moreover, we demonstrate that FAIR-BN is more flexible and extensible by showing how it can incorporate process-oriented and game-theoretic methods. We call the resulting combined approach Extended FAIR-BN (EFBN) and show that it has the potential to provide an integrated solution for cybersecurity risk assessment and related decision making.

Cybersecurity threat intelligence knowledge exchange based on blockchain: Proposal of a new incentive model based on blockchain and Smart contracts to foster the cyber threat and risk intelligence exchange of information. Although cyber threat intelligence (CTI) exchange is a theoretically useful technique for improving security of a society, the potential participants are often reluctant to share their CTI and prefer to consume only, at least in voluntary based approaches. Such behavior destroys the idea of information exchange. On the other hand, governments are forcing specific entities and operators to report them specific incidents depending on their impact, otherwise there could be sanctions to those operators which are not reporting them on time. Obligations and sanctions are usually discouraging participants to share information voluntarily which will just share and report what is strictly required. We propose a paradigm shift of cybersecurity information exchange by introducing a new way to encourage all participants involved, at all levels, to share relevant information dynamically. It will also contribute to the support and deployment of Dynamic Risk Management frameworks to keep risks under an acceptance level along the time. Participants will have new and specific incentives to share, invest and consume threat intelligence and risk intelligence information depending on their different roles (producers, consumers, investors, donors and owner). Our proposal leverages from standards like Structured Threat Information Exchange, as well as W3C semantic web standards to enable a workspace of knowledge related to behavioral threat intelligence patterning to characterize tactics, techniques and procedures. At the same time, we propose an Ethereum Blockchain Smart contract Marketplace to better incentivize the sharing of that knowledge between all parties involved as well as creating a standard CTI token as a digital asset with a promising value in the market. Simulations and an experimentation were performed to demonstrate its benefits and incentives, but also its potential limits with regard to storage and cost of transactions.

Cyber Security: Effects of Penalizing Defenders in Cyber-Security Games via Experimentation and Computational Modeling. Cyber-attacks are deliberate attempts by adversaries to illegally access online information of other individuals or organizations. There are likely to be severe monetary consequences for organizations and its workers who face cyber-attacks. However, currently, little is known on how monetary consequences of cyber-attacks may influence the decision-making of defenders and adversaries. In this research, using a cyber-security game, we evaluate the influence of monetary penalties on decisions made by people performing in the roles of human defenders and adversaries via experimentation and computational modeling. In a laboratory experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the role of hackers (adversaries) or analysts (defenders) in a laboratory experiment across three between-subject conditions: Equal payoffs (EQP), penalizing defenders for false alarms (PDF) and penalizing defenders for misses (PDM). The PDF and PDM conditions were 10-times costlier for defender participants compared to the EQP condition, which served as a baseline. Results revealed an increase (decrease) and decrease (increase) in attack (defend) actions in the PDF and PDM conditions, respectively. Also, both attack-and-defend decisions deviated from Nash equilibriums. To understand the reasons for our results, we calibrated a model based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) theory to the attack-and-defend decisions collected in the experiment. The model’s parameters revealed an excessive reliance on recency, frequency, and variability mechanisms by both defenders and adversaries. We discuss the implications of our results to different cyber-attack situations where defenders are penalized for their misses and false-alarms. adversaries. cybersecurity. decision-making. defenders. frequency. instance-based learning theory. monetary penalties. recency. 
Model of cybersecurity means financing with the procedure of additional data obtaining by the protection side. The article describes the model of cybersecurity means financing strategies of the information object with incomplete information about the financial resources of the attacking side. The proposed model is the core of the module of the developed decision support system in the problems of choosing rational investing variants for information protection and cybersecurity of various information objects. The model allows to find financial solutions using the tools of the theory of multistep games with several terminal surfaces. The authors proposed an approach that allows information security management to make a preliminary assessment of strategies for financing the effective cybersecurity systems. The model is distinguished by the assumption that the protection side does not have complete information, both about the financing strategies of the attacking side, and about its financial resources state aimed at overcoming cybersecurity lines of the information object. At the same time, the protection side has the opportunity to obtain additional information by the part of its financial resources. This makes it possible for the protection side to obtain a positive result for itself in the case when it can not be received without this procedure. The solution was found using a mathematical apparatus of a nonlinear multistep quality game with several terminal surfaces with alternate moves. In order to verify the adequacy of the model there was implemented a multivariate computational experiment. The results of this experiment are described in the article. Cybersecurity.

An outsourcing model for alert analysis in a cybersecurity operations center. A typical Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC) is a service organization. It hires and trains analysts, whose task is to perform analysis of alerts that were generated while monitoring the client's networks. Due to ever-increasing financial and infrastructure burden on a CSOC driven by the rapidly growing demand for security services, it would become prohibitively expensive to continually expand the size of a CSOC to meet the demands in the future. An alternative solution is to outsource the alert analysis process to on-demand analysts, to provide scalable CSOC service to its clients with features, such as (1) higher throughput, (2) higher quality, and (3) more economical service than the current in-house service. The current outsourcing model is not cost effective and an exact optimization model is computationally inefficient. This article presents a novel two-step sequential mixed integer programming optimization method that is used in the development of a new decision-support business model for outsourcing the alert analysis process. It is demonstrated that through this model, a CSOC can effectively deliver its alert management services with the above-mentioned features. Results indicate that the model is scalable, computationally viable, real-time implementable, and can deliver CSOC services that meet the service-level agreement (SLA) between the CSOC and its client. In addition, the article provides valuable insights into the cost of operating the new business process outsourcing model for cybersecurity services. Alert analysis. CSOC. On-demand analysts.

Review of cyber security threats and proposed trustworthy memory acquisition mechanism. Due to the major exponential leap in the amount of digital data generated, processed, transferred and stored in a daily life brings challenges to the digital forensic field as like it does in other research and technical area. Digital forensics has become rapidly important as a method to investigate a cyber and mobile-assisted crime. While multiple tools are present and much research & development are being undertaken, but huge uncertainties and challenges exist regarding the future of cyber security. In this literature a detailed survey is discussed on security threats in cyber security and analyzing some network with existing tools and proposes a trustworthy memory acquisition management based security solution.

Cyber security meets security politics: Complex technology, fragmented politics, and networked science. In the last decade, cyber incidents have become more expensive, more disruptive, and in many cases more political, with a new body of theoretically informed research emerging in parallel. This article provides the intellectual history to situate this literature in its broader evolutionary context. After identifying and discussing six drivers from the fields of technology, politics, and science that have been influential in the evolution of cyber security politics and how it is studied, we describe three historically contingent clusters of research. Using the same driving factors to look into the future of research on cyber security politics, we conclude that it is a vibrant and diverse biotope that is benefitting from its interdisciplinarity, its relevance for policy, and its cognizance of the interplay between technological possibilities and political choices of state actors. cyber conflict.

Assembling cybersecurity: The politics and materiality of technical malware reports and the case of Stuxnet. This is an article about how cybersecurity gets made, with a focus on the role of commercial computer security firms in generating knowledge in matters of international cybersecurity. The argument is two-fold. Firstly, malware may be an intangible artefact in some ways, but its success and its interpretation as malware is deeply interwoven in social, technical, and material alliances. Secondly, a materialist-minded examination of Symantec’s Stuxnet reports will demonstrate the politically situated nature of how cybersecurity expertise emerges. The article finds that Symantec’s work was not a-political or neutrally-technical: Their experts made profoundly political choices in their analyses. By showing the processes that go into making cybersecurity, the article contributes to a widening and deepening of debates about what is at stake in cybersecurity knowledge and practices. cybersecurity.

50 shades of hacking: How IT and cybersecurity industry actors perceive good, bad, and former hackers. The hacker is the epitome of a cybersecurity threat and the embodied misuse of the Internet. However, in recent years, notions of hacking have begun to change. Blurred boundaries mark the term, best expressed in its overlap with security researcher. This article draws on a 3.5-year research project on the hacker community and applies an international political sociology framework to uncover routines of rationalization. Interviews with IT and cybersecurity industry experts expose accepted identities, practices, and behaviors of hackers, which allows for the construction of in-group and out-group members in the IT and cybersecurity field. Additionally, the empirical findings are used to propose a conceptual framework (the Möbius strip) to situate the moral valence of hackers on a flexible model. Thus, the article provides insight into the ontological and normative complexities that define the study of hackers, as well as the perception of IT and cybersecurity professionals. cybersecurity.

Cyber-noir: Cybersecurity and popular culture. Cybersecurity experts foster a perception of cybersecurity as a gloomy underworld in which the good guys must resort to unconventional tactics to keep at bay a motley group of threats to the digital safety of unsuspecting individuals, businesses, and governments. This article takes this framing seriously, drawing on film studies scholarship that identifies certain aesthetic themes as associated with moral ambiguity in noir films. This article introduces the term cyber-noir to describe the incorporation of noir elements in cybersecurity expert discourses. It argues that the concept of cyber-noir helps explain the persistence of practices that blur legal, moral, and professional lines between legitimate and malicious activity in cyberspace. Consequently, changing cybersecurity requires not only institutional and technological measures, but also a re-constitution of cybersecurity identities themselves.

Co-production of cybersecurity: a case of reported data system break-ins. In this study, we contributed on research of policing cyberspace by analysing how different stakeholder groups (nodal clusters) participate in the formal security network during detecting and handling of data system break-ins in practice. The goal of this article was to study whether citizens have roles within the security network. The analysis was based on data system break-ins (n = 220) reported to the Finnish national computer emergency response team, CERT-FI, in 2012. We detected five types of nodal clusters: computer emergency response teams (CERTs), companies, public organisations, private persons and associations. The roles of nodal clusters were described by using cultural, social, political, economic and symbolic capital. However, the results show that there are differences not only between the nodal clusters but also inside them regarding their positioning within the network. We argue that instead of a type of nodal cluster, division based on the roles and individual needs could be more relevant. Recognition of roles could encourage netizens to co-produce cybersecurity from their respective premises. co-production of security. cybercrime. Cybersecurity. nodal governance. 
Closing the cybersecurity loop. LONG ago, I put an old, black-and-white photo of a country doctor on the cover of Hospitals & Health Networks magazine. I did it to illustrate my story about physicians learning they could use many of their traditional, hang up a shingle, entrepreneurial skills to cope with the mid-1990s emergence of managed healthcare by setting up physician-hospital organizations (PHO).. 
Personality as a predictor of cybersecurity behavior.. Personality may better predict cybersecurity behavior relative to an individual’s stated intentions. however, people often behave in ways that are discordant with what they intend. Assuming most people have the intention of complying with safe practices, it is still no surprise that people violate policies and put sensitive data at risk regularly. Previous research has investigated all of the Big Five personality factors in relation to cybersecurity behavior, although there is no consensus regarding which factors are most important. In this study, data were collected from 676 undergraduate students who were administered the Employees’ Online Security Behavior and Beliefs questionnaire and the Big Five Inventory–44. Significant correlations were observed between self-reported cybersecurity behaviors and some, but not all, personality constructs. Linear regression was used to examine whether the 5 personality factors were significantly associated with cybersecurity behaviors, and a hierarchical regression examined the personality factors that explained additional variance over-and-above cybersecurity behaviors, specifically perceived barriers, response efficacy, and security self-efficacy. Conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness were significantly associated with self-reported cybersecurity behaviors. Results suggest that personality plays an important role in understanding cybersecurity behaviors, which is consistent with a growing body of literature highlighting conscientiousness as a strong predictor of cybersecurity behaviors. The present study’s findings suggest that personality structure is associated with cybersecurity behaviors and that conscientiousness and openness may be particularly salient to this relationship.

CYBERWISER.eu: Innovative Cyber Range Platform for Cybersecurity Training in Industrial Systems. Information technologies are nowadays part of industrial systems. Employees in charge of managing these systems typically have little or very little knowledge of cybersecurity. In this work we initially explore the challenges related to cybersecurity training in industrial systems and then we propose an approach based on CYBERWISER.eu cyber range platform. A cyber range provides a multipurpose virtual environment in which organisations can test critical capabilities and reveal how effectively they integrate people, processes, and technology to protect their strategic information, services, and assets. By facilitating high-fidelity simulations, a cyber range can associate the cybersecurity training phase with a personalized security testing, together with a unit testing, on different kind of systems, including SCADA. cyber range. cyber threat. cyber-attacks. cyber-physical system. cybersecurity. cyberwiser. security testing. training. unit testing. 
Security assessment of blockchain in Chinese classified protection of cybersecurity. Classified protection is one of primary security policies of information system in many countries. With the increasing popularity of blockchain in various fields of applications, it is extremely necessary to promote classified protection for blockchain’s risk assessment in order to push forward the sustainable development of blockchain. Taking the Level 3 in Chinese classified protection 2.0 as an example, this paper proposes the common evaluation rules on blockchain to ensure that blockchain can meet the needs of countries to build it as critical infrastructure. Both assessment requirements and enforcement proposals are presented and analyzed from the standpoint of blockchain’s core technologies, e.g., peer-to-peer network, distributed ledger, contract’s scripting system, and consensus mechanism. Moreover, the assessment results on three main platforms, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger, are summarized and analyzed in compliance with the control points specified in the level 3. Our investigation indicates that the current blockchain is able to satisfy the requirements of evaluation items in many aspects, such as software fault tolerance, resource control, backup and recovery, but further improvements are still needed for some aspects, including security audit, access control, identification and authentication, data integrity, etc., in order to satisfy the requirements of important fields on national security, economic development and human life.

Quantifying the significance and relevance of cyber-security text through textual similarity and cyber-security knowledge graph. In order to proactively mitigate cyber-security risks, security analysts have to continuously monitor sources of threat information. However, the sheer amount of textual information that needs to be processed is overwhelming, and it requires a great deal of mundane labor to separate the threats from the noise. We propose a novel approach to represent the relevance and significance of the cyber-security text in quantitative numbers. We trained custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model and constructed a Cyber-security Knowledge Graph (CKG) to infer the subjective relevance of the cyber-security text to the user and to generate correlation features. In addition, the significance of the given text was analyzed in terms of its textual similarity with different repositories of pre-defined ‘‘significant’’ text and the maximum similarities were computed. These analysis results then act as features of the classifier to generate the significance score. The experimental result showed that the overall system could determine the significance and relevance of the text within a controlled environment with 88% accuracy. Cyber threat.

Prototype cross platform oriented on cybersecurity, virtual connectivity, big data and artificial intelligence control. This article describes a prototype cross platform based on intelligent switching of Virtual Private Network (VPN) communications by means of artificial intelligence algorithms able to identify and classify attack risks in self-learning mode by analysing the traffic logs of the system. The platform is also suitable for disaster recovery, data migration and ensures virtualization of communications between nodes in case of risk detection. In order to test the models and evaluate the accuracy of the AI algorithms for risk detection and classification, a number of cyberattack scenario have been simulated. The proposed platform implements Cassandra Big Data system interfacing with supernodes enabling data migration, security and disaster recovery. By comparing the performance of different AI algorithms, the results showthat a XGBoost-based algorithm is the most efficient and accurate method for cyberattacks prevention, showing a remarkable ability of classifying and identifying characteristic patterns of the most representative traffic log variables. The research work has been carried out within the framework of a research industry project. Artificial intelligence. Big data. Cybersecurity. Data security. Switching virtualization. 
Regulatory perspective on nuclear cyber security: The fundamental issues. We are living in a digital and information-driven age and need to store information related to virtually every aspect of our lives, nuclear information included. For computer system to be reliable and secure in nuclear facilities, unauthorized event changes must be prevented (which means maintaining - confidentiality), field device inputs and outputs must remain immutable throughout their usable lifetime (which means maintaining - integrity), and all component parts should remain in an operable state (which means maintaining - availability).The dynamic and complex nature of cyber threats has made it a serious challenge to secure computer systems in nuclear facilities. A number of varied cyber security services, policies, mechanisms, strategies and regulatory frameworks have been adopted, including: confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, encipherment, defense-in-depth (DID), design basis threat (DBT), IAEA technical guidance documents such as: GS-R-1, GS-R-2, GS-R-3, GS-G-3.1-3.5, NSS20, NSS23-G, NSS13, NSS17, NST036, NST045, and NST047, IEEE standard 7-4.3.2-2010, NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-82, NEI 04-04, NEI 08-09 and country-specific requirements such as: 10 CFR 73.54, RG 5.71 (U.S.NRC), KINS/RG-N08.22 (South Korea). However, threats remain persistent. This paper is aimed at providing a regulatory perspective on nuclear cyber security, its relationship to nuclear safety and security, regulatory requirements and global best practice recommendations for nuclear cyber security, and strategies to prevent and counteract threats. This study is imperative as Nigeria prepares to join the league of countries with operational nuclear power plants and research reactors following approval and adoption of the nuclear power programme roadmap in 2007 and contract signing with Rosatom of Russia for NPP and research reactor construction.

Valuation of information resources in the analysis of cybersecurity entrepreneurship. The purpose of the article is to justify the approach to assessing of the valuation of information resources in the analysis of cybersecurity entrepreneurship. Like any other economic resource, information has a value that you need to not only increase, but also be able to protect during the process of entrepreneurship. The most developed resource screening tool with the special features is structured analysis and design technique of real options. Real options are defined as valuable, rare and difficult to reproduce abilities or resources that create exclusive opportunities for the entrepreneur to choose strategies for developing his activities. Each real option has its own specifics, which necessitates a certain modification of the general methodology for specific conditions. When choosing a strategy for ensuring cybersecurity as a basic protected resource, structural (organizational) capital should be recognized, since an entrepreneur does not have legal ownership rights for employees and, accordingly, for their human capital. Nevertheless, the costs of protecting intellectual property arising from joint organizational and labor activities should be taken into account. According to statistics, up to 40% of all information leakages are associated with relationships within the organization and the attitude of staff towards work, respectively, the cost of a protected resource should take into account the level and state of organizational culture. Proceeding from special aspects of cybersecurity, it should be resorted to indirect measurements of the volatility of the main resource. The methods and indicators of indirect measurements should follow from the methods for assessing the main resource in the option, which will be the directions of subsequent studies. Entrepreneurship.

Cyber security entity recognition method based on residual dilation convolution neural network. In recent years, cybersecurity threats have increased, and data-driven security intelligence analysis has become a hot research topic in the field of cybersecurity. In particular, the artificial intelligence technology represented by the knowledge graph can provide support for complex cyberattack detection and unknown cyberattack detection in multi-source heterogeneous threat intelligence data. Cybersecurity entity recognition is the basis for the construction of threat intelligence knowledge graphs. The composition of security entities in open network text data is very complex, which makes traditional deep learning methods difficult to identify accurately. Based on the pre-training language model of BERT (pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers), a cybersecurity entity recognition model BERT-RDCNN-CRF based on residual dilation convolutional neural network and conditional random field was proposed. The BERT model was used to train the character-level feature vector representation. Combining the residual convolution and the dilation neural network model to effectively extract the important features of the security entity, and finally obtain the BIO annotation of each character through CRF. Experiments on the large-scale cybersecurity entity annotation dataset constructed show that the proposed method achieves better results than the LSTM-CRF model, the BiLSTM-CRF model and the traditional entity recognition model.

Best practices in the application of the concept of resilience: building hybrid warfare and cybersecurity capabilities in the hungarian defense forces. In its Global Strategy for foreign and security policy, the EU ap-plies resilience as a comprehensive concept of internal and external secu-rity. In parallel, at the 2016 Summit in Warsaw, Allied leaders decided to boost NATO’s resilience to the full spectrum of threats. Each NATO member needs to be resilient to a major shock caused by a natural disaster, failure of critical infrastructure, a hybrid, or an armed attack. Hybrid war-fare, including cyberattacks, is recognized as a significant security chal-lenge. The National Security Strategy of Hungary, adopted in 2020, confirms that the primary international framework of Hungary’s security and defense policy is NATO and EU membership and highlights the need to en-hance the country’s resilience against hybrid attacks. This article provides an analysis of the application of the concept of resilience in the Hungarian defense sector. It introduces the development of the resilience of the Hungarian Defense Forces against hybrid threats, including their cyber compo-nent, while generating options for the decision-makers regarding the military and information instruments of national power. The author identifies potential hybrid threats against Hungary, a possible cyberattack scenario, and lines of effort to achieve a feasible level of resilience to such threats. He takes account of the political and military environment, as well as wider national issues in view of hybrid threats and main features and dilemmas of cyber warfare, thus aiming to facilitate the application of the concept of resilience in Hungary.

Framework for cybersecurity centers to mass scan networks. The huge number of devices available in cyberspace and the increasing number of security vulnerabilities discovered daily have added many difficulties in keeping track of security vulnerabilities, especially when not using special security tools and software. Mass scanning of the Internet has opened a broad range of possibilities for security tools that help cybersecurity centers detect weaknesses and vulnerabilities in cyberspace. However, one critical issue faced by national cybersecurity centers is the collection of information about IP addresses and subnet ranges. To develop a data collection mechanism for such information and maintain this information with continuous updates, a scanning system is needed. Therefore, this research creates a novel mass scanning framework that collects the information needed for any security investigation of cyberspace as well as preserving the obtained information for any future research analysis by the Saudi National Cybersecurity Center (NCSC), now part of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA). In the proposed framework, multiple instances of the scan are distributed across hosts acting as virtual scan engines, and network ranges are split among the hosts to schedule daily or weekly scanning for a wide range of IP addresses among a possible 65,535 ports per IP. In comparison with other benchmarking tools such as Nmap scanner, our proposed framework leads to faster scanning of cyberspace and greatly reduces scanning time to 30% of Nmap’s scanning time.

CYBERSECURITY ASPECTS OF E-LEARNING PLATFORMS [АСПЕКТИ К1БЕРБЕЗПЕКИ ПЛАТФОРМ ДИСТАНЦ1ЙНОГО НАВЧАННЯ]. The subject of study in the article is the platforms used to organize the educational process in the context of distance learning. The following platforms are selected: learning content management systems (open source systems and individual development), Google Classroom service, e-mail, and cloud data storage. The objects of the educational process for which the security state must be provided are shown. Such assets are files (lectures, tasks for laboratory work), a bank of questions (a total set of questions from which tests are created to control knowledge), and grades (for laboratory work and modular control of knowledge). The goal of the work is a comparative analysis of distance learning platforms in the aspect of cybersecurity. The main threats are a violation of the availability and confidentiality of data in the educational process. It is also possible to modify marks due to the exploitation vulnerabilities of the system or gaining access to the functions of the learning content management system administrator. The probability of data being compromised is higher than the probability of modification, as evidenced by information from vulnerability databases about numerous vulnerabilities in learning content management systems. An accessibility violation is a result of a denial of service, that is, the resource on which the necessary files are located becomes inaccessible to users. The method of expert evaluation with variables of fuzzy logic is used. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the most flexible and convenient platform is the learning content management system of individual development, at the same time it is the most unsecure among the platforms considered. An open-source learning content management system is a more secure platform due to the presence of a global community that can identify security problems faster than attackers. Using Google Classroom and using email with cloud storage is safer, but these approaches are inferior in usability and functionality. Conclusions. Choosing a distance-learning platform is about finding a compromise between security and convenience in the form of a wide functionality of the system. When deploying a centralized learning content management system, it is important to remember that this system is an object of critical information infrastructure, and the requirements for critical systems must be met for it. critical information infrastructure. cybersecurity. distance learning. learning content management systems. 
What (if any) behaviour change techniques do government-led cybersecurity awareness campaigns use?. With the surge in cyber incidents in recent years, many linked to human error, governments are quite naturally developing security campaigns to improve citizens' security behaviour. However, it remains not only unclear how successful these campaigns are in changing behaviour, but also what established behaviour change techniques-if any-they employ in order to achieve this goal. To investigate this, we analysed 17 government-sponsored cybersecurity campaign materials. We coded the materials for their intervention functions according to the Behaviour Change Wheel and their behaviour change techniques in accordance with the Behavioural Change Technique Taxonomy (version 1). Our findings show that security campaigns are often focused on education and increasing awareness, under the assumption that as long as citizens are aware of the risk, and are provided with information on how to improve their security behaviour, behaviour will change. Additionally, there is a lack of published effectiveness studies investigating the direct effects of a governmental cybersecurity campaign. Proposed improvements to security campaigns are discussed.

CYBER SECURITY OF WIRELESS SMART SYSTEMS: CHANNELS OF INTRUSIONS AND RADIO FREQUENCY VULNERABILITIES [К1БЕРБЕЗПЕКА БЕЗПРОВОДОВИХ СМАРТ-СИСТЕМ: КАНАЛИ ВТРУЧАНЬ ТА РАД1ОЧАСТОТН1 ВРАЗЛИВОСТ1]. The subject of this study is the radio frequency cyber vulnerability of information and control interaction technology in the wireless smart systems (WSS). WSS is the cyber-physical systems, that operate within the OSI model. The specificity and specialization of these systems are determined by radio technologies of the physical layer. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT, including medical IoMT), the Internet of Drones (IoD), systems for aviation monitoring ADS-B and traffic management ATM, and, in the future, the Internet of Everything (IoE) - all are types of WSS. The aim is to analyze the radio frequency parameters of information and control interaction in the WSS to identify possible radio frequency cyber vulnerabilities in the WSS. Objectives: summarize and systematize the physical and functional parameters of wireless technologies in the ISM (Industrial Scientific & Medical Band) and SRD (Short range devices) ranges, which are significant from the WSS radiofrequency cyber vulnerability perspective, including navigation technologies. analyze trends and methods of successful cyber attacks on the WSS. carry out expert assessments of potential WSSs cyber vulnerabilities depending on their architecture and application area. The methods used: analysis of trends in known radiofrequency incidents and expert assessments of the cyber vulnerability of the WSS information and control interaction channels. The following results were obtained: 12 actual WSS radio technologies were analyzed. 6 types of possible radio frequency cyber attacks on the WSS were typified. The expert assessment of the probability of exploiting vulnerabilities by ranges, radio technologies, and attack type was made. The special danger of high-tech targeted APT attacks, as well as the high potential radio vulnerability of cyber-physical systems, was shown. The cyber vulnerability of ADS-B aircraft systems was especially noted. Conclusions. The scientific novelty of the results obtained is as follows: a trend of APT attacks cost reduction and an increase in the probability of their implementation through the new capabilities of SDR technology (Software Defined Radio) were revealed. The possibility of a controlled SDR compromising of the security parameters of WSS channels in any radio range was shown. A promising direction of research was proposed - SDR-penetration testing of WSS. aviation cyber security. radio frequency cyber vulnerability. radio frequency information and control interaction.

Efficient hevc integrity verification scheme for multimedia cybersecurity applications. Multimedia cybersecurity is a prevalent research topic in the digital world due to the rapid progress of digital multimedia and Internet applications. Watermarking, encryption, and steganography schemes are employed to attain multimedia data confidentiality and robustness. However, these schemes are externally applied on trusted computers, and there has been a lack of similar schemes that can be effectively and effciently enabled through an untrusted transmission medium. In this work, a self-embedding-based High-Effciency Video Coding (HEVC) transmission and integrity verification framework is presented. This framework is robust and reliable for verifying the integrity of HEVC frames transmitted through insecure communication channels. Firstly, the transmitted HEVC frames are divided into a number of blocks with a certain block size. After that, a discrete transform is used for self-embedding of watermarks from each block into another one depending on a predefined mechanism. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are tested for this task. The watermarked HEVC frames are transmitted through a wireless communication channel, and hence they become subject to different attacks and corruptions. At the receiver side, the secret watermarks in each block are sensed with a correlation-based method to discover dubious counterfeit operations. To verify the reliability of the suggested transmission framework and its ability to achieve high protection and robust content verification of the transmitted HEVC frames over insecure communication channels, different HEVC analyses and comparisons are performed. Simulation results demonstrate the suitability of the suggested transmission framework for different multimedia cybersecurity applications. Furthermore, the comparative analysis shows that the DFT is an effcient discrete transform that can be employed with the proposed transmission framework to guarantee a higher HEVC frame integrity. It allows higher sensitivity to simple modifications in the transmitted watermarked HEVC frames. This makes the suggested cybersecurity framework applicable, secure, and appropriate for multimedia integrity verification purposes. Dct. Dft. Dwt. Hevc Cybersecurity. Integrity VerifiCation..

Establishment of Trust in Internet of Things by Integrating Trusted Platform Module: To Counter Cybersecurity Challenges. With the increasing day-to-day acceptance of IOT computing, the issues related to it are also getting more attention. The current IOT computing infrastructure brings some security challenges concerned with the users/customers and CSP. The users can store their confidential data at IOT storage and can access them anytime when they need. Lack of trust exists among IOT users and between IOT users and CSP. The prevention of this risk is a big research issue and it needs to be solved. There is a need for trusted IOT computing in recent times to provide trusted services. Here, we propose the integration of TPM in IOT computing to performs cryptographic operations and provide hardware-based security. In this domain, different schemes and methods have been proposed to build trust in IOT computing, but the suitable solution has not been presented by these schemes because these schemes lack in terms of some security services. A comparative study based on trusted computing schemes has also been presented in this paper along with different implementations of critical analysis. Our study is based on an overview of the main issues and summarizing the literature along with their strengths and limitations. In the end, we integrated the trusted platform module in the IOT architecture to establish the trust in IOT computing and to enhance the cybersecurity challenges and evaluated it with the help of mathematical/algorithms/graph theory/matrices and logical diagrams. 
Novel teaching learning and evaluation activities for imbibing the concepts of cyber security as perennial thought-process in the learners’ digital life. The use of Internet by students is growing exponentially every year. This younger generation learns technology quickly, but is ignorant about ensuring the safety by reading disclaimers or licenses before agreeing to them. Also they are more social online than in real world, hence they do not hesitate in sharing their life online which they probably won't share in person. These all things can result in some irreversible loss, if misused by cyber criminals. Thus it has become very necessary to make this young generation aware about security aspects of the digital world i.e cyber security. The objective was not just to make them aware of all the dangers present out there, but also to inculcate the safety habits in their day to day digital life. This could be only done by having complete interactive classes, rather than conventional teaching. Hence planning and execution of different teaching as well as evaluation methods were done, wherein the student’s active participation was encouraged. The tasks included preparation of unique cyber-crime diary, Dramatization/Presentation, Video Creation, poster presentation. The Paper focuses on all Teaching- Learning techniques as well as evaluation methodologies used for creating awareness among the current generation about safe journey into their digital life. The paper also discusses the feedback received from students regarding the techniques and efforts used for enriching their knowledge about cyber security. Cyber laws. Cyber Security.

Filling Global Governance Gaps in Cybersecurity: International and European Legal Perspectives. The many recent cyber incidents have shown how cybersecurity has entered the realm of international relations. Several international organizations have taken cybersecurity policy initiatives, notably the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU). Both organizations aspire to a leading role in enhancing cybersecurity resilience. To date, however, these initiatives have not resulted in much regulation. This article examines which factors make lawmaking and the regulation of cybersecurity difficult at the international level, and whether some of these impediments are shared at the EU legislative level. Are difficulties in regulating cybersecurity embedded in the normative processes at the UN or the EU, or are they inherent to the high-tech phenomenon of cyber? As for the UN, the article looks at the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE). While previous reports of the UN GGE seemed to point to an emerging international opinio juris, recent developments in the UN General Assembly (UNGA) show a strongly divided international community. At the EU level, the article discusses the two main legislative initiatives on cybersecurity that have seen the light of day: the 2016 Directive on Network and Information Security and the 2019 EU Cybersecurity Act. cybersecurity.

Issues on Information Systems, ICTs, Cyber-Crimes, Cyber Security, Cyber Ethics, and National Security in Nigeria: Librarians’ Research. Information and knowledge has become vital economic resources in this new era. Yet, along with new opportunities, the dependence on information systems brought new threats. Crime remains elusive and ever strives to hide in the face of development, while cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. Therefore, this paper examines issues on the Information system, ICT, cybercrime, cyber security, cyber ethics and national security in Nigeria. It is a research work carried out by librarians using selected youths in Wuse area of Abuja Municipal Area Council as a case study. The survey research method was used on the population of 150 respondents randomly selected using a convenient sampling method. All the questionnaires were validly filled and returned. The result shows that the main aim of our national security policy is to ensure that our national survival is free from threat and to ensure that our territorial integrity is free from infringement. Majority of the respondents indicated that the methods cyber criminals often used in defrauding its victims are through identity theft and fraud, and also through making direct contact with their victims using emails and phones calls, etc. The rate of cyber-security and adherence to cyber ethics by internet users is low. The paper recommends amongst others that for the government to combat the menace of cybercrimes, the government should do more in sensitizing the public about cyber-security through its appropriate agencies.

Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity covers the broad range of technical and social issues that must be considered to protect networked information systems. The importance of the concept has increased as so many government, business, and day-to-day activities globally have moved online. It has been increasingly referred to in both academic and mainstream publications since 2003, in fields including software engineering, international relations, crisis management and public safety, slowly overtaking more technical terms such as computer/system/data security (popular in the 1970s/ 1980s) and information security (popular from the mid 1990s). But its strong association with national security and defence agencies, and disconnection from social science notions such as place, have led to concerns of inappropriate cyber securitisation of government programmes.

Data-Driven Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph Construction for Industrial Control System Security. Industrial control systems (ICS) involve many key industries, which once attacked will cause heavy losses. However, traditional passive defense methods of cybersecurity have difficulty effectively dealing with increasingly complex threats. a knowledge graph is a new idea to analyze and process data in cybersecurity analysis. We propose a novel overall framework of data-driven industrial control network security defense, which integrated fragmented multisource threat data with an industrial network layout by a cybersecurity knowledge graph. In order to better correlate data to construct a knowledge graph, we propose a distant supervised relation extraction model ResPCNN-ATT. it is based on a deep residual convolutional neural network and attention mechanism, reduces the influence of noisy data in distant supervision, and better extracts deep semantic features in sentences by using deep residuals. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in the field of general cybersecurity by using dataset CSER. the model proposed in this paper achieves higher accuracy than other models. And then, the dataset ICSER was used to construct a cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) on the basis of analyzing specific industrial control scenarios, visualizing the knowledge graph for further security analysis to the industrial control system. 
A Strategic Vision to Reduce Cybercrime to Enhance Cyber Security. The cyber-security development for future generations is at stake as a global concern. The existing strategic and policy structures on cyber security and awareness-raising at many levels needs more investigation in order to formulate workable and efficient strategic vision that addresses actual needs and challenges. The justification for this work is therefore to test the robustness, in contrast with some of the most technologically advanced countries on the Asian Continent and others like the USA, Japan, of Saudi Arabia's current cyber security strategy in order to keep the NCSS up-to-date. This research aimed to develop a strategic vision to combat cybercrime to enhance cyber security. The research results confirmed the approval of the members of the study community to a medium degree on the reality of digital extremism and cyber terrorism as seen by the researcher. Moreover, the approval of the members of the study community was to a high degree on the role of combating cybercrime in promoting human security as seen by the researcher. The members of the study community agreed with a high degree on the obstacles identified by the researcher to combat cyber-crimes to enhance human security in Saudi Arabia. There was a high approval of the study community members on the strategic vision developed by the researcher to combat cyber-crimes to enhance human security in Saudi Arabia. Cyber-Crime Prevention.

Comparative analysis and design of cybersecurity maturity assessment methodology using nist csf, cobit, iso/iec 27002 and pci dss. Data or Information security in today's digital era is crucial in every organization that needs to pay attention. Management of organizational information is one of the components in realizing Good Corporate Governance. The measure of an adequate level of protection is an indicator of the cybersecurity awareness aspects of an organization's business processes in the short, medium, and long term, especially in the field that deals with information and communication technology (ICT). To make this happen, it requires a security standard that is appropriate and follows its needs to help organizations know the maturity level of cybersecurity in protecting its information security. The ABC organization is one of the Government agencies that manage the critical infrastructure and Indonesian digital economies. The organization has currently implemented several international security standards through its planning, implementation, evaluation document, and ICT activities. However, based on the national information security readiness assessment, information security management readiness results are still not optimal. In this study, an analysis of the NIST, ISO 27002, COBIT, and PCI DSS security standards has been carried out, which are ABC organizational security standards in managing ICT by assigned tasks and functions. Furthermore, the analysis result is used as materials for drafting a cybersecurity maturity framework through the four standard approaches that have become the basis for ICT management. The proposed concept of twenty-one integrated cybersecurity categories is expected to be a capital in measure ICT management performance in ABC organizations. COBIT. Cybersecurity Maturity. ICT.

A Comprehensive Study of the IoT Cybersecurity in Smart Cities. Smart cities exploit emerging technologies such as Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance public services management. The use of IoT allows detecting and reporting specific parameters related to different domains of the city, such as health, waste management, agriculture, transportation, and energy. LoRa technologies, for instance, are used to develop IoT solutions for several smart city domains thanks to its available features, but sometimes people (i.e., citizens, information technology administrators, or city managers) might think that these available features involve cybersecurity risks. This study explores the cybersecurity aspects that define an assessment model of cybersecurity maturity of IoT solutions to develop smart city applications. In that sense, we perform a systematic literature review based on a top-down approach of cybersecurity incident response in IoT ecosystems. Besides, we propose and validate a model based on risk levels to evaluate the IoT cybersecurity maturity in a smart city. CCBY. Bayesian network. cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity of Onboard Charging Systems for Electric Vehicles &#x2013. Review, Challenges and Countermeasures. In this paper, the impacts of various data integrity attacks on the power electronic hardware present in an EV charger are comprehensively analyzed in order to provide necessary recommendations to defend against cyberattacks on electric vehicles and their onboard charging (OBC) systems. The adverse scenarios arising due to cyberattacks are carefully reviewed in this study, which includes (a) interfering with the main charger controller (FPGA) logic and its data, (b) establishing fake communication between the charging controller and other electronic control units (ECUs) connected over same controller area network (CAN) bus, and (c) interfering with the battery management system functionalities. A 6.6kW interleaved totem-pole PFC front-end followed by a high frequency DC-DC converter is used as our OBC representative system in this analysis. Possibilities and ways of potential cyberattacks on this model are investigated in detail. Effort is made towards providing software as well as hardware design-level protection mechanisms to mitigate the malicious effects of such cyberattacks on the OBC hardware. This system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the fault occurrences under various data integrity attacks as well as to validate the effectiveness of our proposed countermeasure approaches. Quantitative analyses of the obtained results clearly demonstrate that if adequate precautionary measures are properly taken while designing the charging architecture (e.g., implementing intelligence to the main controller), any electrical hazard or deterioration of health of the components can be avoided to the maximum extent under the circumstances of a malicious cyberattack.

Discursive continuity and change in the time of Covid-19: the case of EU cybersecurity policy. This article explores the extent to which Covid-19 has impacted the trajectory of EU Cybersecurity Policy. The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19 related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive institutionalism, that the EU’s response to Covid-19 in the field of cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence that emerged in the 1980s.

Cybersecurity graph model of information resources. With the growing activity of cyberattacks on automated information systems, the task of determining the priority of building protective equipment is becoming increasingly relevant. The model for solving this problem, based on the ontological description and graph representation of the system security environment, is proposed. The ontologies of threats, resources (objects), and protection mechanisms are developed. The proposed approach is based on construction and partitioning of the graph of the relations of threats and system objects into subgraphs (subsystems) as connected components of the original graph with subsequent finding the relative risks of the damage of these subsystems within the overall system to find out the subsystems to which should be given priority to increasing their security level. The risk assessments of resource damage are determined based on expert threat scores and expert scores of the level of harm (loss) from damage. The algorithm has been developed by which the relative risks of subsystems are calculated. Analytical expressions are given and the example is used to calculate the risks of damage of the objects for the system without the partition into subsystems and taking into account the partition, to detect critical subsystems for protection. Application of the model gives a clearer picture of the interaction of threats and system resources, helps one to find the most significant vulnerabilities of the system and to look for ways to improve its security in the process of solving practical tasks to ensure cybersecurity. The performed calculations confirm the correctness and adequacy of the proposed model, its simplicity and ease of use, providing an effective tool for experts and developers of security systems for automated information systems.

Right to privacy and state policy on cyber security. Necessity or threat from the state [Prawo do prywatności a polityka państwa w zakresie cyberbezpieczeństwa. Konieczność czy zagrożenie ze strony państwa]. In the era of extremely rapid technological development, the state is directing particular interest towards security in cyberspace and cyber security is becoming a dominant value in its policy. Such a policy may cause a number of negative consequences, such as the willingness to introduce legal regulations that may limit civil rights and freedoms, and in the next stage may lead to violence. As a result, their implementation causes excessive, and often unauthorized, interference of public authorities in the sphere of citizens' privacy. It should also be stressed that the global nature of the Internet means that mechanisms based on territoriality in a rather limited way ensure effective protection of individual rights against violations by public authorities in cyberspace. In addition to significant physical damage and direct financial losses, the mere likelihood of future cyber threats may cause social distrust and unwillingness to work with new technologies.

Assessing and forecasting cybersecurity impacts. Cyberattacks constitute a major threat to most organizations. Beyond financial consequences, they may entail multiple impacts that need to be taken into account when making risk management decisions to allocate the required cybersecurity resources. Experts have traditionally focused on a technical perspective of the problem by considering impacts in relation with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. We adopt a more comprehensive approach identifying a broader set of generic cybersecurity objectives, the corresponding set of attributes, and relevant forecasting and assessment models. These are used as basic ingredients for decision support in cybersecurity risk management. Cybersecurity. Expert judgement. Forecasting. Multiattribute utility. Risk management. 
Cyber security and key management issues for internet of things: Techniques, requirements, and challenges. Internet of Things-based environments pose various challenges due to their anytime/anywhere computing, and the efficient cryptographic based key management is one of the major challenges in Internet of Things. The key management life cycle consists of initialization, key generation, key registration, key backup, key update, key recovery, and key revocation. Our contribution in this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art key management schemes and techniques in different scenarios, such as mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, and the Internet of Things environments. Further different issues related specifically to the Internet of Things environment are discussed and the causes and effects pertaining to the security breach for Internet of Things are identified. Furthermore, in this research work, we develop a novel permutation of threshold and identity-based key management schemes for the Internet of Things environment and have proposed future directions to counteract the attacks on confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability of security services in the Internet of Things environment and identified the two key management schemes, that is, identity and threshold schemes for Internet of Things, to resolve Internet of Things key management issues and maximum possible security services effective implementation. We evaluate our scheme with the help of mathematical and statistical techniques. 
On Identifying Threats and Quantifying Cybersecurity Risks of Mnos Deploying Heterogeneous Rats. Wireless networks constitute a significant attack vector for adversaries due to their wide usage in our everyday life. As the fifth generation of wireless networks reaches maturity, several vulnerabilities affecting earlier generations have been resolved. Nevertheless the coexistence of legacy wireless technologies is giving rise to the risk of allowing adversaries to perform downgrade attacks, thus bypassing the improved security of the state-of-the-art communication networks. Vulnerabilities due to the trade-off between security and usability could also exist in the latest wireless networking technologies. hence mobile network operators need to be aware of the risks related to both protocol vulnerabilities and configuration defects. This paper proposes a methodology for the systematic identification of vulnerabilities associated with wireless access protocols and systems and the quantitative evaluation of the resulting risks for mobile operators using attack trees, while considering the current legislative frameworks. The proposed methodology has been designed to aid both, mobile operators towards planning more effective cybersecurity strategies and adopting efficient defences to minimise the probability of an attack and predict its impact on the operational, market and business aspects of mobile network operators. The proposed risk assessment analysis is evaluated over three distinct vertical scenarios, namely an emergency call, a high-speed train commute and a massive public event, with the most relevant threats and their impact being measured and discussed. The evaluation of the model revealed significant results for mobile network operators that are deploying a mix of legacy and state of the art cellular technologies.

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cybersecurity Assessment of Wind Integrated Power Systems. The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) is rapidly increasing in electric power systems (EPS). While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This article proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In addition, the experiments present the method's scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared to a random transition policy. contingency analysis. cyberattacks.

Cyber-Security Incidents and Audit Quality. As signals of internal control weaknesses, cyber security incidents can represent significant risk factors to the quality of financial reporting. We empirically assess the audit quality implications of data breaches for a large sample of US firms. Using a difference-in-difference approach based on a matched sample of breached and non-breached firms, we find no evidence that cyber-security incidents result in a decline in audit quality. Instead, we observe positive shifts in four widely-used proxies for audit quality. We document that breached firms (i) experience a decrease in abnormal accruals, (ii) are less likely to report small profits or small earnings increases, (iii) are more likely to be issued a going concern report, and (iv) are less likely to restate their financial statements in the two years following a breach. Our results indicate that auditors effectively offset increases in audit risk through additional substantive testing and audit effort. Our evidence supports the view that auditors have increased their audit risk awareness and put in place adequate procedures to deal with the consequences of cyber-security incidents. Audit Quality.

Reconsidering the cybersecurity framework in the road transportation domain. The Automotive Industry has advanced significantly and this process is constantly continuing. Cars are controlled by hundreds of electrical units, which affects directly numberless safety and security related risk factors, especially considering incidents realized in the cyberspace. Due to the increasing number of connected cars, new testing facilities and methods need to be established, to support the solutions, for these novel challenges. For this reason, the Hungarian government has founded the Zalaegerszeg test track, and its special purpose is to provide space for the validation of future vehicles. The overview focused on the presently applied validation methods and processes has highlighted, that cybersecurity related testing methods – from a scientific point of view – are only slightly detailed in the sector of Automobile Industry. In a sector specific term, the lack of a holistic approach, may result a relevant barrier, in the future, for providing a socially tolerable level of cybersecurity. Accordingly, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive cybersecurity reference model, to provide a solid basis for describing attack patterns and characterizing malicious intervention profiles.

A Survey on Machine Learning Techniques for Cyber Security in the Last Decade. Pervasive growth and usage of the Internet and mobile applications have expanded cyberspace. The cyberspace has become more vulnerable to automated and prolonged cyberattacks. Cyber security techniques provide enhancements in security measures to detect and react against cyberattacks. The previously used security systems are no longer sufficient because cybercriminals are smart enough to evade conventional security systems. Conventional security systems lack efficiency in detecting previously unseen and polymorphic security attacks. Machine learning (ML) techniques are playing a vital role in numerous applications of cyber security. However, despite the ongoing success, there are significant challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness of ML systems. There are incentivized malicious adversaries present in the cyberspace that are willing to game and exploit such ML vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting cyberspace against attacks, by presenting a literature on ML techniques for cyber security including intrusion detection, spam detection, and malware detection on computer networks and mobile networks in the last decade. It also provides brief descriptions of each ML method, frequently used security datasets, essential ML tools, and evaluation metrics to evaluate a classification model. It finally discusses the challenges of using ML techniques in cyber security. This paper provides the latest extensive bibliography and the current trends of ML in cyber security.

A Holistic Review of Cybersecurity and Reliability Perspectives in Smart Airports. Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and aviation sector have resulted in the emergence of smart airports. Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports. Furthermore, we provide a classification of smart airport sub-systems based on their purpose and criticality and address cyber threats that can affect the security of smart airport's networks. artificial intelligence.

Cyber security in material manufacturing [Malzeme üretiminde siber güvenlik]. Industry 4.0, a new industry revolution, is happening now and several developed countries are leading the path. Internet of things (IoT) is also encompassed by Industry 4.0. In the future, more devices in factories are to be connected to Ethernet or Internet. However, this makes the companies, devices and researchers vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Recently, some cyber-attacks which have happened to some companies or countries verify the danger. Sintering systems and furnaces are used for research by universities and for series manufacturing by factories. Arc furnaces and induction furnaces are also commonly used devices in metal factories. A sintering system, an arc furnace or an induction furnace which is connected to Internet or Ethernet may also be under cyber-attack threat. The danger may be prevented by taking necessary precautions. In this study, these threeproduction systems are first briefly introduced and then inspected assuming that they have been connected to internet and examined with considering cyber-attack point of view. Some basic solutions against cyber-attacks to the aforementioned devices are suggested. Arc furnaces. Cyber-attack prevention. Electric Current Activated Sintering. Induction furnaces. Industry 4.0.

A real-time sequential deep extreme learning machine cybersecurity intrusion detection system. In recent years, cybersecurity has attracted significant interest due to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the widespread development of computer infrastructure and systems. It is thus becoming particularly necessary to identify cyber-attacks or irregularities in the system and develop an efficient intrusion detection framework that is integral to security. Researchers have worked on developing intrusion detection models that depend on machine learning (ML) methods to address these security problems. An intelligent intrusion detection device powered by data can exploit artificial intelligence (AI), and especially ML, techniques. Accordingly, we propose in this article an intrusion detection model based on a Real-Time Sequential Deep Extreme Learning Machine Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System (RTS-DELM-CSIDS) security model. The proposed model initially determines the rating of security aspects contributing to their significance and then develops a comprehensive intrusion detection framework focused on the essential characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of our proposed RTS-DELM-CSIDS framework by performing dataset evaluations and calculating accuracy parameters to validate. The experimental findings demonstrate that the RTS-DELM-CSIDS framework outperforms conventional algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed approach has not only research significance but also practical significance. DELM. Intrusion detection system. Machine learning. Security. 
Reviewing the effectiveness of artificial intelligence techniques against cyber security risks. The rapid increase in malicious cyber-criminal activities has made the field of cybersecurity a crucial research discipline. Over the areas, the advancement in information technology has enabled cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks that can endanger cybersecurity. Due to this, traditional cybersecurity solutions have become ineffective against emerging cyberattacks. However, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) – particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) – and cryptographic techniques have shown promising results in countering the evolving cyber threats caused by adversaries. Therefore, in this study, AI's potential in enhancing cybersecurity solutions is discussed. Additionally, the study has provided an in-depth analysis of different AI-based techniques that can detect, analyse, and prevent cyber threats. In the end, the present study has also discussed future research opportunities that are linked with the development of AI systems in the field of cybersecurity.

Do voluntary disclosures mitigate the cybersecurity breach contagion effect?. In this study, we investigate the negative impact of a cybersecurity breach on a bystander (i.e., non-breached) firm in the same industry, referred to as investment contagion effects, and whether voluntary cybersecurity disclosures mitigate these effects. Using an experiment with nonprofessional investors, we provide strong evidence of investment contagion effects. However, we also find a portion of investor participants perceive the breach as positive news for the bystander firm, a phenomenon known as competition effects. Our evidence suggests contagion effects are dominant over competition effects, and cybersecurity disclosures provided prior to the breach announcement attenuate contagion effects. Additionally, we find cybersecurity disclosures provided subsequent to the breach announcement can reduce the magnitude of investment contagion effects. Our study informs standard setters and firms as we find some evidence that voluntary disclosures are effective in lessening investment contagion effects. Contagion effects. Cybersecurity. Disclosure.

Cybersecurity, Technological Neutrality, and International Trade Law. There have already been several studies focusing on cybersecurity and international trade but the intersection between the two is multifaceted and can be approached from several viewpoints. This article focuses on cybersecurity and international trade from the specific perspective of technological neutrality. Although technological neutrality is recognized with different degrees of intensity both under World Trade Organization Covered Agreements and free trade agreements in a diverse range of fields (such as trade in services, technical barriers to trade, or intellectual property), its status in international trade law is unclear. In this uncertain context, it is argued here, technological neutrality has the potential of expanding the scope of trade obligations unpredictably. As a result, in the face of pressing cybersecurity concerns, technology-related trade measures risk to constantly violate trade obligations, making the trade-cybersecurity relationship even more complicated. The possibility to clarify the status of technological neutrality and the scope of technology-neutral provisions is chief among the solutions proposed in this article. Additionally, this article suggests for States either to be compensated when a trade-restrictive cybersecurity measure affects them, or to consider adopting a waiver in the field of technology, similar to what has been carried out in other areas. 
Creating Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs from Malware after Action Reports. After Action Reports (AARs) provide incisive analysis of cyber-incidents. Extracting cyber-knowledge from these sources would provide security analysts with credible information, which they can use to detect or find patterns indicative of a cyber-attack. In this paper, we describe a system to extract information from AARs, aggregate the extracted information by fusing similar entities together, and represent that extracted information in a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG). We extract entities by building a customized named entity recognizer called 'Malware Entity Extractor' (MEE). We then build a neural network to predict how pairs of 'malware entities' are related to each other. When we have predicted entity pairs and the relationship between them, we assert the 'entity-relationship set' in a CKG. Our next step in the process is to fuse similar entities, to improve our CKG. This fusion helps represent intelligence extracted from multiple documents and reports. The fused CKG has knowledge from multiple AARs, with relationships between entities extracted from separate reports. As a result of this fusion, a security analyst can execute queries and retrieve better answers on the fused CKG, than a knowledge graph with no fusion. We also showcase various reasoning capabilities that can be leveraged by a security analyst using our fused CKG. after action reports.

Metaphor co-creation in reframing cybersecurity issues [La co-creación de metáforas en la reformulación de problemas de ciberseguridad]. The paper substantiates the explanatory and interpretative potential of analogical reasoning in resolving the ambiguity of defining cybersecurity. By applying cognitive linguistics and corpus linguistics methods, it presents an attempt to showcase how the metaphor co-creation strategy may be helpful in reframing the discourse around cybersecurity dominated by inapt metaphors. The latter, in their turn, prompt wrong inferences, which ultimately results in false decisions about the nature of cyber vulnerabilities. The comparison of the conversational valence introduced by professional audience and laymen involved in the campaign of co-creating new metaphor-based utterances reveals how it channels the cybersecurity discourse, and is followed by outlining the implications of applying the newly created metaphors.

A Study of Chinese Policy Attention on Cybersecurity. The rising number of cyberattacks and cybercriminals around the world has put major threats on the cybersecurity and even the national security of many countries. In response, governments started to introduce policies and regulations to improve cybersecurity. It is increasingly realized that effective cybersecurity policy making largely depends upon optimized policy attention and the effective use of public resources. This article draws on the &#x201C. attention-driven policy choice model&#x201D. and the punctuated equilibrium theory to analyze the relationship between policy attention allocation, policy agenda setting, and the choice of policy tools in different periods of cybersecurity development. Using Chinese cybersecurity development as the main context, content analysis of policy texts was conducted to examine the pathway of cybersecurity policy development in China between 1994 and 2019. The findings suggest that there is evidence for punctuated equilibrium with policy stagnation and incrementality being broken up by major events which shift policy attention and subsequently affects agenda setting and the choice of policy tools. The findings of this article will provide important implications for the development of strategic foresight of cybersecurity and the effective use of public resources to improve cybersecurity. IEEE.

Intelligence-led response: Turning theory into law enforcement practice in cyber security incidents. As the internet grows drastically in scale and density, the number of cyber security incidents investigated by law enforcement agencies (LEAs) is skyrocketing. Criminals may deny committing a crime, but LEAs are hindered in proving it by the limited processing capabilities of human analysis. While initial crime scene investigation emphasises finding actionable intelligence as quickly as possible, lab forensics focuses on reconstructing the case and cross-referencing the evidence to find the truth. Both are critical parts of the investigative response to cyber security incidents. This paper presents a practical digital forensic framework based on ISO/IEC 27043: 2015 activities, intended to handle digital evidence at the crime scene and lessen the caseload burden at the lab. By advocating an intelligence-led response to crime scene investigation and lab forensics, we aim to turn theory into practice for LEAs, supporting the resolution of cyber security incidents and the understanding of what happened. By working through the different processes and activities in practical exercises, we aim to enable LEAs to implement a response strategy for combating cyber crime. Copyright . Cyber security.

Cyber security incident and its reporting as part of personal data protection in the context of the internet of things [Kybernetický bezpečnostní incident a jeho ohlašování... v rámci zabezpečení osobních údajů v kontextu internetu věcí]. Thecontributionisfocusedonthepremisethatinthemodern,increasinglyinterconnectedsociety,thereisagrowing content overlap of notification obligations following from the legal frameworks of personal data protection and cyber security. In both cases, this is a reflection of smart regulation, where the state uses the possibilities offered by information and communication technologies to gather up-to-date information on situations that may require a response from supervisory authorities. In the case of the obligation to notify personal data breaches pursuant to Article 33 of General Regulation No. 2016/679, on the protection of personal data, towards the Office for Personal Data Protection, the interference with the processed personal data is decisive. The obligation to report a cyber security incident pursuant to Section 8 of Act No. 181/2014 Sb., On cyber security, to the relevant CERT, arises upon interference with the information infrastructure elements of the obliged entities. Due to the gradual digitization of an increasing number of activities and the associated ubiquitous processing of personal data, these perspectives are increasingly overlapping. The author perceives this development as an opportunity to modify the future legal framework in a way, which can increase the benefit from the information communicated to supervisory authorities for all concerned.

Adapting CTF challenges into virtual cybersecurity learning environments. Purpose: This paper aims to highlight the potential of using capture the flag (CTF) challenges, as part of an engaging cybersecurity learning experience for enhancing skills and knowledge acquirement of undergraduate students in academic programs. Design/methodology/approach: The approach involves integrating interactivity, gamification, self-directed and collaborative learning attributes using a CTF hosting platform for cybersecurity education. The proposed methodology includes the deployment of a pre-engagement survey for selecting the appropriate CTF challenges in accordance with the skills and preferences of the participants. During the learning phase, storytelling elements were presented, while a behavior rubric was constructed to observe the participants’ behavior and responses during a five-week lab. Finally, a survey was created for getting feedback from the students and for extracting quantitative results based on the attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction (ARCS) model of motivational design. Findings: Students felt more confident about their skills and were highly engaged to the learning process. The outcomes in terms of technical skills and knowledge acquisition were shown to be positive. Research limitations/implications: As the number of participants was small, the results and information retrieved from applying the ARCS model only have an indicative value. however, specific challenges to overcome are highlighted which are important for the future deployments. Practical implications: Educators could use the proposed approach for deploying an engaging cybersecurity learning experience in an academic program, emphasizing on providing hands-on practice labs and featuring topics from real-world cybersecurity cases. Using the proposed approach, an educator could also monitor the progress of the participants and get qualitative and quantitative statistics regarding the learning impact for each exercise. Social implications: Educators could demonstrate modern cybersecurity topics in the classroom, closing further the gap between theory and practice. As a result, students from academia will benefit from the proposed approach by acquiring technical skills, knowledge and experience through hands-on practice in real-world cases. Originality/value: This paper intends to bridge the existing gap between theory and practice in the topics of cybersecurity by using CTF challenges for learning purposes and not only for testing the participants’ skills. This paper offers important knowledge for enhancing cybersecurity education programs and for educators to use CTF challenges for conducting cybersecurity exercises in academia, extracting meaningful statistics regarding the learning impact.

Review of pedagogical principles of cyber security exercises. Modern digitalized cyber domains are extremely complex ensemble. Cyber attacks or incidents against system may affect capricious effects for another system or even for physical devices. For understanding and training to encounter those effects requires an effective and complex simulation capability. Cyber Security Exercises are an effective expedient for training and learning measures and operations with their outcomes in that complex cyber domain. Learning in cyber security exercises is relevant for different level actors in organisation hierarchy. Technical experts are able to train the technical capabilities whereas decision makers are able to train the decision-making capabilities under hectic cyber incident. In this paper, the pedagogical aspects of cyber security exercises are discussed in accordance with the law of the lifecycle of the cyber security exercise: planning phase, implementation phase, and feedback phase.

Cybersecurity and global regulatory challenges. Purpose: This study aims to define objectively what are the elements that should be considered in the repositioning of international cooperation, less under its value, which is unquestionable, but more under the optics of the procedure, how can it be operationalized. International cooperation goes beyond the regulatory effort, which, although an important step, is insufficient. It is inserted in an environment in which there is a multiplicity of forces and instances, non-converging and tensioned. At the same time, in the authors’ view, it is not about cooperation between states or between states and international organizations only, it must understand the private sector equally, which has the expressive property of the technologies used. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an interdisciplinary approach, and the method of analysis is the typothetical deductive. Findings: Cybersecurity as a global and complex issue demands cooperation between nations, but also the private sector and civil society engagement. It also demands a good governance in the decision making process, more integrated, accurated and precised. Originality/value: This study is original, and it represents a special concern and vision from professional and academic fields. Cyber cooperation. Cybersecurity. Governance. Regulatory challenges.

Analysis of past cybersecurity-related incidents in the process industry and the like. The process industry and similar sectors are undergoing a digital transition towards higher levels of automation. This, while ensuring advantages such as efficient process control, quick and safe response to abnormal conditions, improvement of product quality and continuous process optimization, it exposes the process sites to cybersecurity threats. A cyber-attack, besides economic and reputation damages, can potentially trigger major accidents (e.g. loss of containment of hazardous materials) with severe consequences on workers, population and the environment. In the present study, the cybersecurity-related incidents (CSIs) that occurred in the chemical, petrochemical, energy production, and water/wastewater sectors, were investigated. The analysis is based on the development of a database of 78 cybersecurity-related incidents. The aim of the study is to frame a clear picture of the cyber-attacks on IT-OT (Information Technology-Operational Technology) system of process facilities and to issue lessons learnt from past incidents. 
ALICE: a hybrid AI paradigm with enhanced connectivity and cybersecurity for a serendipitous encounter with circulating hybrid cells. A fully automated and accurate assay of rare cell phenotypes in densely-packed fluorescently-labeled liquid biopsy images remains elusive. Methods: Employing a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm that combines traditional rule-based morphological manipulations with modern statistical machine learning, we deployed a next generation software, ALICE (Automated Liquid Biopsy Cell Enumerator) to identify and enumerate minute amounts of tumor cell phenotypes bestrewed in massive populations of leukocytes. As a code designed for futurity, ALICE is armed with internet of things (IOT) connectivity to promote pedagogy and continuing education and also, an advanced cybersecurity system to safeguard against digital attacks from malicious data tampering. Results: By combining robust principal component analysis, random forest classifier and cubic support vector machine, ALICE was able to detect synthetic, anomalous and tampered input images with an average recall and precision of 0.840 and 0.752, respectively. In terms of phenotyping enumeration, ALICE was able to enumerate various circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes with a reliability ranging from 0.725 (substantial agreement) to 0.961 (almost perfect) as compared to human analysts. Further, two subpopulations of circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) were serendipitously discovered and labeled as CHC-1 (DAPI+/CD45+/E-cadherin+/vimentin-) and CHC-2 (DAPI+ /CD45+/E-cadherin+/vimentin+) in the peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer patients. CHC-1 was found to correlate with nodal staging and was able to classify lymph node metastasis with a sensitivity of 0.615 (95% CI: 0.374-0.898) and specificity of 1.000 (95% CI: 1.000-1.000). Conclusion: This study presented a machine-learning-augmented rule-based hybrid AI algorithm with enhanced cybersecurity and connectivity for the automatic and flexibly-adapting enumeration of cellular liquid biopsies. ALICE has the potential to be used in a clinical setting for an accurate and reliable enumeration of CTC phenotypes. ALICE. Cell phenotyping software. Circulating hybrid cells.

Optimization model of adaptive decision taking support system for distributed systems cyber security facilities placement. An article herein presents an optimization model, designated for computational core of decision-taking support system (DTSS). DTSS is necessary for system analysis and search of optimal versions for cyber security facilities placement and information protection of an enterprise or organization distributed computational network (DCN). DTSS and a model allow automize the analysis of information protection and cyber security systems in different versions. It is possible to consider, how separate elements, influence at DCN protection factors and their combinations. Offered model, in distinction from existing, has allowed implementing both the principles of information protection equivalency to a concrete threat and a system complex approach to forming a highly effective protection system for DCN. Hereby we have presented the outcomes of computational experiments on selecting the rational program algorithm of implementing the developed optimization model. It has been offered to use genetic algorithm modification (GAM). Based on the offered model, there has been implemented the module for adaptive DTSS. DTSS module might be applied upon designing protected DCN, based on preset architecture and available sets of information protection and cyber security systems in the network. Cyber security.

Medical Device Safety Management Using Cybersecurity Risk Analysis. Hospital biomedical engineering teams are responsible for establishing and regulating medical equipment management programs (MEMPs). these programs ensure the safety and reliability of medical devices. Concomitant with rapid technological advancements, medical devices have been developed that are now being integrated with information and communication technology. However, with the convergence of such diverse technologies, internal and external security threats are continuously increasing. Thus, to reduce medical device security threats, important devices must be identified and prioritized. In this study, we propose a multicriteria decision-making model that prioritizes medical devices by extending the Fennigkoh and Smith model to include security threats. First, we formulate criteria for evaluating medical device functions based on the classification of the medical devices according to their unique functions, connections, and data types. Then, through threat modeling, we develop a method of identifying and evaluating security threats to these devices. We discuss establishing a safer MEMP by analyzing the attack occurrence probability (AOP) and attack success probability (ASP) of medical devices and the inherent security threats that these devices face, none of which are considered in the existing model. Thus, by using the enhanced Fennigkoh and Smith model, our proposed approach enables the development of improved security-enhanced MEMPs, including cybersecurity risk assessments.

An explanatory review on cybersecurity capability maturity models. Cybersecurity is growing exponentially day by day in both the public and private sectors. This growth also comes with a new and dynamic cyber-threats risk that causes both sectors' performance to halt. These sectors must update their cybersecurity measures and must understand the capability and maturity of their organization's cybersecurity preparedness. Cybersecurity maturity models are widely used to measure how ready an organization is when it comes to cybersecurity. The main aim of this article is to conduct a comprehensive review of the current cybersecurity capability maturity models using a systematic review of published articles from 2011 to 2019. A comparative study was conducted based on Halvorsen and Conradi's taxonomy. The review indicated almost all the cybersecurity maturity model consists of similar elements like maturity levels and processes but significantly lacks the validation process, it was observed each of the models were predominantly designed for a specific purpose and also for different organization size and application domain.

A new cybersecurity approach for protecting cloud services against DDoS attacks. Cybersecurity of cloud services is extremely important, especially when developing web services and cloud apps. Cloud computing depends on internet connections. therefore, the security of its services is constantly under attack. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a malicious attempt to damage the normal traffic of the targeted cloud by flooding it with internet traffic. As a result, this causes a serious problem for cloud computing security. The objectives of this paper are, to introduce a new cybersecurity approach for protecting cloud services against all types of DDoS attacks, to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and to use the contribution of correlation coefficient analysis for validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach by identifying the relationship between malicious and legitimate traffic. The researcher evaluated the performance of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The feedback of the experiments was highly promising for protecting cloud services against DDoS Attacks. The experiments showed encouraging results for preventing DDoS attacks, with an average performance of 95.41%, an average accuracy of 96.53%, an average sensitivity of 92.31%, and an average specificity of 97.39%.

Cybercrime is very dangerous form of criminal behavior and cybersecurity. Computer crime is a form of criminal behavior in which the use of computer technology and information systems is manifested as a mode of crime or the computer is used as a means or purpose of perpetration with which is producing some relevant criminal consequence. Computer crime is also an unlawful violation of property in which computer data is intentionally altered (manipulated by a computer), destroyed (computer sabotaged) or used in conjunction with hardware (theft of time). Objective of this paper is consideration of using new computer technology in everyday life. Unfortunately, some users using new technology for criminal acts. For Analysis, author use official resources from books, scientific papers and online resources. Even though it is a new technology, police and justice successfully deal with different types of computercrimes. Crime. Cybersecurity. Hacking. Threats. 
Evaluating case study and action research reports: Real-world research in cybersecurity. There is a growing number of scientific papers reporting on case studies and action research published each year. Consequently, evaluating the quality of pilling up research reports is becoming increasingly challenging. Several approaches for evaluation of quality of the scientific outputs exist however they appear to be fairly time-consuming and/or adapted for other research designs. In this paper, we propose a reasonably light-weight structure-based approach for evaluating case study and action research reports (SAE-CSAR) based on eight key parts of a real-world research report: Research question, case description, data collection, data analysis, ethical considerations, results, discussion and limitations. To evaluate the feasibility of theproposed approach, we conducted a systematic literature survey of papers reporting on real-world cybersecurity research. A total of N = 102 research papers were evaluated. Results suggest that SAE-CSAR is useful and relatively efficient, and may offer a thought-provoking insight into the studied field. Although there is a positive trend for the inclusion of data collection, data analysis and research questions in papers, there is still room for improvement suggesting that the field of real-world cybersecurity research did not mature yet. The presence of a discussion in a paper appears to affect most its citation count. However, it seems that it is not uniformly accepted what a discussion should include. This paper explores this and other issues related to paper structure and provides guidance on how to improve the quality of research reports. Article. Assessment. Conference proceedings. Context.

Optimisation of industry revolution 4.0 implementation strategy for palm oil industry in cyber security. Palm oil has been one of the major renewable sources for the production of energy, food, and chemicals. Despite the huge demand and production rate, the majority of the stakeholders consist of small and medium enterprise company, especially at the plantation site. Due to this, revolution of industry 4.0 in palm oil industry, especially the upstream process is a very challenging issue. Stakeholders are reluctant to move toward the new technology due to the lack of understanding of the potential features and advantages, as well as hesitate to invest in new technology. This paper proposed a novel mathematical model to evaluate potential Industry Revolution 4.0 features based on existing technologies and optimised implementation strategy for each stakeholder. Each potential feature was evaluated based on its potential impact, estimated investment cost and non-implement penalty cost. The model covers a long-term operation to consider the inflation rate and dynamic maturity of each feature. A case study focusing on cybersecurity features is discussed and the result shows that only 7 out of 16 features that are feasible to implement in oil palm industry, where blockchain and smart contract are the most promising features to be implemented. All the features are recommended to be implemented at a later stage due to the increasing maturity of the Industry 4.0 technologies and cheaper cost. 
Hacking cybersecurity law. Unlike discrete legal fields such as patent and copyright law, cybersecurity law spans a number of sections of the U.S. Code, as well as state and international laws. Because the contours of cybersecurity law are blurry, U.S. policymakers have not sufficiently determined how to most effectively align statutes and regulations with current cybersecurity threats. This Article builds on the author's previous work to define the scope of cybersecurity law and suggests seven guiding principles to radically reshape-or hack-the legal system to better address current and future cybersecurity threats. This Article draws on legal scholarship and other fields of law to derive high-level goals for policymakers as they seek to make cybersecurity law more effective, cohesive, and agile. 
Cyber Security Measures for Internet of Things Devices. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that integrates the Internet and physical objects belonging to different domains such as home automation, industrial process, human health and environmental monitoring. It is intended for ubiquitous connectivity among different entities or things. It can be seen as a pervasive network of networks: numerous heterogeneous entities both physical and virtual interconnected with any other entity or entities through unique addressing schemes, interacting with each other to provide/request all kinds of services. It deepens the presence of Internet-connected devices in our daily activities, bringing, in addition to many benefits, challenges related to security issues. The number of devices connected along with the ad-hoc nature of the system further exacerbates the situation. Therefore, security and privacy has emerged as a significant challenge for the IoT. This research work focuses on the security aspects of IoT and proposes security solutions for mitigation of the concerns. Cyber-attacks. DDoS. Internet of Things (IoT). IoT security.

Cyber security concerns in social networking service. Today's world is unimaginable without online social networks. Nowadays, millions of people connect with their friends and families by sharing their personal information with the help of different forms of social media. Sometimes, individuals face different types of issues while maintaining the multimedia contents like, audios, videos, photos because it is difficult to maintain the security and privacy of these multimedia contents uploaded on a daily basis. In fact, sometimes personal or sensitive information could get viral if that leaks out even unintentionally. Any leaked out content can be shared and made a topic of popular talk all over the world within few seconds with the help of the social networking sites. In the setting of Internet of Things (IoT) that would connect millions of devices, such contents could be shared from anywhere anytime. Considering such a setting, in this work, we investigate the key security and privacy concerns faced by individuals who use different social networking sites differently for different reasons. We also discuss the current state-of-the-art defense mechanisms that can bring somewhat long-term solutions to tackling these threats. Cyber. Internet. Network. Security. Social. Threat. 
Cyber security: Between challenges and prospects. This research studies the severe challenges facing cyber security which are thrown due to the growth of Internet technology. In this paper, cyber security is studied in a wide range of domains, from infrastructure, to networks, to databases, to applica-tions, to identity and access management, as well as cloud systems and the Internet of Things. Bridging the gaps between these domains has become essential to address cyber security risks. Different focus by each organization and provider in the Cyberspace on relevant security domains has resulted in a disjointed state of security for the Cyberspace. Furthermore, a Disaster Recovery plan needs to be firmly in place as part of an overall Business Continuity Strategy to mitigate loss and disruption. Therefore, the search for methods to ensure cyber security, as well as the development of appropriate technolo-gies, has become an important aspect of the IT sector. In conclusion, cyber security is a complex subject whose understanding requires knowledge and expertise from multiple disciplines, including but not limited to computer science and information technology, psychology, economics, organizational behavior, political science, engineering, sociology, decision sciences, international relations, and law.

Cybersecurity analysis using the blockchain algorithm in nuclear power plants to enhance safe operations. The blockchain technology has been applied to nuclear power plants in which the cyber performance using the security analysis information is highly enhanced. Following this study, other kinds of information in the nuclear stuff could be applied using the blockchain technology. The simulations are performed as the conventional with system dynamics (SD) and blockchain modified modeling. The blockchain quantifications are done for conventional algorithm and SD as the highest value is 2.0. In addition, the encryption analysis is done, which is obtained by the hash code with the modulus algorithm that the remainder is calculated. For example, in the case of Long-term Conduction, the highest value is 0.6. After taking the information of hash code, the decoding could be accomplished. The networking bodies have same information and can take the secured information. blockchain. cyber. hash code. Nuclear security. system. 
A general view of industry 4.0 revolution from cybersecurity perspective. The broad network and high-level data sharing that comes with Industry 4.0 will rapidly increase the companies' cyber security demands due to its vulnerabilities and new emerging threats. Therefore, large corporations need a risk management system and security strategy tailored to its safety needs and is committed to improving operational security and protection so that their operations and earnings are not adversely affected. In order to protect products, data and intellectual property against unauthorized and unauthorized persons, companies must absolutely take cyber security measures and continuously improve existing security systems to comply with Industry 4.0 requirements. This paper aims to address which type of problems enterprises should handle against cyber-attacks and illustrate how governments take precaution and refer this issue at their policy documents in the era of industry 4.0. The digitalization of production has paved the way for an ever-increasing existence of concepts such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, 3-D Printing, Augmented Reality, and Internet of Things in production. With the emergence of these concepts, the need for cyber security is also becoming crucial. This paper underlines many issues from the literature survey and comprehensive risk analysis by comparing modern history of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and future smart factories. Some problems are also addressed with different case studies for possible solutions. Cybersecurity. E-government. Industry 4.0. IoT. Smart cities. 
Cybersecurity Convergence: Digital Human and National Security. Over the past decade, people everywhere have become as dependent on the virtual world for their daily activities as they are dependent on the physical world for human activities. Global fiber optic networks have enabled communication in an unprecedented manner, connecting people in unique ways, propelling global supply chains, and giving consumers access to a variety of data from around the world. The online world is threatened by interstate rivals that engage in influence operations, economic espionage, and intelligence gathering and criminal groups that steal identities, ransom data, and grow their enterprises. Insiders facilitate intrusions wittingly and unwittingly raising the importance of corporations’ roles in cybersecurity. This convergence between the virtual and physical worlds with the government and the corporate upends the entire frame of reference for national security, which is tilted toward physical attack and strict jurisdictional lines. As cybersecurity integrates further into U.S. national security, a new approach is needed to incorporate a human security construct at the user level. This article is adapted from their forthcoming book, Security in the Cyber Age from Georgetown University Press. The views expressed are their own. 
Identification of cybersecurity specific content using different language models. Given the sheer amount of digital texts publicly available on the Internet, it becomes more challenging for security analysts to identify cyber threat related content. In this research, we proposed to build an autonomous system to identify cyber threat information from publicly available information sources. We examined different language models to utilize as a cybersecurity-specific filter for the proposed system. Using the domain-specific training data, we trained Doc2Vec and BERT models and compared their performance. According to our evaluation, the BERT-based Natural Language Filter is able to identify and classify cybersecurity-specific natural language text with 90% accuracy. Cyber threat. NLP.

Application of Algorithmic Cognitive Decision Trust Modeling for Cyber Security Within Organisations. Cybercrime continues to cause increasing threat to business processes, eroding stakeholders&#x2019. trust in Internet technologies. In this article, we explore how six dominant algorithmic trust positions facilitate cognitive processing, which, in turn, can influence an organization&#x0027. s productivity and align its values and support structures for combating cybercrimes. This conceptual paper uses a cognitive perspective described as a throughput model. This modeling perspective captures several dominant algorithmic trust positions for organizations, providing a new, and powerful approach which seeks to enhance our understanding of the cognitive representation of decision-making processes. These trust positions are rational-based trust, rule-based trust, category-based trust, third-party based trust, role-based trust, and knowledge-based trust. Finally, we provide conclusion and implications for future research. IEEE. cognitive processing. Cybercrime. decision-making model. fraud triangle. throughput model. trust pathways. 
Cybersecurity challenges associated with the internet of things in a post-quantum world. The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm connecting billions of devices securely to the Internet. Another emerging paradigm is quantum computing which - while opening new compute opportunities - was shown to jeopardise most cybersecurity protocols. In this study, we discuss techniques able to provide security in a post-quantum IoT. Specifically, we examine how the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) IoT security solutions fair in a post-quantum environment. Also, we analyse the security features of fifth-generation (5G) networks, propose improvements and discuss the manner in which a quantum computer can compromise security. Our results prove the existence of multiple vulnerabilities in the current IoT architecture and implementations. With advances in quantum computing having rendered the current security algorithms unsafe, more advanced techniques should be established to mitigate such risks. To this end, we present promising lattice-driven cryptographic techniques which we prove quantum resistance. 3GPP. 5G networks. asymmetric algorithms. cryptography. IoT. lattice-based cryptography.

Supply chain and logistics management and an open door policy concerning cyber security introduction. The need for integrity and reliability in the supply chain and logistics management operations has a well-established array of theoretical frameworks that guide organizations and managers in the field. However, what is missing is a comprehensive, established framework for logistics and supply chain cybersecurity. The emerging area of cyber-supply chain security continues to lack suitable models to help secure critical data and systems. In all industries and fields today, cybersecurity is no longer just an information technology issue. It is a business sustainability and business strategy issue. The human factors in the cyber-supply chain operations represent the actions or events when human error results in a successful hack or data breach. Today, protecting logistics and supply chain organizations from cyber and data security risks is no longer just an information technology employee function. Every organizational employee has a responsibility in the data protection process. Progressive organizations are ones that can create methods, policies, and approaches that encourage employees to play an active role in the information and cybersecurity process. This paper explores innovative approaches around open-door systems as a proactive data security and cybersecurity risk reduction organizational strategy. This research provides cyber-supply chain practitioners and scholars an array of concepts to help them understand and describe the dynamics of cyber-supply chain and logistics management data security vulnerabilities and opportunities for process improvements.

Maximizing employee compliance with cybersecurity policies. IT executives are well aware that formal policies are fundamental to combatting insider cybersecurity threats but struggle to achieve adequate levels of policy compliance from employees. This article identifies which practices for promoting compliance are effective and ineffective and provides actionable recommendations for maximizing employee compliance. Following these recommendations will enable organizations to derive more value from their cybersecurity investments and reduce the financial, reputational and legal risks associated with data breaches and network intrusions. 
Cyber security defence policies: A proposed guidelines for organisations cyber security practices. Many organisations have been struggling to defend their cyberspace without a specific direction or guidelines to follow and they have described and identified cyber attack as a devastating potential on business operation in a broader perspective. Since then, researchers in cyber security have come out with numerous reports on threats and attack on organisations. This study is conducted to develop and propose a Cyber Security Defence Policies (CSDP) by harmonising and synthesizing the existing practices identified from the literature review. Observation and questionnaire were adopted to evaluate, review and collect data under ethical agreement from 10 organisations. The validation is based on the principal components for the proposed CSDP and the proposed CSDP, using SPSS as the statistical tool. The result shows that, the validation of the proposed CSDP by 20 experts reveals a standard deviation of 0.607, 0.759, 0.801, 0.754, 0.513, 0.587 and 0.510 on each of the principal components without a missing value respectively. While the correlation matrix and the reproduced correlation matrix for the proposed CSDP indicated 61% and the percentage of acceptance on the principal components for the proposed CSDP are higher than 50%. Therefore, from the outcome, it has shown that the acceptance responds towards the proposed CSDP and the result from the principal components analysis (eigenvalue analysis) are significant enough for implementation and can be adopted by organisations as a guidelines for organisation cyber security practices.

Cyber security skills of pre-service teachers as a factor in computer-assisted education. The present study aimed to determine the effect of individual cyber security skills of pre-service teachers on their attitudes towards computer-assisted education. Thus, the present research was designed as a correlational study. The study participants included 241 senior pre-service teachers in different departments at Manisa Celal Bayar University, Faculty of Education during the 2019-2020 academic year the fall semester. The data were collected with the Personal Cyber Security Provision Scale and The Attitude Toward Computer-Assisted Education Scale. Based on the study findings, pre-service teachers should improve their competency in cyber security. Furthermore, pre-service teachers who owned a personal computer had higher scores in maintaining personal cyber security and had better attitudes towards computer-assisted education. Besides, it was observed that there were differences between personal cyber security scores of pre-service teachers and their attitudes towards computer-assisted education based on their departments. Furthermore, it was identified that the personal cyber security achievement score was a significant predictor of the attitude towards computer-assisted education. In the final section of the study, various recommendations are presented for future studies and applications on the subject. Attitude. Computer-assisted education. Personal cyber security.

Framing cyber security in taiwan: A perspective of discursive knowledge production. In 2019, the Tsai Ing-wen administration in Taiwan successfully amended the National Security Act as a protective measure against threats in cyberspace. However, Taiwan has perceived itself under China’s cyber-attacks since 1999, yet it is only the Tsai administration that was able to mobilize substantial resources to counter this threat. To understand what has been different in her endeavor, this paper investigated this historical development in the discourse of Taiwan’s cyber security via the analytical framework of securitization. It argues that the improvement of Taiwan’s cyber posture under Tsai is not due to the previous administrations’ ignorance of cyber threats but is due to the unique context that enables discursive practices of knowledge production during the Tsai administration to deliver a more convincing claim. The investigation further provides cautious notes on the potential adverse effect of this securitization. Constructivism. Cyber security. Framing. Securitization. Speech acts. 
Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity: A Systematic Mapping of Literature. Due to the ever-increasing complexities in cybercrimes, there is the need for cybersecurity methods to be more robust and intelligent. This will make defense mechanisms to be capable of making real-time decisions that can effectively respond to sophisticated attacks. To support this, both researchers and practitioners need to be familiar with current methods of ensuring cybersecurity (CyberSec). In particular, the use of artificial intelligence for combating cybercrimes. However, there is lack of summaries on artificial intelligent methods for combating cybercrimes. To address this knowledge gap, this study sampled 131 articles from two main scholarly databases (ACM digital library and IEEE Xplore). Using a systematic mapping, the articles were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. It was observed that artificial intelligent methods have made remarkable contributions to combating cybercrimes with significant improvement in intrusion detection systems. It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines. The findings also revealed that majority of the studies were published in two journal outlets. It is therefore suggested that to enhance research in artificial intelligence for CyberSec, researchers need to adopt newer techniques and also publish in other related outlets.

A Smart Agent Design for Cyber Security Based on Honeypot and Machine Learning. The development of Internet and social media contributes to multiplying the data produced on the Internet and the connected nodes, but the default installation and the configuration of variety of software systems represent some security holes and shortcomings, while the majority of Internet users have not really set up safety awareness, leading to huge security risks. With the development of network attack techniques, every host on the Internet has become the target of attacks. Therefore, the network information security cannot be ignored as a problem. To deal with 0-day and future attacks, the honeypot technique can be used not only passively as an information system, but also to reinforce the traditional defense systems against future attacks. In this paper, we present an introduction of machine learning and honeypot systems, and based on these technologies, we design a smart agent for cyber-attack prevention and prediction. 
A Systematic Approach for Cybersecurity Design of In-Vehicle Network Systems with Trade-Off Considerations. With the increasing connectivity of modern vehicles, protecting systems from attacks on cyber is becoming crucial and urgent. Meanwhile, a vehicle should guarantee a safe and comfortable trip for users. Therefore, how to design a cybersecurity-critical system in vehicles with safety and user experience (UX) considerations is increasingly essential. However, most co-design methods focus on safety engineering with attack concerns and do not discuss conflicts and integration, and few contain the UX aspect. Besides, most existing approaches are abstract at a high level without practical guidelines. This paper presents a literature review of existing safety and security design approaches and proposes a systematic approach for cybersecurity design of in-vehicle network systems based on the guideline in SAE J3061. The trade-off analysis is performed by using association keys and the proposed affecting map. The design process of an example Diagnostic on Internet Protocol (DoIP) system is reported to show how the approach works. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed one considers safety, cybersecurity, and UX simultaneously, solves conflicts qualitatively or quantitatively, and obtains trade-off design requirements. This approach is applicable to the cybersecurity-driven design of in-vehicle network systems in the early stage with safety and UX considerations. 
Integrating cost-benefit analysis into the NIST cybersecurity framework via the gordon-loeb model. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework has rapidly become a widely accepted approach to facilitating cybersecurity risk management within organizations. An insightful aspect of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is its explicit recognition that the activities associated with managing cybersecurity risk are organization specific. The NIST Framework also recognizes that organizations should evaluate their cybersecurity risk management on a cost-benefit basis. The NIST Framework, however, does not provide guidance on how to carry out such a cost-benefit analysis. This article provides an approach for integrating cost-benefit analysis into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Gordon-Loeb (GL) Model for cybersecurity investments is proposed as a basis for deriving a cost-effective level of spending on cybersecurity activities and for selecting the appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. The analysis shows that the GL Model provides a logical approach to use when considering the cost-benefit aspects of cybersecurity investments during an organization's process of selecting the most appropriate NIST Implementation Tier level. In addition, the cost-benefit approach provided in this article helps to identify conditions under which there is an incentive to move to a higher NIST Implementation Tier. Cybersecurity economics.

Prosumer Nanogrids: A Cybersecurity Assessment. Nanogrids are customer deployments that can generate and inject electricity into the power grid. These deployments are based on behind-the-meter renewable energy resources and are labeled as 'prosumer setups', allowing customers to not only consume electricity, but also produce it. A residential nanogrid is comprised of a physical layer that is a household-scale electric power system, and a cyber layer that is used by manufacturers and/or grid operators to remotely monitor and control the nanogrid. With the increased penetration of renewable energy resources, nanogrids are at the forefront of a paradigm shift in the operational landscape and their correct operation is vital to the electric power grid. In this paper, we perform a cybersecurity assessment of a state-of-the art residential nanogrid deployment. For this purpose, we deployed a real-world experimental nanogrid setup that is based on photovoltaic (PV) generation. We analyzed the security and the resiliency of this system at both the cyber and physical layers. While we noticed improvements in the cybersecurity measures employed in the current nanogrid compared to previous generations, there are still major concerns. Our experiments show that these concerns range from exploiting well-known protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Domain Name Service (DNS), to the leakage of confidential information, and major shortcomings in the software updating mechanism. While the compromise of multiple nanogrids can have a negative effect on the entire power grid, we focus our analysis on individual households and have determined through Simulink-based simulations the economic loss of a compromised deployment.

A Brute-Force Black-Box Method to Attack Machine Learning-Based Systems in Cybersecurity. Machine learning algorithms are widely utilized in cybersecurity. However, recent studies show that machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This poses new threats to the security-critical applications in cybersecurity. Currently, there is still a short of study on adversarial examples in the domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we propose a new method known as the brute-force attack method to better evaluate the robustness of the machine learning classifiers in cybersecurity against adversarial examples. The proposed method, which works in a black-box way and covers some shortages of the existing adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, is simple to implement and only needs the output of the target classifiers to generate adversarial examples. To have a comprehensive evaluation of the attack performance of the proposed method, we use our method to generate adversarial examples against the common machine learning based security systems in cybersecurity including host intrusion detection systems, Android malware detection systems, and network intrusion detection systems. We compare the attack performance of the proposed method against these security systems with that of state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method, which is more efficient in computation and outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, can be used to evaluate the robustness of various machine learning based systems in cybersecurity against adversarial examples.

Hyperledger blockchain design for sharing, spreading, and protecting national cybersecurity information. Real cyberterrors are invisible and difficult to identify. Even after a cyberattack, its origin and cause are difficult to determine. Cyberterrorism results in invisible cyberwars, and it is believed that World War IV will begin with a cyberwarfare. For national cybersecurity, information on cybersecurity must be collected, shared, and disseminated. In this study, we investigate a blockchain system designed based on the World Cybersecurity Agreement. National cybersecurity information is linked to the hyperledger blockchain system network through the National Cybersecurity Center. National cybersecurity information designs and uses a secure protocol for protection. further, it is collected, shared, and disseminated to treaty countries. National cybersecurity information is shared and spread by the hyperledger blockchain system, and it uses a cyberdefense system that responds to the cyberattacks and their origin. This paper serves as a policy and legislation guideline for forming a World Cybersecurity Agreement between countries. Blockchain. National cybersecurity. Protecting. Sharing.

Modeling the Effect of Spending on Cyber Security by Using Surplus Process. In this paper, we assume the security level of a system is a quantifiable metric and apply the insurance company ruin theory in assessing the defense failure frequencies. The current security level of an information system can be viewed as the initial insurer surplus. defense investment can be viewed as premium income resulting in an increase in the security level. cyberattack arrivals follow a Poisson process, and the impact of attacks is modeled as losses on the security level. The occurrence of cyber breach is modeled as a ruin event. We use this framework to determine optimal investment in cyber security that minimizes the total cyber costs. We show by numerical examples that there is an optimal allocation of total cyber security budget to (1) IT security maintenance/upkeep spending versus (2) external cyber risk transfer. 
Digital forensics in cyber security-recent trends, threats, and opportunities. The rapid technological advancement has led the entire world to shift towards digital domain. However, this transition has also result in the emergence of cybercrimes and security breach incidents that threatens the privacy and security of the users. Therefore, this paper aimed at examining the use of digital forensics in countering cybercrimes, which has been a critical breakthrough in cybersecurity. The paper has analyzed the most recent trends in digital forensics, which include cloud forensics, social media forensics, and IoT forensics. These technologies are helping the cybersecurity professionals to use the digital traces left by the data storage and processing to keep data safe, while identifying the cybercriminals. However, the research has also observed specific threats to digital forensics, which include technical, operational and personnel-related challenges. The high complexity of these systems, large volume of data, chain of custody, the integrity of personnel, and the validity and accuracy of digital forensics are major threats to its large-scale use. Nevertheless, the paper has also observed the use of USB forensics, intrusion detection and artificial intelligence as major opportunities for digital forensics that can make the processes easier, efficient, and safe.

A novel ASCII code-based polybius square alphabet sequencer as enhanced cryptographic cipher for cyber security protection (APSAlpS-3CS). For all industries, cybersecurity is regarded as one of the major areas of concern that needs to be addressed. Data and information in all forms should be safeguarded to avoid leakage of information, data theft, and robbery through intruders and hackers. This paper proposes a modification on the traditional 5x5 Polybius square in cryptography, through dynamically generated matrices. The modification is done through shifting cell elements for every encrypted character using a secret key and its ASCII decimal code equivalents. The results of the study revealed that the modified Polybius cipher offers a more secure plaintext-ciphertext conversion and is difficult to break, as evident in the frequency analysis. In the proposed method, each element produced in the digraphs exhibits a wider range of possible values. However, with the increase of process in the encryption and decryption, the modified Polybius cipher obtained a longer execution time of 0.0031ms, being identified as its tradeoff. The unmodified Polybius cipher, however, obtained an execution time of 0.0005ms. Future researchers may address the execution time tradeoff of the modified Polybius cipher. Ciphers. Ciphertext.

Cyber security awareness among university students: A case study. This paper reports the preliminary outcomes of a quantitative survey intended to identify students' awareness and enthusiasm to learn cybersecurity in Nigerian Universities. The objective of the survey was to see how students in this developing country are mindful of cyber-attacks and how they can mitigate the attacks and to find out if the cybersecurity awareness program is among the University program. The preliminary results indicated that the students claimed to have basic cybersecurity knowledge, but are not well informed of how to protect their data. It also seems that most Universities do not have an active cybersecurity awareness program to improve students' knowledge on how to protect themselves from any threats. The surveyed students also show interest in learning more about cybersecurity. Cybersecurity awareness. Password Management. Two-factor authentication. 
Factors Related to Cyber Security Behavior. Theoretical and empirical insight notes that cyber security awareness is a topic of particular interest in cyber security. Humans are the central figures in cyber security and the way to reduce risk in cyberspace is to make people more security aware. While there have been numerous studies about various aspects of cyber security awareness, they are both inconsistent and environment-dependent. The main aim of our research is to analyze cyber security awareness in depth, and to try to discover how various factors such as socio-demographics, cyber security perceptions, previous cyber security breaches, IT usage, and knowledge may individually or together impact on cyber security behavior. To prove that we conducted our research on students, as they are the most technologically active part of the society. We discovered that knowledge proved to be the dominant factor for cyber security awareness, and although students are digital natives, they do not feel safe in the cyber environment. they do not behave securely and do not have adequate knowledge to protect themselves in cyberspace.

Cybersecurity, value sensing robots for LGBTIQ+ elderly, and the need for revised codes of conduct. Until now, each profession has developed their professional codes of conduct independently. However, the use of robots and artificial intelligence is blurring professional delineations: aged care nurses work with lifting robots, tablet computers, and intelligent diagnostic systems, and health information system designers work with clinical teams. While robots assist the medical staffin extending the professional service they provide, it is not clear how professions adhere and adapt to the new reality. In this article, we reflect on how the insertion of robots may shape codes of conduct, in particular with regards to cybersecurity. We do so by focusing on the use of social robots for helping LGBTIQ+ elderly cope with loneliness and depression. Using robots in such a delicate domain of application changes how care is delivered, as now alongside the caregiver, there is a cyber-physical health information system that can learn from experience and act autonomously. Our contribution stresses the importance of including cybersecurity considerations in codes of conduct for both robot developers and caregivers as it is the human and not the machine which is responsible for ensuring the system's security and the user's safety.

National cyber security strategy and the emergence of strong digital borders. The growth of the Internet and innovation that thrived with it was facilitated by an environment relatively free of controls. Regrettably, however, with its deep integration into the societal framework, the Internet has become a potent tool for influencing geopolitical conflicts, including interference in internal affairs of other nations, undermining national security, destabilizing financial infrastructure, and attacks on critical infrastructure. While countries are harvesting the social and economic benefits of the Internet, they are frightened of the threats it poses to national security. In response to these threats, countries are starting to tighten their internet borders and developing their cyber weaponry both as a deterrent to, and leverage during conflicts. A potential downside of such state-bystate regulation is inhibition of the rapid innovation that the Internet has traditionally fostered and the curtailing of freedom of speech that has led to the social integration in the society. On the other hand, innovation and freedom cannot thrive in a chaotic environment with rampant crime and a lack of rules, norms, and ethics. With this in mind, national policymakers face the challenge of striking a balance between regulation and potential chaos on the Internet while at the same time promoting freedom. In efforts to strike such a balance of national interests, borders in cyberspace have an important role to play along with international efforts to build trust in cyberspace and to slow down the fragmentation of the Internet. This article discusses how cyber conflicts are escalating, how mutual distrust is growing, and how nation-states are adapting to the constantly changing cyber domain. Critical infrastructure.

Discussion of audit Firm Assessments of Cyber-Security Risk: Evidence from Audit Fees and SEC Comment Letters. The study by Rosati, Gogolin, and Lynn (in this issue) examines the impact of cyber-security incidents on audit fees. Using audit fee as a proxy for audit effort and risk, it takes 168 cyber-security incidents during 2005-2014 that are collected by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and documents that breached firms are charged higher audit fees. In addition, the authors find that the increase in audit fee is only temporary and exists during the t-1 to t+1 window surrounding the breach. Finally, this study also finds that the audit fee increases post SEC comment letters that are related to cyber-security incidents. Overall, my assessment of the paper is that it is well executed and well written. More importantly, it adheres well to its stated research question. The following are my written comments, which are based on my discussion of this paper at the 30th Annual TJIA Conference, regarding this paper's contribution, framing, and empirical execution. 
How to communicate cyber-risk? An examination of behavioral recommendations in cybersecurity crises. This study intended to incorporate the Cognitive Appraisal Theory with the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) by demonstrating that the appraisal process and emotional arousals are an essential part of people’s risk message processing. A 2 (behavioral recommendations: present vs. not present) × 2 (threat: high vs. low) × 2 (message types) between-subject experiment design was used to investigate the effects of the intersection between organizational risk communication strategies on publics’ negative emotions (i.e. fear and anxiety) and behavioral intentions in a cybersecurity crisis (data breach) context. Results confirmed the prediction and indicated that negative emotions (i.e. fear and anxiety) mediated behavioral recommendation and threat’s influence on publics’ behavioral outcomes such as compliance intentions, information seeking intentions and prosocial behavioral intentions. The study has practical implications for public policy making regarding the communication of cybersecurity risk. behavioral recommendations. cognitive appraisal theory.

Efficiently Encrypting Color Images with Few Details Based on RC6 and Different Operation Modes for Cybersecurity Applications. Recently, massive research works have been accomplished for augmenting privacy and security requirements for cybersecurity applications in wireless communication networks. This is attributed to the fact that conventional security processes are not appropriate for robust, efficient, and reliable multimedia streaming over unsecure media. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient color image cryptosystem based on RC6 with different modes of operation. The proposed cryptosystem is composed of two phases: Encryption and decryption. The encryption phase starts by decomposing the color plainimage with few details into its RGB components, which in turn, are segmented into 128-bit blocks. These blocks are then enciphered using RC6 with an appropriate mode of operation. After that, the corresponding enciphered blocks of RGB components are multiplexed for constructing the final cipherimage. This scenario is reversed in the decryption phase. The performance of the proposed cryptosystem is gauged via simulation using a set of encryption quality metrics. The simulation results reveal that the proposed cryptosystem with cipher block chaining (CBC), cipher feedback (CFB), and output feedback (OFB) modes can efficiently and effectively hide all information of the color images with few details even in the presence of some input blocks with similar data. On the other hand, the results show that the electronic codebook (ECB) mode is not effective at all in hiding all details of images. Finally, the obtained results ensure the applicability of the proposed cryptosystem and its efficiency in encrypting images in terms of security, encryption quality, and noise immunity. CBC. CFB.

School-based Cybersecurity Education Programme for Schoolchildren in South Africa! A Timely Call from Bloemfontein. The interconnection of many countries of the world today is hugely tied to the overwhelming improvements in the Internet. However, the improved Internet connectivity is not without diverse security risks such as bullying, scamming, hate speech, and identity theft especially for minors. It is unfortunate that the security risks attached to the use of the Internet are often ignored in the rush to log online by schoolchildren in South Africa. The cyber insecurities in South Africa became more precarious as schools do not teach cybersecurity as a subject in South Africa at present. Consequently, it behooves the researcher to unveil how the agents of education in South Africa learning ecologies can use the school-based cyber security education programme to protect schoolchildren against cyber scammers, and propose a blue-print on developing a school-based cybersecurity education programme for South African schoolchildren. In this paper, the space transition theory is used to explain the causation of insecurities confronting cyber savvy schoolchildren in South Africa. This paper methodically explicated related scientific papers that were published from 2005 to 2019 on cybercrimes, cybersecurity, and school-based participatory research. The community-driven model developed by Lavery et al. (2005) was used to design the school-based cybersecurity educational programme. This paper exhaustively explained the operations of the school-based cybersecurity educational programme and illustrated how teachers can use the informal cybersecurity educational programme to teach cybersecurity in South African schools.

Analyzing Students' Self-Perception of Success and Learning Effectiveness Using Gamification in an Online Cybersecurity Course. This paper analyzes students' self-perception of success and learning effectiveness after using non-compulsory gamification in an online Cybcourse. For this purpose, we designed a cybersecurity game based on cognitive constructivism learning theory. We built the game scenes using metaphors to present the main Cybersecurity contents to the students. We delivered the game in a regular course with two objectives: first, to find the primary design factors that affect students' self-perception of success. We propose a structural equation model to find out the elements with the most significant impact on the students' self-perception of success. The results show that the realistic game design and the contextualization of the game do have a notable influence. They are both examples of best practices in game design. second, to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the game. The results suggest a high correlation between playing the game and succeeding in the course. Moreover, chronological analysis of the performance reveals that the intention to play the game could be a simple dropout predictor. Thus, introducing the game in the educational curricula improves student engagement and consolidates their knowledge on cybersecurity.

A basic principle of physical security and its link to cybersecurity. The need for security is human nature and instinct It is about our survival and security. Humans have practiced it as a natural reaction to our surroundings. Historically, physical security has existed in the earh'est known forms of prehistoric civilizations. Many traditional principles and practices are still used and valid. What has changed is technology. Technology can be apph'ed as a powerful tool in well-conceived physical security programs as well as the cybersecurity Geld. Fundamental security concepts and their practical measures are as old as human beings' nature for survival and protection, as well as new technologies that are improving these basic concepts and apph'cations. The world of computers and information are constantly changing. Change exposes vulnerabilities. Security and IT professionals are facing challenges and problems targeting cyberspace and organization's information by gaining unauthorized access to breach security lines. Both traditional security professionals and technology-oriented IT and cybersecurity professionals must work together to protect the organizations and the individuals they serve by utilizing and applying the same principles of layered security protection lines in both physical and cyber worlds.

Defining Social Engineering in Cybersecurity. Social engineering has posed a serious security threat to infrastructure, user, data and operations of cyberspace. Nevertheless, there are many conceptual deficiencies (such as inconsistent conceptual intensions, a vague conceptual boundary, confusing instances, overgeneralization and abuse) of the term making serious negative impacts on the understanding, analysis and defense of social engineering attacks. In this paper, an in-depth literature survey is conducted, the original meaning of social engineering in cybersecurity is traced, the conceptual evolution and technical development are analysed systematically, and the conceptual problems are discussed. Based on above work, this paper attempts to address these conceptual deficiencies by proposing a more compatible and precise definition of social engineering in cybersecurity (SEiCS). This definition eliminates the conceptual inconsistencies, covers the mainstream conceptual connotations, clarifies the conceptual boundary, mitigates the overgeneralization and abuse, etc. Five analysis tables (i.e., the comparative analysis of the SEiCS definition vs. mainstream conceptual intensions in the conceptual evolution, the comparative analysis of the SEiCS definition vs. typical definitions in the literature, the analysis of confusing 'social engineering cases', the analysis of popular social engineering attack scenarios, and the analysis of social-engineering-based attacks) are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed definition. attack. conceptual evolution and analysis. cyberspace.

Solutions for mitigating cybersecurity risks caused by legacy software in medical devices: A scoping review. Cyberattacks against healthcare institutions threaten patient care. The risk of being targeted by a damaging attack is increased when medical devices are used which rely on unmaintained legacy software that cannot be replaced and may have publicly known vulnerabilities. This review aims to provide insight into solutions presented in the literature that mitigate risks caused by legacy software on medical devices. We performed a scoping review by categorising and analysing the contributions of a selection of articles, taken from a literature set discovered through bidirectional citation searching. We found 18 solutions, each fitting at least one of the categories of intrusion detection and prevention, communication tunnelling or hardware protections. Approaches taken include proxying Bluetooth communication through smartphones, behaviour-specification based anomaly detection and authenticating signals based on physical characteristics. These solutions are applicable to various use-cases, ranging from securing pacemakers to medical sensor networks. Most of the solutions are based on intrusion detection and on tunnelling insecure wireless communications. These technologies have distinct application areas, and the decision which one is most appropriate will depend on the type of medical device. Healthcare. legacy software. medical devices. security. 
Information technology governance and cybersecurity at the board level. Security breaches are very costly in the USA, followed very closely by the Middle East. Shareholders and investors demand that their firms mitigate all kinds of risks, and it is the responsibility of the BOD to gain and maintain their confidence. In view of this scenario, MENA companies need to protect their data, while the BODs need to embed a culture of cybersecurity in the firm. The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between information technology governance (ITG) and the level of cybersecurity by MENA listed firms. The study used a checklist to collect data from a sample of 94 firms listed in the financial stock markets of the MENA countries for the year ended 2018. The study found that there is a significant and direct relationship between ITG and the level of a firm's cybersecurity. This indicates the importance of appointing board members with IT knowledge and experience. This leads to better decisions taken by the BODs when faced with cyber-threats and challenges. In addition, IT expertise on the BODs can be important to understand what the Heads of IT are doing on the inside and, thus being knowledgeable enough to challenge their actions. Copyright .

Cyber security strategies of Latin America countries [Estrategias de seguridad cibernética en los países de América Latina]. Thanks to the active development of information technology and the creation of a global information space, the basis of which is the Internet, new opportunities have been opened to the world. However, this has led to the emergence of new types of dangers-cybercrime, cyber attacks and cyber warfare. The need to counter them, as well as the need to create a secure information environment, has led states to create their own national cybersecurity systems, as well as to adopt national strategies in this area. In most countries of Latin America, there is still no mechanism for ensuring information security, which makes them vulnerable to information attacks. The article gives an overview of national cybersecurity strategies that have been approved in only seven countries of region.

It has been established that the development of information and telecommunication technologies testifies to the progress of society but also determines the security risks of their use. In particular, this refers to a cyberattack and other cyberthreats. It has been determined that cybersecurity should be understood as the protection of the vital interests of a person and citizen, society and the state when using cyberspace. An important role in ensuring such a security is played by the cyberthreat protection mechanism, which provides for the development and adoption of a cybersecurity strategy, the creation of a national cybersecurity system, strengthening of the security and defense sector's capabilities to effectively combat military cyberthreats, cyberterrorism, and ensuring cyberprotection of state electronic information resources and information infrastructure. The existence of the Cybersecurity Strategy of Ukraine and other acts as the legal basis for countering cyberthreats has been noted. In turn, the national cybersecurity system provides for the activities of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police of Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies. In turn, in France, Finland, Germany, the central place in the cybersecurity system belongs to the National Cybersecurity Agency, the National Cybersecurity Center, and the Cyberdefense Center, respectively. Despite Ukraine's significant steps towards increasing cybersecurity in the state, there is no public-private cooperation in this area. Due to this, authorized entities should establish cooperation with the non-state sector and establish effective institutional and legal instruments for such cooperation. At the same time, the issue of public-private cooperation in the field of cybersecurity is relevant for all states of the world in view of the global nature of existing cyberthreats. Cyberattack.

Intrusion detection in cyber security: Role of machine learning and data mining in cyber security. In recent years, cyber security has been received interest from several research communities with respect to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Cyber security is a fast-growing field demanding a great deal of attention because of remarkable progresses in social networks, cloud and web technologies, online banking, mobile environment, smart grid, etc. An IDS is a software that monitors a single or a network of computers from malicious activities (attacks). Detecting an intrusion or prevention (due to increase the usage of internet), is becoming a critical issue. In past, several techniques have been proposed to overcome or detect intrusion in a network. But most of the techniques (used now days in detecting IDS) are not able to overcome this problem (in efficient manner).Together this, Machine Learning (ML) also has been adopted in various applications (due to providing good accuracy results (in respective domain)). Hence, this work discusses How machine learning anddata mining can be used to detect IDS in a network in near future.ML use efficient methods like classification, regression, etc., with efficient results like high detection rates, lower false alarm rates and less communication costs. This work also provides a detail comparison with metrics in table 1-3 (with their performance/ algorithms/ dataset or metrics used). Cyber Security. Data Mining. Intrusion Detection System.

Cyber-security of chemical industry in the Czech Republic [Kybernetická bezpečnost chemického průmyslu v České republice]. The paper deals with the legislative requirements and specifications of cybersecurity in the chemical industry, including the criteria for designating basic service opera-tors under the Cyber Security Act. It also addresses the issue of the number of basic services designated operators by the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA). By February 15, 2019, NCISA has not designat-ed a single basic service operator or the information sys-tem of the basic service operator. It can be expected that the NCISA will determine the entities on an ongoing basis in the coming years, which will require the obligated enti-ties to comply with legal requirements. At the end of the paper, proposals for measures to increase the cybersecurity of chemical plants by dissemination of best practices and educational activities at the national level are set.

Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition Using Multi-Modal Ensemble Learning. Cybersecurity named entity recognition is an important part of threat information extraction from large-scale unstructured text collection in many cybersecurity applications. Most existing security entity recognition studies and systems use regular matching strategy or machine learning algorithms. Due to the peculiarity and complexity of security named entity, these models ignore the characteristic of security data and the correlation of entities. Therefore, through the in-depth study of security entity characteristic, we propose a novel security named entity recognition model based on regular expressions and known-entity dictionary as well as conditional random fields (CRF) combined with four feature templates. This model is named RDF-CRF. The rule-based expressions can match security entities with good accuracy in simpler situations, the known-entity dictionary can extract common and specific security entity, and the CRF-based extractor leverages the identified entities by rule-based and dictionary-based extractors to further improve the recognition performance. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, extensive experiments are performed on a security text dataset collected from public security webs. The experimental results show that can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods. conditional random fields.

RFPS: A Robust Feature Points Detection of Audio Watermarking for against Desynchronization Attacks in Cyber Security. Digital watermarking is an effective covert communication technique in the military field, which can solve the problems in traditional encryption. In general, the Spread Spectrum (SS) algorithm can well satisfy the requirements of concealment and anti-interference in the covert communication process. However, it has a natural defect in resisting desynchronization attacks. In this paper, we propose a Robust Feature Points Scheme (RFPS) against desynchronization attacks by calculating the maximum response value of the second-order derivative of the original audio signal. The maximum response value will be used as a feature point and the audio segments centering at the detected feature points are extracted for both watermark embedding and extraction process. This study mainly focuses on cropping attacks and pitch invariant Time-Scale Modification (TSM) attacks. The experimental results show that under non-uniform cropping attacks, the proposed method can extract the watermark information without any bit error rate. Even in the case of the pitch-invariant TSM attacks, the proposed scheme has great improvement compared with the existing works.

A projected dynamic system associated with a cybersecurity investment model with budget constraints and fixed demands. In this paper, we present a cybersecurity investment supply chain model with nonlinear budget constraints and fixed demands, which gives a generalized Nash equilibrium model. We define the related variational equilibrium and study the associated projected dynamic system (PDS), establishing the relationship between the solutions to the variational inequality and the stationary points of the PDS. Then, we propose a computational procedure to find such stationary points and, finally, some numerical examples illustrate the obtained results. Expected utility. Projected dynamic systems.

Responding to cybersecurity challenges: Securing vulnerable U.S. emergency alert systems. Emergency alert systems (EASs) in the United States (US) form part of the nation’s critical infrastructure. These systems rely on aging platforms and suffer from a fragmented interconnected network of partnerships. Some EASs have an easily identifiable vulnerability: one can access their management website via the Internet. Authorities must secure these systems quickly. Other concerns also exist, such as the lack of policies for reporting vulnerabilities. To begin to assess EASs in the US, we used Shodan to evaluate the availability of these websites in six southeastern states. We found 18 such websites that one could access via the Internet and that required only requiring user credentials to login into. Next, we searched for published policies on reporting vulnerabilities. we found no vulnerability-disclosure policies for any system we identified. To identify, prioritize, and address EAS vulnerabilities, we present a list of technical and management strategies to reduce cybersecurity threats. We recommend integrated policies and procedures at all levels of the public-private-government partnerships and system resilience as lines of defense against cybersecurity threats. By implementing these strategies, EASs in the US will be positioned to update critical infrastructure, notify groups of emergencies, and ensure the distribution of valid and reliable information to at-risk populations.

Additive Manufacturing Cyber-Physical System: Supply Chain Cybersecurity and Risks. Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain (digital thread) with the physical supply chain and their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further, we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.

Examining the relationship between cybersecurity and scaling value for new companies. We explore the cybersecurity-scaling relationship in the context of scaling new company value rapidly. The relationship between the management of what a new company does to protect against the malicious or unauthorized use of electronic data, and the management of what a new company does to scale company value rapidly is important, but not well understood. We use a topic modelling technique to identify the eight topics that best describe a corpus comprised of 137 assertions about what new companies do to scale company value rapidly, manually examine the stability of the topics extracted from the dataset, and describe the relationship between 17 assertions about how to manage cybersecurity in new companies, and the six topics found to be stable. The six stable topics are labelled Fundraise, Enable, Position, Communicate, Innovate, and Complement. We find that of the 17 cybersecurity assertions, seven are related to Position, two to Innovate, one to Fundraise and, one to Complement. Six cybersecurity assertions were not found to be strongly related to any of the eight topics. This paper contributes to our understanding of cybersecurity in the context of a new company that scales its value rapidly, an application of topic modelling to perform small-scale data analysis, and a manual approach to examine the stability of the topics extracted by the topic modelling technique. We expect this paper to be relevant to new companies' top management teams, members of the networks upon which new companies depend for to scale company value, accelerators and incubators, as well as academics teaching or carrying out research in entrepreneurship.

Analysis of job stress's impact on job performance and turnover of cybersecurity professionals. This study examines the causal relationships of how cybersecurity professional's work attitudes, such as job stress and job satisfaction, affect their outcomes, such as job performance and turnover intention, key positive and negative indicators for organizational effectiveness. 157 cybersecurity professionals from diverse industries, especially from the IT industry, participated in responding to the survey questionnaire. Missing values in 7 responses made excluded from the analysis. Results of structural equation modeling show that job stress has a direct positive effect on turnover intention. Job satisfaction has direct positive and negative effects on job performance and turnover intention respectively. Job satisfaction acts as a mediating variable between job stress and turnover intention. Senior management must understand and properly manage cybersecurity professional's job stress, one of the key precursors to turnover intention, and make efforts to raise job satisfaction for higher job performance and lower turnover intention.

Investigation of Chaotic Image Encryption in Spatial and FrFT Domains for Cybersecurity Applications. The need for cybersecurity increases to protect the exchange of information for improving the data privacy. This paper presents an investigation of the encryption efficiency of the chaotic-based image block ciphering in the spatial and Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) domains. The main aim of this investigation is to examine the efficiency of different chaotic maps, while considering the parameters of the FrFT as additional keys for encryption and achieving reliable cybersecurity for robust image communication. In this paper, Cat, Baker, and Logistic map confusion approaches are applied in the spatial and FrFT domains to study and analyze the cybersecurity and ciphering efficiency of chaos-based image cryptosystems. The confusion features of the chaotic maps in spatial and FrFT domains are investigated using information entropy, differential analysis, histograms, visual observation, attack analysis, impact of noise, and encryption quality tests. Simulation results prove that the chaotic-based image encryption in the FrFT domain increases the efficiency of the confusion process and achieves a high nonlinear relation between the plainimage and the cipherimage in a symmetric ciphering approach. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the Cat-FrFT scheme is more susceptible to channel noise attacks than the Baker-FrFT and the Logistic-FrFT schemes. Hence, they can be implemented efficiently in the scenarios of noisy channels due to their high robustness to channel noise. Arnold Cat map. chaotic Baker map. confusion. FrFT. image encryption.

'Global cybersecurity legislation?' - factors, perspective and implications. As at the time of this research, no globally adopted and unified legislation for cybersecurity exists that is currently operational, despite rife global clamours for such a legislative framework. This research paper synthesizes and reviews some of the key imposing factors, putting in perspective the surrounding realities that impede the successful actualisation of such a framework, using the qualitative-exploratory research methodology. Also, presenting the implications of these factors and associated realities for cyber peacekeeping and the struggle for a utopian global information society, and then proposing recommendations pertaining the feasibility and operability of a global cybersecurity legal framework.

Harnessing artificial intelligence capabilities to improve cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a fast-evolving discipline that is always in the news over the last decade, as the number of threats rises and cybercriminals constantly endeavor to stay a step ahead of law enforcement. Over the years, although the original motives for carrying out cyberattacks largely remain unchanged, cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated with their techniques. Traditional cybersecurity solutions are becoming inadequate at detecting and mitigating emerging cyberattacks. Advances in cryptographic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (in particular, machine learning and deep learning) show promise in enabling cybersecurity experts to counter the ever-evolving threat posed by adversaries. Here, we explore AI's potential in improving cybersecurity solutions, by identifying both its strengths and weaknesses. We also discuss future research opportunities associated with the development of AI techniques in the cybersecurity field across a range of application domains.

A survey on machine learning for cyber security. Cyber crime is proliferating everywhere exploiting every kind of vulnerability to computing environment. Ethical Hackers pay more attention towards assessing vulnerabilities and recommending mitigation methodologies. The development of effective techniques has been an urgent demand in the field of the cybersecurity community. Machine Learning for cybersecurity has become an issue of great importance recently due to th e effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning in cybersecurity issues. Machine learning techniques have been applied for major challenges in cybersecurity issues like intrusion detection, malware classification and detection, spam detection and phishing detection. Although machin e learning cannot automate a complete cybersecurity system, it helps to identify cyber-security threats more efficiently than other software-oriented methodologies, and thus reduces the burden on security analysts. Ever evolving nature of cyber threats throws challenges continuously on the researchers to explore with the ideal combination of deep expertise in cybersecurity and in data science. In this paper, we present the current state of art machine learning applications and their potential for cybersecurity. An analysis of machine learning algorithms for most common types of cybersecurity threats is presented. Cybersecurity. Deep learning. Machine learning. Malware detection. 
Cybersecurity attacks on wireless sensor networks in smart cities: An exposition. The smart city concept is a link between digital world and the physical world. The smart city is designed and constructed by using advanced techniques which consist of sensors, electronics and networks. However, automatic information flow and connection between IoT devices creates new security risks. If data can be accessed remotely, it means that a cybercriminal could also access it. Moreover, connectivity is the essence of IoT. If multiple devices are connected to the same network, it means that cybercriminals have multiple access points. Understanding how wireless sensor technology works is crucial before deploying IoT applications. In this article, we explore the understanding through: (1) vulnerabilities on wireless sensors and techniques to avoid them, (2) emerging wireless standards for sensors, and (3) what role these standards will play in the future.

Cybersecurity: Nurses on the Front Line of Prevention and Education. Cybercrime has become an increasing concern for consumers in the United States and internationally. In recent years, cybercrimes in the healthcare industry have drastically increased in type, impact, and frequency. These attacks have negatively impacted patient privacy, the ability of providers to deliver care, and the security of healthcare organizations. Nurses are uniquely positioned to help protect against and report cybercrimes because they are one of the largest employed populations in the healthcare industry and they are on the front line of patient care and healthcare technology use. This article discusses the main concerns of cybersecurity in healthcare, the nurse's role in preventing and managing cyber security, and recommendations for nurses, educators, and regulators.

Evaluation of Cybersecurity Data Set Characteristics for Their Applicability to Neural Networks Algorithms Detecting Cybersecurity Anomalies. Artificial intelligence algorithms have a leading role in the field of cybersecurity and attack detection, being able to present better results in some scenarios than classic intrusion detection systems such as Snort or Suricata. In this sense, this research focuses on the evaluation of characteristics for different well-established Machine Leaning algorithms commonly applied to IDS scenarios. To do this, a categorization for cybersecurity data sets that groups its records into several groups is first considered. Making use of this division, this work seeks to determine which neural network model (multilayer or recurrent), activation function, and learning algorithm yield higher accuracy values, depending on the group of data. Finally, the results are used to determine which group of data from a cybersecurity data set are more relevant and representative for the intrusion detection, and the most suitable configuration of Machine Learning algorithm to decrease the computational load of the system.

The people problem: how cyber security's weakest link can become a formidable asset. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) finally began to bare its teeth last summer, with British Airways and the Marriott hotel chain both being hit with massive fines of £183m and £99.2m respectively for breaching the rules.1,2 Organisations saw that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) meant business when it came to applying its new powers, and this appears to have helped trigger a new wave of investment in cyber security. While the prospect of major fines has woken boardrooms up to the importance of cyber risk management, it has not necessarily led to money being spent in the right areas. The insider threat has increased as working practices have evolved and new technologies have been adopted. Collaboration platforms, cloud services, smart devices and mobile apps all represent varying forms of cyber risk. To tackle this effectively requires a mix of technical and process-driven measures, says Jon Fielding of Apricorn. 
Multicriteria Decision Framework for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment and Management. Risk assessors and managers face many difficult challenges related to novel cyber systems. Among these challenges are the constantly changing nature of cyber systems caused by technical advances, their distribution across the physical, information, and sociocognitive domains, and the complex network structures often including thousands of nodes. Here, we review probabilistic and risk-based decision-making techniques applied to cyber systems and conclude that existing approaches typically do not address all components of the risk assessment triplet (threat, vulnerability, consequence) and lack the ability to integrate across multiple domains of cyber systems to provide guidance for enhancing cybersecurity. We present a decision-analysis-based approach that quantifies threat, vulnerability, and consequences through a set of criteria designed to assess the overall utility of cybersecurity management alternatives. The proposed framework bridges the gap between risk assessment and risk management, allowing an analyst to ensure a structured and transparent process of selecting risk management alternatives. The use of this technique is illustrated for a hypothetical, but realistic, case study exemplifying the process of evaluating and ranking five cybersecurity enhancement strategies. The approach presented does not necessarily eliminate biases and subjectivity necessary for selecting countermeasures, but provides justifiable methods for selecting risk management actions consistent with stakeholder and decisionmaker values and technical data.

Study on cyber-security for IoT edge utilizing pattern match accelerator. A malware detection algorithm that can be embedded in IoT edge computing is proposed in this study and validated using an emulator. This algorithm, with a pattern match accelerator, reduces the computing cost while maintaining a relatively high detection accuracy. For autonomous driving, complicated IoT edge computing must have a huge amount of embedded program codes. In such a situation, the invasion of malware can lead to compromised cybersecurity. In this study, a pattern match accelerator is implemented for such issues, thereby offering IoT edge computing that detects malware automatically. Edge computing is designed to apply simply structural level analysis algorithms using HLAC mask pattern. We developed a pseudo-emulator system environment and conducted performance confirmation of the proposed technique using 641 chosen samples from six types of malware families. The algorithm’s efficiencies demonstrated an identification performance of approximately 80%. In comparison to characteristic extraction using AI, the computing cost was reduced and these processes enable edge computing with high cybersecurity features. Cyber-security.

How to build a vulnerability benchmark to overcome cyber security attacks. Cybercrimes are on a dramatic rise worldwide. The crime rate is growing day by day in every field or department which is directly or indirectly connected to the internet including Government, business or any individual. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the vulnerabilities in different software systems at the source code level by tracing their patch files. The authors have collected the source code of different types of vulnerabilities at a different level of granularities. They have proposed different ways to collect or trace the vulnerability code, which can be very helpful for security experts, organisations and software developers to maintain security measures. By following their proposed method, you can build your own vulnerability data-set and can detect vulnerabilities in any system by using suitable code clone detection technique. The study also includes a discussion of reasons for the rise in cybercrimes including zero-day exploits. A case study has been discussed with results and research questions to show the effectiveness of this study. This study concludes with the effective key findings of published and non-published vulnerabilities and the ways to prevent from different security attacks to overcome cybercrimes. 
A reliable next generation cyber security architecture for industrial internet of things environment. Architectural changes are happening in the modern industries due to the adaption and the deployment of „Internet of Things (IoT)‟ for monitoring and controlling various devices remotely from the external world. The most predominant place where the IoT technology makes the most sense is the industrial automation processes in smart industries (Industry 4.0). In this paper, a reliable „Next Generation Cyber Security Architecture (NCSA)‟ is presented for Industrial IoT (IIoT) environment that detects and thwarts cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. It helps to automate the processes of exchanging real-time critical information between devices without any human intervention. It proposes an analytical framework that can be used to protect entities and network traffics involved in the IIoT wireless communication. It incorporates an automated cyber-defense authentication mechanism that detects and prevents security attacks when a network session has been established. The defense mechanism accomplishes the required level of security protection in the network by generating an identity token which is cryptographically encrypted and verified by a virtual gateway system. The proposed NCSA improves security in the IIoT environment and reduces operational management cost. Copyright . Cyber security architecture. Cyber-defense authentication mechanism. Industrial IoT.

A framework for competence development and assessment in hybrid cybersecurity exercises. Rising numbers and sophistication of security threats in the digital domain cause an increase in the demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals. In response, cybersecurity exercises, and in particular—cyber defence exercises (CDX) are becoming ever more popular. They provide a training platform to simulate real-life situations. CDX are significant events involving months of preparation, and previous studies show a lack of objective evidence of their relevance regarding the learning impact. Skills of exercise participants are usually different and vary from tech-savvy to beginners. Also, trainees are diverse when considering their background, current work profile (position and institution), and experience. Assessment of their competencies is essential to ensure quality in training. The complexity and multi-dimensionality of the usual CDX make it challenging. Additionally, the costly event usually focuses on just a subset of participants, and non-technical members of an organisation are not included. The goal of our research is to provide a proper methodology to optimise the exercises so that every team and each participant, including a non-technical trainee, are adequately evaluated and trained using the allocated resources most effectively. This paper presents a framework to aid in the development and assessment of cybersecurity competences of all teams during hybrid CDX. The framework aims towards raised cybersecurity awareness—a state when every user of digital technologies understands the associated risks. The framework consists of a sequence of steps including stages of formative assessment, team construction, determination of objectives for different types of teams, and the exercise flow. It complements standard methodologies for cybersecurity training programs. The framework was developed based on data collected using questionnaires, interviews, and direct observation in a case study carried out during international cybersecurity exercises. The framework would help organise hybrid exercises for a diverse community of trainees, including non-technical members of an organisation. Competence assessment. Competence development framework.

It’s Like a Cyber-Security Blanket: The Utility of Remote Activity Monitoring in Family Dementia Care. Technologies have emerged that aim to help older persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) remain at home while also supporting their caregiving family members. However, the usefulness of these innovations, particularly in home-based care contexts, remains underexplored. The current study evaluated the acceptability and utility of an in-home remote activity monitoring (RAM) system for 30 family caregivers of persons with ADRD via quantitative survey data collected over a 6-month period and qualitative survey and interview data collected for up to 18 months. A parallel convergent mixed methods design was employed. The integrated qualitative and quantitative data suggested that RAM technology offered ongoing monitoring and provided caregivers with a sense of security. Considerable customization was needed so that RAM was most appropriate for persons with ADRD. The findings have important clinical implications when considering how RAM can supplement, or potentially substitute for, ADRD family care.

Development of cyber security and privacy by precision decentralized actionable threat and risk management for mobile communication using Internet of Things (IOT).In the recent past, with the tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communication the security and privacy are needed for the information transmitted from transmitter to receiver. IoT refers to connecting wireless sensor network, various mobile communication applications, machine, people living in different location and equipment collectively by utilizing local or broad are wireless communication and cloud communication, with the internet as the adhesive, during original path to construct a precision wireless sensor network. In this paper, a novel cyber security and privacy methodology is proposed based on precision decentralized actionable threat and risk management for mobile communication using IoT. The threat and risk can be managed by providing efficient and accurate action and the methodology is the decentralized amount the wireless sensor network to carry mobile communication precision. The huge- scale operation of the IoT want to face few problems, particularly in security and privacy problems for precision, linking between wireless sensor network, and mobile communication with IoT devices because of the truth that IoT has various individuality through conventional wireless communication networks, linked to its particular risk and threats. The security and privacy solutions for IoT should give IoT wireless nodes (users, servers, things and objects) with information validity, privacy, integrity and originality certification, and approval. The risk and threat management should be properly decentralized protection must be considered. cyber security and privacy. decentralized actionable threat and risk management.

Implementing cyber security policy for Big Data system.Industries realize the benefits of Big Data as information is crucial to their normal work, but new problems exist as a result of previous techniques. These issues are associated not only to the 3Vs of Deep Learning, but to control and confidentiality, as is the case regarding Information Technology. Protection becomes essential in Massive Datasets, but alas, privacy concerns happen as Big Data is not planned without good security. Even so, leading to the varied settings that a Big Data contains, this function is hard. It's really important and provides a central database.

It was hard to find the words : Using an Autoethnographic Diary Study to Understand the Difficulties of Smart Home Cyber Security Practices . This study considers how well an autoethnographic diary study helps as a method to explore why families might struggle in the application of strong and cohesive cyber security measures within the smart home. Combining two human-computer interaction (HCI) research methods - the relatively unstructured process of autoethnography and the more structured diary study - allowed the first author to reflect on the differences between researchers or experts, and everyday users. Having a physical set of structured diary prompts allowed for a period of  thinking as writing , enabling reflection upon how having expert knowledge may or may not translate into useful knowledge when dealing with everyday life. This is particularly beneficial in the context of home cyber security use, where first-person narratives have not made up part of the research corpus to date, despite a consistent recognition that users struggle to apply strong cyber security methods in personal contexts. The framing of the autoethnographic diary study contributes a very simple, but extremely powerful, tool for anyone with more knowledge than the average user of any technology, enabling the expert to reflect upon how they themselves have fared when using, understanding and discussing the technology in daily life. autoethnography. children. cyber security. diary study. families. home.

Integrated Approach to Cybersecurity of a Small-Sized Business System.Computer systems are used everywhere, it is impossible to find a company or a home without computer devices where data of commercial and private type are stored. This data should be protected, but not enough attention is paid to cybersecurity problems in small-sized computer systems, because of the lack of professionals and lack of funds. This paper goes into analysis of the most common computer threats and ways to protect computer systems and proposes an integrated approach to security system engineering in the view ofminimizing its costs.
Applying Blockchain to Vehicle Cybersecurity: Nuance to the Standard Application.Bitcoin and other digital currencies utilize blockchain. Blockchain, in summary, is a collection of blocks. Within each block is a collection of transactions. Each computer (node) has the same list of blocks and transactions, which they can see as the blocks are filled with the transactions. While this is the traditional application experienced, there are other applications relevant to cybersecurity. As part of the blockchain technology, the nodes are responsible for decision-making. The blockchain technology may be used for this function in these systems. In adjusting the data flow, this is an option to increase the cybersecurity for a complete system. This addition to the cybersecurity system provides a clear benefit.
Identifying Cybersecurity Focus Areas in Connected Cars Based on WP.29 UN-R155 Attack Vectors and beyond. The UN working group WP.29 published UN Regulation No. 155, the  Uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regards to cyber security and cyber security management systems, which became a binding resolution on January 22nd, 2021 with expectations that at least 54 countries will mandate it starting July 2022. The regulation lists 69 attack vectors directly affecting vehicle cyber security. Car manufacturers, suppliers, government organizations, etc. all stakeholder's cooperation and efforts are necessary for the successful implementation of the published regulation. The first course of action is to sort these attack vectors according to their expected threat severity levels, so stakeholders can determine the order in which to tackle mitigating said threats. In this paper, using the industry standard DREAD threat modelling, we calculated the severity levels of the attack vectors listed in the WP.29 UN-R155 cyber security regulation. Additionally, we go beyond the attack vectors listed in UN-R155 - using our own analysis, experience and insights, we explored other attack vectors that will also affect vehicle cybersecurity.
Requirements for the Automated Generation of Attack Trees to Support Automotive Cybersecurity Assurance.As the need for automotive assurance continues to grow, it becomes necessary to develop approaches which can provide assurance cases in a systematic and efficient manner. In the case of cybersecurity, this problem is exacerbated by the increasing complexity of vehicular onboard systems, their inherent obscurity due to their heterogenous architecture, emergent behaviors, and the disparate motivations and resources of potential threat agents. Furthermore, the advancement of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) may allow external attackers to leverage the naïve trust ECUs have for adjacent devices to compromise the safety and security of the vehicle. To that end, there is an increased interest in automatically producing threat models such as attack trees, which usually rely on intensive expert driven construction or rudimentary formally defined processes, to identify potential threats to a vehicle. Therefore, this paper will explore the ways in which such an automated scheme could be applied for a practicable identification and analysis of potential attack paths. Although ISO/SAE 21434 recommends the development of an assurance case for cybersecurity, the precise nature of a cybersecurity case is not explicitly defined within the standard. Therefore, this paper also explores the combination of threat modelling techniques with assurance case techniques adapted from accepted practice in vehicle safety for functional safety (per ISO 26262) while taking into consideration the relevant standards.
Strategy to Adopt ISO/SAE 21434 Cyber Security Assurance Level in the Organization.The recent standard, ISO/SAE 21434, is introduced to address the cybersecurity requirements for the development of electrical and electronic components in the road vehicles. This standard has introduced a new classification scheme, cybersecurity assurance level (CAL), that helps in validating the process rigor needed for mitigating different threat scenarios. CAL values can range from 1(Least stringent process rigor) to 4 (most stringent process rigor). CAL provides assurance that the assets of an item or component are adequately protected against the relevant threat scenarios by defining the scope of various processes at different phases of the Secure Development Life Cycle (SDL). CAL values can be determined at the earlier stages of the SDLC (cybersecurity concept phase) through the knowledge of attack vectors and attack severity specific to a system. The CAL value can be used as a reference to define the scope of rigor in the design, development, and verification phase of the SDLC. This paper aims to define a process to determine CAL based on the existing concepts of ISO/SAE21434 guidelines. The study adopts an RVC (Rear-View Camera) system and performs a threat modeling to describe the details of the proposed process and helps cybersecurity experts, organizations to implement a structured process of CAL in their existing cybersecurity management system.
Removing the Veil: Shining Light on the Lack of Inclusivity in Cybersecurity Education for Students with Disabilities.There are currently over one billion people living with some form of disability worldwide. The continuous increase in new technologies in today's society comes with an increased risk in security. A fundamental knowledge of cybersecurity should be a basic right available to all users of technology. A review of literature in the fields of cybersecurity, STEM, and computer science (CS) has revealed existent gaps regarding educational methods for teaching cybersecurity to students with disabilities (SWD's). To date, SWD's are largely left without equitable access to cybersecurity education. Our goal is to identify current educational methods being used to teach SWD's concepts of cybersecurity, evaluate these methods, and classify the observed trends. cybersecurity. disabilities. education. learning methods 
Authentic Learning of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity with Portable Hands-on Labware.New cyberattacks grow in an exponential rate. However, the state-of-the-art in cyber defense efforts cannot keep pace with the sophisticated cybersecurity threats and attacks. The industry relies excessively on anti-virus software which is effective for known malware signatures, but not sustainable for the massive amount of malware samples released daily, and its inefficiency in handling cyberattacks such as zero-day or polymorphic/metamorphic malware. Machine learning (ML) has been extensively studied with a good performance in identifying and extracting knowledge from a big dataset. This can be an alternative to the signature-based approach. Currently, many schools offer courses on topics in ML and cybersecurity (MLC), individually. It is believed that cybersecurity professionals require a deep understanding on ML in order to cope with the growing cyberattacks. Research has shown that authentic learning will create an engaging and motivating learning environment in learning emerging technologies. We propose to develop cyber workforce using authentic learning on machine learning in cybersecurity through a set of real-world cybersecurity learning modules, including a Pre/Lab/Post model focusing on real-world problem solving skills. Our goal is to integrate developed resources into existing curriculum, disseminate the resources through webinars and faculty workshops, and assess the effectiveness of authentic learning of MLC for fostering cybersecurity workforce. computer science education. cyberattack. cybersecurity. machine learning 
Cybersecurity Shuffle: Using Card Magic to Introduce Cybersecurity Concepts.One of the main challenges in designing lessons for an introductory information security class is how to present new technical concepts in a manner comprehensible to students with widely different backgrounds. A non-traditional approach can help students engage with the material and master these unfamiliar ideas. We have devised a series of lessons that teach important information security topics, such as social engineering, side-channel attacks, and attacks on randomness using card magic. Each lesson centers around a card trick that allows the instructor to simulate the described attack in such a way that prior technical background is not required. In this work, we describe our experience using these lessons in teaching cybersecurity topics to high school students with limited computer science education. Students were assessed before and after the demonstration to gauge their mastery of the material, and their opinions on each lesson. Students indicated they enjoyed the lesson and their pre- and post-test scores improved by between 15% and 30%. card magic. cybersecurity. education. scaffolding 
Reflections of Cybersecurity Workshop for K-12 Teachers and High School Students.In this paper, we describe efforts to promote a robust cyber security workforce through a series of online workshops for K-12 teachers and grades 7-12 students.

HELO DarkSide: Breaking Free from Katas and Embracing the Adversarial Mindset in Cybersecurity Education.The pedagogy of cybersecurity education presents an exciting challenge. Although cyber-warfare has existed for nearly four decades, we fail to adequately model the chaos of offensive cyber attacks in the classroom. Instead, coursework focuses on studying choreographed cyber-attack patterns. In this paper, we present an undergraduate cybersecurity course design that balances theoretical learning with an emphasis on exploring offensive tactics, techniques, and procedures. Labs consist of writing payloads and channels to evade detection, cobbling together operating system internals to achieve attack functionality, and developing survivable post-exploitation tools. In the exams, students develop malware capable of avoiding static and dynamic analysis and identify the strategic and tactical flaws that lead to the discovery of highly successful attack campaigns. We believe that sharing this experience will prove valuable for instructors who wish to explore offensive cyber tactics in the classroom. adversary mindset. cybersecurity education. malicious software 
Evaluating Two Approaches to Assessing Student Progress in Cybersecurity Exercises.Cybersecurity students need to develop practical skills such as using command-line tools. Hands-on exercises are the most direct way to assess these skills, but assessing students' mastery is a challenging task for instructors. We aim to alleviate this issue by modeling and visualizing student progress automatically throughout the exercise. The progress is summarized by graph models based on the shell commands students typed to achieve discrete tasks within the exercise. We implemented two types of models and compared them using data from 46 students at two universities. To evaluate our models, we surveyed 22 experienced computing instructors and qualitatively analyzed their responses. The majority of instructors interpreted the graph models effectively and identified strengths, weaknesses, and assessment use cases for each model. Based on the evaluation, we provide recommendations to instructors and explain how our graph models innovate teaching and promote further research. The impact of this paper is threefold. First, it demonstrates how multiple institutions can collaborate to share approaches to modeling student progress in hands-on exercises. Second, our modeling techniques generalize to data from different environments to support student assessment, even outside the cybersecurity domain. Third, we share the acquired data and open-source software so that others can use the models in their classes or research. assessment. command-line history. cybersecurity education. educational data mining. learning analytics. modeling 
Study Cybersecurity of Cyber Physical System in the Virtual Environment: A Survey and New Direction.The Industry 4.0 is defined as connecting the physical system to the cyber world with the help of transformative technologies. As a result, the number of cyber-attacks have grown exponentially. Cybersecurity has been identified as one of main challenges in applying the transformative technologies of Industry 4.0. An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research. For this reason, a variety of software tools and virtualization methods have been used to create virtual or hybrid systems for researchers. This paper study and review existing cybersecurity research on CPS in the virtual environment. Then authors point out four challenges in the state-of-the-art research based on the findings and discussion.

Cybersecurity and Interoperability of Aviation Safety Service Ecosystem.As the largest high speed mobile network system, the aviation safety service integrated network provides air-to-ground communication to various operators, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and airlines across multiple continents. Maintaining such a large network and mobile nodes comes with challenges. Seamless interoperability underpinned by cybersecurity is essential to successful safety service communication. By ensuring that technologies work together across platforms and geographic locations, we better protect the data that flows throughout our aviation systems. And when data is secure, we're able to confidently extend secure communication to reach aircraft, ANSPs, content providers, airline operation centers, and many more no matter where they receive and send messages across multiple endpoints within an aviation ecosystem across the globe. To provide aviation partners with cutting-edge equipment and to ensure that connected devices and systems meet or surpass security standards, the aviation community needs to be committed to ensuring technologies meet needed security specifications including security standards, the Risk Management Framework (RMF), and compliance to the contemporary security protocols and processes. By performing to these specifications, the aviation community can better enable the system-wide availability and cybersecurity of aviation data, thereby facilitating more timely and effective secure communication. This will require an extensive set of external compliance certifications, attestations to objective evidence of compliance to security regulations (examples include ISO 13485, ISO 14971, ISO 27001/18, SOC2) and product cybersecurity testing certification. This also requires combined cybersecurity testing elements of the established standard for software cybersecurity for network-connectable products, as well as security principles from international standards. This paper discusses the critical components of seamless interoperability underpinned by cybersecurity and related issues for secure data exchanges that ensures the continuum of Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) based safety service communication networks to the aviation safety service ecosystem.

A cybersecurity competition to support the autonomous, collaborative, and personalized learning in computer engineering.Cybersecurity is one of the most promising areas for future graduated students to develop their work life. However, the weight of cybersecurity is still low in most computer engineering programs, even though computer engineers are the most suitable professionals for cybersecurity activities. We claim the implementation of cybersecurity competitions, where students participate in teams between four and six people, improving the acquisition of cybersecurity competencies through the promotion of the autonomous, collaborative, and personalized learning. In order to validate the hypothesis, an experience was conducted during the second term of 2020/2021 course in Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Experience was conducted in the computer engineering degree, in the context of the subject 'Cybersecurity in Systems and Networks'. Two groups were defined: the control group following a traditional learning methodology, and a pilot group where learning was based on a cybersecurity competition, including short questionnaires, laboratory practices and puzzles. The results obtained validate the hypothesis and answer all research questions in a positive way. All learning indicators improve when students work on cybersecurity competencies through an educational competition. cybersecurity. educational competitions. Personalized learning

Critical Infrastructure Asset Discovery and Monitoring for Cyber Security.With ever growing cyber threats on critical infrastructures, need of deploying the security measures to protect these should be of utmost priority. However, without knowing about the assets in the network and what needs to be secured, all the threat modeling activities, strategies or mitigation/remediation activities will be incomplete or ineffective. Hence the critical infrastructure asset discovery and monitoring is a vital part for providing security. But unlike IT networks where asset discovery is automated, critical infrastructures often perform asset discovery and management manually which leads to incomplete and inefficient asset tracking and management over time and makes it ineffective in quick identification and response to potential threats. An automated approach for asset discovery and management is significant to secure critical infrastructures from cyber security incidents and other threats. This paper proposes an automation methodology for asset discovery, managing and monitoring. The solution is compliant to several NERC-CIP requirements and NCIIPC guidelines. It involves identification and real time monitoring of the critical assets connected to the network, baseline network behavior, maintain repository of asset details, compliance check adhering to policies and generates real time network map for visualization in the Purdue model for the better management of the assets. And it also generates incidents compatible with third party SOC/ SIEMs. The solution helps to reduce the risk of cyber security incidents in critical infrastructures.

COMMUNICATING CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY DESIGN ATTRIBUTES THROUGH PRIVACY LABELING OF CONSUMER ELECTRONIC MEDICAL DEVICES.The emergence of electronic medical devices has facilitated the integration of cybersecurity and privacy practices into the design of medical devices. An essential part of device design is the communication of the device principles to the consumers and providers that will utilize the device. The purpose of this research was to analyze the importance of health information privacy, propose a medical device privacy label and standards that can help fill these gaps for consumers, and evaluate the regulatory framework for which this proposal can be implemented. Privacy, both physical and informational, is a key pillar of American healthcare especially in our connected worlds. The threat to privacy from criminal actors and the impact that those actions of violating privacy can have on an individual's health are serious. Evaluating previous privacy labels, which lacked in applicability to the healthcare field, this research proposes a unique, standardized consumer privacy label for the FDA to implement, mirroring the design and success of the FDA nutrition label in educating consumers in healthy decision making.

Cyber Security Challenges in Distributed Energy Resources for Smart Cities.With the proliferation of data in Internet-related applications, incidences of cyber security have increased manyfold. Energy management, which is one of the smart city layers, has also been experiencing cyberattacks. Furthermore, the Distributed Energy Resources (DER), which depend on different controllers to provide energy to the main physical smart grid of a smart city, is prone to cyberattacks. The increased cyber-attacks on DER systems are mainly because of its dependency on digital communication and controls as there is an increase in the number of devices owned and controlled by consumers and third parties. This paper analyzes the major cyber security and privacy challenges that might inflict, damage or compromise the DER and related controllers in smart cities. These challenges highlight that the security and privacy on the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, and smart grid, which are the building blocks of a smart city, must be addressed in the DER sector. It is observed that the security and privacy challenges in smart cities can be solved through the distributed framework, by identifying and classifying stakeholders, using appropriate model, and by incorporating fault-tolerance techniques. cyber security. cyberattacks. distributed energy resources. energy management systems. smart cities 
The need for a financial sector legal standard to support the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity of 2014, followed by an updated version in 2017. The Framework, which was developed as a joint effort between the U.S. Federal Government and the private sector, serves only as a guideline and is not mandated by any legal authority. Currently, adoption of the Framework is voluntary. The Financial Sector, one of sixteen Department of Homeland Security critical infrastructure sectors, should be incentivized to adopt the framework, based on inconsistency and accountability of best practices implementation across the sector. Global cyber attack opportunists used the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities and gaps in the U.S. Financial Sector. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides guidelines for strengthening cybersecurity and identifies areas of potential cyber attack impacts. This paper is a summary of the author's published 2021 doctoral dissertation, which includes research and analysis of reported Financial Sector risks, failures and impacts due to weak or lack of cybersecurity controls. The study also provides analysis of success stories of Financial Sector and other entities which have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Dr. Goodwin is a Senior Member of IEEE.

Analysis of Network Technologies and Cyber security Assessment for Enhancing Machine Learning, Grid Computing and Cyber-Physical Connectivity Internetwork Effectiveness. The fast improvement of the Internet has incredibly worked with individuals spreading information worldwide, prompting the Internet turning into a pivotal apparatus in many fields like science, trade, schooling, etc. With the Internet common in such countless parts of day to day existence, network security has become basic and requests consistent consideration. For this situation, an IDS's motivation is to recognize between real organization associations and possibly hurtful ones. The recommended method in this examination centers around an interruption identification and avoidance system that comprises of Cloudlet Controller (CC), Trust Authority (TA), and Virtual Machine Manager to recognize questionable practices in a cloud climate. Cloud clients are migrated to different regions in the climate, as indicated by our proposed approach. Whenever information bundles from different clients are gathered, network traffic happens. To resolve this issue, we assembled the Cloudlet Controller, which gets bundles from different clients through switch. CC gets parcels until they arrive at their edge level. if the cloudlet is over-burden, the bundles are shipped off inactive cloudlets. In this philosophy, network traffic is decreased, and it is significantly helpful in identifying interruptions in a straightforward way. In this review, a cross breed arrangement based interruption location and counteraction framework on the cloud is worked to distinguish gatecrasher exercises in the framework. A cross breed characterization based interruption location framework is created with a few cloudlets, a cloudlet regulator, a confided in power, and a virtual machine supervisor to distinguish interloper assaults in the framework, as well as a deterrent instrument to safeguard bundles from gatecrashers.

The Empirical Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches for Enhancing the Cyber security for better Quality.In recent years, there have been significant advances in both technologies tactics so in area of cyber security, with (ML) machine learning at the forefront of the transformation. It is the ability to obtain security event characteristics or findings from cyber security information and then develop a matching information model that will allow a security system to become autonomous and smart. The widespread proliferation and the usage of Web and Smartphone applications has increased the size of cyber world as a consequence. When a computerized assault takes too long to complete, the internet becomes vulnerable. Security measures may be improved by recognizing and reacting to cyber-attacks, thanks to cyber security techniques. Security measures that were previously used aren't any longer appropriate because scammers have learned how to evade them. It is getting more difficult to detect formerly unknown and unpredictable security breaches, which are growing more widespread. Cyber security is becoming more dependent on machine learning (ML) techniques. Machine learning algorithms' dependability remains a major challenge, given its continual advancement. It is possible to find malicious hackers in internet that are ready to exploit ML defects that have been made public. A thorough review of machine learning techniques safeguarding cyberspace against attacks is provided in this paper, which presents a literature review on Cyber security using machine learning methods, such as vulnerability scanning, spam filtering, or threat detection on desktop networks as well as smart phone networks. Among other things, this paper provides brief descriptions of each machine-learning technique and security info, essential machine-learning technology, and evaluation parameters for a classification method.

MABAC Method for Assessment of Cyber Security Technologies Under Fermatean Fuzzy Sets.Cyber security is a basic need for every digital device such as computers, mobiles, networks, servers and electronic items. It protects digital devices from various malicious cyber-attacks or threats created over the Internet. In the digitized world, cyber security threats have been an emerging problem. In the current scenario the growth of digital devices is very high, and the risks of cyber security technologies (CST) are serious issues. These types of threats should be considered when choosing the best among cyber security technologies. For this purpose, we approach mathematically to determine the safest CST. In this paper, first we study CST and their risk factors. Then, Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) are used to develop Fermatean fuzzy multi attribute border approximation area comparison (FF-MABAC) method. This method handles more uncertain decision-making problems by computing distance between each alternative and bordered approximation area (BAA). At the end of the paper, an application has been given to CST and their computing approaches are demonstrated numerically. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of results is conducted and direction for future research is provided. Cyber Security Technologies (CST). Fermatean fuzzy sets. Mabac model. MCDM. Risk assessment 
Cyber Security Challenges and Trends on Recent Technologies.Protecting data and information systems (such as networking, computing systems, and cloud services, as well as software) is the goal of cyber security. Protecting personal information and computer networks using tools like firewalls, virus protection, and other software is necessary, but it isn't enough. Information technology (IT) and Internet services (ISPs) must take cyber-security into account. In the internet world, we need to be aware of the many sorts of dangers that exist. It is crucial to the nation's security and stability well-being that cyber security and the protection of key information be strengthened. When we think of cyber security, we automatically conjure up images of the ever-increasing problem of online crime. There are a variety of steps being taken by governments and businesses to combat cyber-crime. The prevalence of smartphone and private computing device-based cybercrime underscores the need of keeping abreast of current worldwide developments in cybercrime.

Blockchain Enabled Cyber Security: A Comprehensive Survey.This paper identifies research paths for blockchain in cyber security that need further research: Internet of Things (IoT) security has indeed been promoted as a critical industrial necessity, even though almost all publications on blockchain cyber security in literature pointed out that the security of IoT systems can be revived if it is backed by blockchain. Yet, few things are now known and talked about the decision-making and practicality of adopting the technology, or how it may be used realistically to correct existing IoT security risks and threats, providing scope for imagination and the construction of future vectors in this particular area. As a result, future research must establish measurable recommendations and methods that can assist in filling the gaps in the existing literature. There is also the potential to develop solutions for IoT devices with limited resources (operating on the periphery of the network) that are based on blockchain technology. Blockchain.

Intelligent Decision Support for Cybersecurity Incident Response Teams: Autonomic Architecture and Mitigation Search.Critical infrastructures must be able to mitigate, at runtime, suspected ongoing cyberattacks that have eluded preventive security measures. To tackle this issue, we first propose an autonomic computing architecture for a Cyber-Security Incident Response Team Intelligent Decision Support System (CSIRT-IDSS) with a precise set of technologies for each of its components. We then zoom in on the component responsible for proposing to the CSIRT, automatically ranked sets of runtime actions to mitigate suspected ongoing cyber-attacks. We formalize its task as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP). We then propose to implement it by a Constraint Object-Oriented Logic Program (COOLP) deployed as a containerized web service through the integration of three orthogonal extensions of Logic Programming (LP): Web Service Oriented LP (WSOLP), Constraint LP (CLP) and Object-Oriented LP (OOLP). This integration supports seamlessly reusing platform and task independent cybersecurity ontological knowledge to dynamically build a mitigation action search COP that is customized to an input suspected cyberattack action set. This customization then allows the COP, to be solved by a generic CLP engine efficiently enough to propose mitigation actions to the CSIRT team while they can still be effective. To validate this approach, we implemented a prototype called CARMAS (Cyber Attack Runtime Mitigation Action Search) and ran scalability tests on simulated attacks with various COP construction strategies.

Faking Smart Industry: A Honeypot-Driven Approach for Exploring Cyber Security Threat Landscape.The digital evolution of Industry 4.0 enabled Operational Technology (OT) infrastructures to operate and remotely maintain cyber-physical systems bridging over IT infrastructures. It has also expanded new attack surfaces and steadily increased the number of malicious cyber incidents for the interconnected smart critical systems. Within Industrial Control System (ICS), Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) plays a crucial function to bridge between cyber and physical environments which made them the victim of sophisticated cyber-attacks that are designed to interrupt and damage their operations. Honeypots have been used as a key tool for aggregating real threat data e.g., malicious activities and payloads, to observe and determine different attack methods and strategies that can easily affect poorly secured cyber-physical systems. In this research, we deployed T-pot honeypot in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2) instance across six different regions to determine the current threat landscape as well as how knowledgeable and ingenious threat actors could be in compromising internet-facing Industrial Control System (ICS).

Unauthorized usage and cybersecurity risks in additively manufactured composites: Toolpath reconstruction using imaging and machine learning techniques.The field of Additive manufacturing techniques has witnessed tremendous growth in recent years. It is considered to be one of the forerunners of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, owing to its immense potential to transform the manufacturing industry with its high efficiency compared to the conventional techniques. AM techniques are increasingly being employed for producing 'customized' composite materials with tailored properties suitable for user-specific applications, including safety-critical systems like satellite components. However, there exists some drawbacks in AM parts such as inconsistency in part quality, porosity control, etc. which can lead to huge financial loss and damage in industrial production, thereby hindering the expected growth in adoption of AM systems by various industries. Some of the countermeasures against these cases was development of in-line monitoring systems including advanced sensors and computing capabilities including application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) which has proven to be effective in defect detection and quality assessment. However, the processes develop to be more data-intensive and dependent on computerization, which makes the system vulnerable to cyber-intrusion. The chain of attacks possible includes modification of the design file and manipulation of printing parameters such as thermal (nozzle temperature) and filament values. These may not be easily detectable without mechanical testing, effectively sabotaging the manufactured part. Another risk, which has emerged recently is the possibility of counterfeit production of high-quality AM parts. It has been shown to be possible in fibre reinforced composites using reverse engineering, by the misuse of ML techniques on imaging results to reconstruct toolpath information. In this paper, we try to focus on these shortcomings of AM techniques by discussing the severity and impacts of these risks and the current state-of-the art countermeasures including steady process monitoring and intellectual property (IP) protection. This is vital in identifying future issues to be addressed for continuous process improvement and increasing adoption of AM. 3D printing.

Autoencoder-Based Baseline Parameterized by Central Limit Theorem for ICS Cybersecurity.Industrial control system as the core of the industry is concerned about the cybersecurity problem and vulnerable to be threatened by the cyber-attacker. However, the conventional IDS aims to mine intrusion features and realizes intrusion detection by matching the abstract features of intrusion, so it could not recognize unknown and zero-day intrusion. In fact, the ICS as the closed-loop control system is different from the commercial internet and has stable interactive features. In the paper, we analyze the ICS network interaction and construct a parameterized baseline by an autoencoder to detect the intrusion. The experiment with an open ICS dataset shows that this baseline could achieve intrusion detection accuracy above 90% and the false alarm rate below 5%. Autoencoder. Baseline.

Ethical hacking: Skills to fight cybersecurity threats. Ethical hacking education prepares future information security professionals with the tools and skills to fight and prevent cybersecurity threats. Businesses, schools, governments, and individuals have an increasing concern to keep their systems, networks, and data secure from outside threats. Most information security technologies use a defensive approach to keep client’s data safe. however, ethical hacking provides one of the only proactive/aggressive methods for information security professionals to utilize. Teaching inexperienced information security professionals these aggressive tactics can be viewed as a double-edged sword. Since they are the same methods used by malicious hackers, educating new security professionals will undoubtedly educate more malicious hackers.

In addition, we identified the areas where artificial intelligence can be applied to the proposed cybersecurity test and evaluation system, and suggested future development plans. Through this, we supplemented our ability to support major decisions by integrating mission-based risk assessment factors into the cybersecurity test and evaluation system research conducted so far to identify risks in a timely manner between acquisition projects. cybersecurity. mission. test and evaluation 
A Study on Social Engineering Attacks in Cybersecurity.Due to improvements in data communication technology, humans can communicate with each other in the world instantly. Private and confidential information available on virtual community and e-services is not protected because of the absence of security procedures. Therefore, communication systems are more exposed and can be breached by malevolent users by means of social engineering attacks. These attacks are achieved by misleading people or organizations into performing activities that are advantageous to attackers or giving secret information like transaction codes, unique identification numbers, medical archives, and passwords. Social engineering attack is one of the major challenges in the field of security since it misuses the human inclination toward trust. This paper presents a detailed review on social engineering attacks, taxonomies, detection approaches, and prevention measures. Cybersecurity. Phishing. Scams. Social Engineering Attacks

A Cyber Security Situational Awareness Extraction Method Oriented to Imbalanced Samples. Due to the cyber security data contains a small proportion of attack data that cannot be effectively detected, and it is difficult for the traditional cyber security situation element acquisition model to extract accurate situation data from it. Therefore, this paper proposes a situational extraction method for uneven samples based on deep learning. First, use the CNN classifier to extract the characteristics of the cyber security data to obtain the classification accuracy of the original data set. Then, the deep convolution generation confrontation network (DCGAN) generates a uniform training data set on the basis of the original data set for small samples, and maps the network data to a two-dimensional matrix, which solves the problem of insufficient samples and sample imbalance. finally, Based on the balanced training data set, experiments are carried out on small samples through transfer learning. Experiments on the benchmark data set KDD'99 show that the data processing methods of transfer learning for small samples of R2L and U2R can obtain classification accuracy of 97.10% and 87.86%, respectively. Compared with the traditional model, the classification accuracy has been significantly improved. Cyber security. Deep convolutional generative adversarial network. Situation extraction.

Fuzzy Game-Theoretic Modeling of a Multi-Agent Cybersecurity Management System for an Agricultural Enterprise.Today, in the context of growing cybercrime, corporate networks including agricultural networks require adequate protection against external cyber-attacks. A four-level model of cybersecurity management multi-agent system (MAS) of agricultural enterprise, based on the Cyber Situational Awareness paradigm, is proposed. For modeling the interaction between attack agents and protection agents, it is proposed to use the apparatus of fuzzy game theory, in particular—fuzzy game with nature. The aim is not to find the best solution, but to find winning strategies that form a fuzzy knowledge base and obtain a fuzzy system security function. The main study purpose is to analyze and substantiate the introduction of fuzzy game models in the information security management system of agricultural enterprises corporate networks. The hypothesis of the study is to explore the possibility of using fuzzy game models, in particular games with nature, in the cyber defense management systems of agricultural enterprises. The theoretical and methodological basis is the methodology of Game theory and the main Fuzzy logic provisions. The proposed models provide an opportunity to improve an agricultural enterprises cyber security management system. Using modern methods of corporate networks protection, the management of the agricultural enterprise will be aware of the real state of the external cyber threat. The proposed approach allows to consider fuzzy indicators to estimate the amount of losses in different scenarios, which can significantly reduce the large number of computational operations in decision-making in the process of adverse situations.

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Protection: A Review.The cybersecurity threat landscape has lately become overly complex. Threat actors leverage weaknesses in the network and endpoint security in a very coordinated manner to perpetuate sophisticated attacks that could bring down the entire network and many critical hosts in the network. Increasingly advanced deep and machine learning-based solutions have been used in threat detection and protection. The application of these techniques has been reviewed well in the scientific literature. Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown great promise in developing AI-based solutions for areas that had earlier required advanced human cognizance. Different techniques and algorithms under deep reinforcement learning have shown great promise in applications ranging from games to industrial processes where it is claimed to augment systems with general AI capabilities. These algorithms have recently also been used in cybersecurity, especially in threat detection and endpoint protection, where these are showing state-of-the-art results. Unlike supervised machine and deep learning, deep reinforcement learning is used in more diverse ways and are empowering many innovative applications in the threat defense landscape. However, there does not exist any comprehensive review of these unique applications and accomplishments. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive review of the different applications of deep reinforcement learning in cybersecurity threat detection and protection.

SDGen: A Scalable, Reproducible and Flexible Approach to Generate Real World Cyber Security Datasets.Real world cyber security datasets are essential for developing and evaluating new techniques to counter cyber attacks. Ideally, these datasets should represent modern network infrastructures with up-to-date cyber attacks. However, existing datasets commonly used by researchers are either synthetic, unscalable or easily outdated due to the dynamic network infrastructure and evolving nature of cyber attacks. In this paper, we introduce a security dataset generator (SDGen) which focuses on a scalable, reproducible and flexible approach to generate real world datasets for detection and response against cyber attacks. We implement SDGen within a virtual environment using DetectionLab, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack with Beats and AttackIQ (a security control validation platform). This implementation in fact provides a proof-of-concept (POC) of SDGen to demonstrate the dataset generation of an organisation being compromised by several types of Ransomware. We showcase that our proposed dataset generator, SDGen, provides scalability, reproducibility and flexibility in generating cyber security datasets by modifying the configurations in DetectionLab, VagrantFiles and launching different types of attacks in AttackIQ.

The Effectiveness of Outsourcing Cybersecurity Practices: A Study of the Italian Context.The increasing number of cyber-attacks requires an organizational awareness about the disruptive effects of fraud attempts and acts of vandalism on business continuity and, sometimes, on company survival. The context influences the way companies use and adapt these theories in practice, so we consider in this study differences in the effectiveness of cybersecurity best practices between organizations that manage internally or outsource the cybersecurity processes. We conducted a study involving 153 managers’ experts in cybersecurity who responded to a survey on the effectiveness of NIST procedures. Results revealed significant differences in the effectiveness of managing cybersecurity in-house or outsource it. Specifically, major differences can be observed in the variables related to the use of disciplinary processes, the protection of log information, and the use of lessons learned to improve recovery plans. These differences provide further insights for cybersecurity management literature and a practical instrument for organizations willing to adapt their cyber processes to their organizational context.

Cybersecurity Threats and Vulnerabilities in Energy Transition to Smart Electricity Grids.National electricity grids and their respective system operators play a critical role in the modernisation and digitisation of our societies. The ongoing transition to smarter grids and demand response systems, the integration of new technologies and also new consumer behaviours, as well as other challenges such as the need to improve efficiency and connect to more intermittent types of generations are all part of a plethora of opportunities which also embed a large variety of new vulnerabilities and risks. In particular, with most systems being in the digital world, this exponentially increases the risks of cyberattacks, putting at risk entire systems of smart grids and creating new challenges for the national grid to manage these threats as it moves to a more system operation-focused entity from previously a more static, distribution-focused role. This calls for the need to improve or create new defence strategies, capabilities and mechanisms. This chapter first identifies the most exploited vulnerabilities in the software, hardware and network layers of national electricity grids. It then explores the threats these systems are exposed to, based on their respective vulnerabilities. Finally, it aims to offer a view of the most efficient current defence solutions – as well as a glimpse into the need for the development of new protective solutions and mechanisms. Cybersecurity.

Organisational Contexts of Energy Cybersecurity.The energy system is going through huge transformation to integrate distributed renewable generation and to achieve the goals of net-zero carbon emissions. This involves a significant adjustment to how the system is controlled and managed, with increasing digitalisation of technology and growing complexities across interconnected systems. Traditionally electricity networks adjusted their supply of energy in response to changes in demand. The future energy system will require more flexible demand to be able to use or store energy when renewables are generating. This change is exacerbated by additional demand for electricity for heat and transport uses. Utility organisations hold responsibility for securing their networks and assuring the supply of electricity. This paper describes a full investigation of cybersecurity issues and concerns for utilities. This industry review was carried out to create a clear organisational context for the ongoing design of cybersecurity improvements. The assessment of potential impact and consequences of cyber-attack is recommended to direct necessary preparations towards protecting essential functions and processes. Improving resilience across interdependent actors is discussed and resilience measures suggested to guide the contributions of different actors towards whole system resilience.

Investigating Cyber Security Awareness Among Preservice Teachers During the COVID-19 Pandemic.South African institutions of higher education suffered serious disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic which, resulted in migrating most teaching and learning activities to various online platforms, of which many depended on the open web. This has the potential to expose lecturers and students to cyber security threats and risks. As such cyber security awareness (CSA) becomes important. This study investigated the CSA among preservice teachers pursuing a Bachelor of Education studies in Further Education and Training (FET) at a university in Cape Town, South Africa. The purpose of the study was to gain an insight into CSA among preservice teachers who had been using digital technologies to support learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. An electronic questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 300 preservice teachers. The findings show that preservice teachers were limited in their awareness of cyber security threats and risks likely to affect their use of various digital technologies for remote learning. Furthermore, preservice teachers implemented basic strategies to mitigate basic cyber security threats and attacks. These basic strategies were found not to be sufficient for advanced attacks. The study concluded that lack of proper CSA and knowledge among preservice teachers presented them with challenges in solving threat attacks associated with denial-of-service (DoS), data theft and phishing when using personal digital devices.
A Cybersecurity Ontology to Support Risk Information Gathering in Cyber-Physical Systems.The goal of this paper is to define an extended cybersecurity ontology, which may be used to assist in targeted information gathering and risk assessment procedures applied on complex cyber-physical systems. The proposed ontology unifies information from an extensive collection of known cybersecurity datasets, semi-structured or unstructured (text) data from public security reports, environmental security information gathered from network security tools that may be applied in networks and systems under assessment, as well as information about threat actors and valid users of existing infrastructures. In order to demonstrate the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed cybersecurity ontology, we have implemented part of the ontology as a knowledge graph using Python and Neo4J. To validate the efficacy of such a security ontology in practical security assessments of complex cyber-physical systems, two practical application and validation scenarios are presented. In the first case we apply our ontology to fill in some gaps into the National Vulnerability Database, by utilizing a logistic classifier trained by a subset of the NVD, with the purpose of predicting missing values for recorded vulnerabilities. In the second validation scenario, we demonstrate how to extract additional connections and relationships between known security catalogues and databases such as NVD, CWE, CAPEC and Intel-TAL.

Analysis of Cyber Security Features in Industry 4.0 Maturity Models.The increasing digitization and networking of machines and plants has been leading to significant changes in the industrial sector for several years. Particularly in combination with the Internet and other disruptive technologies such as cloud computing, many opportunities and new business models are emerging. This change in industry is subsumed under the term Industry 4.0 and represents an important basis for the future economic success of many companies, especially small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. However, there are also many risks associated with this transformation, particularly with regard to cyber security. Against the backdrop of increasing dependence on networked information technology, the attack surface of companies is increasing. To address the problem, executives need to know the current state of their companies’ security maturity. To this end, it is necessary to assess the negative impact on business caused by cyber security attacks in Industry 4.0. So-called maturity models are useful instruments for this purpose. However, it has not yet been thoroughly investigated which maturity models from the literature can be used to assess cyber security in the context of Industrie 4.0 technologies. We have therefore developed a methodology to identify maturity models related to Industrie 4.0 and analyze them with respect to their applicability in the cyber security context. The aim is to use the analysis to identify maturity models most relevant to industry for the cross-sectional topic of cyber security in Industrie 4.0. The results can then be used by companies when integrating security strategies into their own corporate strategy. Cyber security. Industry 4.0. Maturity models 
An Empirical Investigation of Agile Information Systems Development for Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity has been identified as a major challenge confronting the digital world, neglecting cybersecurity techniques during software design and development increases the risk of malicious attacks. Thus, there is a need to make security an integral part of the agile information system development process. In this exploratory study, we empirically explore the agile security practices adopted by software developers and security professionals. Data was collected by conducting ten semi-structured interviews with agile practitioners from seven companies in the United Kingdom (UK). The study was conducted between August–November 2020. An approach informed by grounded theory was used for data analysis including Open coding, Memoing, Constant comparison and Theoretical saturation. The security practices identified in this study were categorized into roles, ceremonies and artefacts and mapped onto the different phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). We discovered practitioners use five artefacts: security backlog documentation, software security baseline standards, security test plan templates, information security and security audit checklists. and that there are more artefacts than roles and ceremonies. Also, while most practitioners rely on automated tools for software security testing, only one practitioner mentioned conducting security tests manually. These practices that we have identified comprise a novel taxonomy which form the main research contribution of this paper. Agile information systems development. Agile security practices.

Cybersecurity Mechanisms for Information Security in Patients of Public Hospitals in Ecuador.Information is considered the most important asset for most organizations in the healthcare sector, being sensitive and critical as it contains detailed patient data on their socioeconomic status, analysis, diagnoses and medical treatments that are administered by healthcare centers, avoiding unauthorized alteration or theft of data, which is a latent problem that can affect both the information systems managed in these environments and patients. Cybersecurity in public hospitals must be in line with clear assurance policies, in order to respond quickly and effectively to any type of threat, which are becoming more and more advanced. This paper analyzes the current situation of security and confidentiality of patient information in type II public hospitals in Ecuador, establishing an analysis methodology based on laws, standards, agreements and national and international regulations, applied to each of the health entities taken as a sample. Finally, guidelines are defined for an adequate treatment of patient information, which is an essential component of data confidentiality. As a result, it was found that patient information in the health units becomes a control mechanism in accordance with HIPAA and ISO 27799, and this study also shows the shortcomings in the assurance of patient information, despite the efforts made by the institutions, so that processes for continuous improvement are proposed.

Attack Path Analysis and Cost-Efficient Selection of Cybersecurity Controls for Complex Cyberphysical Systems.The increasing integration of information technology with operational technology leads to the formation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that intertwine physical and cyber components and connect to each other. This interconnection enables the offering of functionality beyond the combined offering of each individual component, but at the same time increases the cyber risk of the overall system, as such risk propagates between and aggregates at component systems. The complexity of the resulting systems in many cases leads to difficulty in analyzing cyber risk. Additionally, the selection of cybersecurity controls that will effectively and efficiently treat the cyber risk is commonly performed manually, or at best with limited automated decision support. In this paper, we extend our previous work in [1] to analyze attack paths between CPSs on one hand, and we improve the method proposed therein for selecting a set of security controls that minimizes both the residual risk and the cost of implementation. We use the DELTA demand-response management platform for the energy market stakeholders such as Aggregators and Retailers [2] as a use case to illustrate the workings of the proposed approaches. The results are sets of cybersecurity controls applied to those components of the overall system that have been identified to lie in those attack paths that have been identified as most critical among all the identified attack paths.

Cybersecurity Analysis via Process Mining: A Systematic Literature Review.The digitalization of our society is only possible in secure software systems governing ongoing critical processes. The understanding of mutual interdependencies of events and processes is crucial for cybersecurity. One of the promising ways to tackle these challenges is process mining, which is a set of techniques that aim to mine knowledge from processes. However, it is unclear how process mining can be practically used in the context of cybersecurity. In this work, we investigate the potential of applying process mining in cybersecurity and support research efforts in this area via collecting existing applications, discussing current trends, and providing promising research directions. To this end, we have conducted a systematic literature review covering all relevant works between 2014 and 2020. Cybersecurity. Literature review. Process mining

Semantic Embedding-Based Entity Alignment for Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs.This paper proposes a new framework that can semantically align the two or more entities in cybersecurity-related Knowledge Graphs (KGs) using an external resource. To do so, we identify four main principles that the external resources must have and then use them to analyze various external resources. The resource is used to find sentences that are needed to understand the usage context of the entities. The entity alignment is performed by semantic embedding with BERT. At this time, semantic embedding is defined as a vector that contains the latent semantic features of the sentences only with similar usage context from the external resource encoded with the language model BERT. To identify the sentences with similar usage context, we first classify the informative entities related to the target entities. Using the informative entities, we generate a set of sentences that have used similar usage context. Finally, to predict semantic relationships (equivalence) between the entities, we employ pre-trained BERT with the set of sentences as input. To prove the superiority of the framework, we perform the experiments to evaluate the accuracy of prediction of equivalence of entities from the different KGs. Cybersecurity. Entity alignment.

Industrial Control System Cybersecurity Assessment Handling Delay Estimation.Nowadays, industrial control systems are becoming more digital, more complex, and more interconnected causing growing anxiety about their safety, security, and especially cybersecurity. For dealing with all security problems including cybersecurity assessment, security programs are utilized where the properties of confidentiality and integrity are characterized in detail. But the availability attribute often suffers due to a lack of attention, which makes the assessment of availability grow into one of the thorniest issues. The article investigates cybersecurity in the industrial control systems context, clarifies the great value of availability, and explains a reasonable shift between cybersecurity and availability assessment problems. A delay of the signal transmission is discovered to be a suitable measure of the quantitative availability assessment, and a theory of deterministic queuing systems Network calculus is advocated to be a relevant tool for the delay estimation and availability modelling. A reference model for the availability assessment and also an appropriate metric based on delay and system dependency are proposed. The results of the verification of the applicability of Network calculus to solving the delay estimation and cybersecurity assessment problems are presented. Availability. Cybersecurity. Delay.

Assessment of Cyber Security Maturity for Critical Domains in Republic of Moldova.In this paper we present the evaluation results based on the model for cyber security maturity assessment upon the cyber security program development for critical infrastructures (CI) in Republic of Moldova [1]. During last year the healthcare domains has become a target of strategic interest amongst cyber criminals. These events can lead not only to security breaches, but also to safety events that affect human lives. The findings confirm the recommendations of previous case studies on evaluation of cyber security requirements for healthcare inclusive nuclear and radiological domain. Therefore, we classify the results based on the dimensions of the recently developed Model for Cyber Security Maturity Assessment in CI [1]. The proposed model focuses on four primary dimensions: policies and administration, education and training, work environment, cyber risk management. It has been developed with the goal to help decision makers analyze the efficiency of information systems used for cyber risk management. The model is multidimensional and can also show the actual state of cyber security maturity in an organization, fact which was also proven by external reviews. The experimental test of this analysis confirm the applicability of the Model for organizations at different stages of cyber security development, as well as from different domains.

Evaluation of Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity Using Inductive Node Embedding with Convolutional Graph Neural Networks.In the face of continuous cyberattacks, many scientists have proposed machine learning-based network anomaly detection methods. While deep learning effectively captures unseen patterns of Euclidean data, there is a huge number of applications where data are described in the form of graphs. Graph analysis have improved detecting anomalies in non-Euclidean domains, but it suffered from high computational cost. Graph embeddings have solved this problem by converting each node in the network into low dimensional representation, but it lacks the ability to generalize to unseen nodes. Graph convolution neural network methods solve this problem through inductive node embedding (inductive GNN). Inductive GNN shows better performance in detecting anomalies with less complexity than graph analysis and graph embedding methods. Anomaly detection. Convolutional graph neural network.

Organizing Cybersecurity in Action: A Pragmatic Ethical Reasoning Approach.This paper contributes to the literature on cybersecurity governance by suggesting an approach based on pragmatism. As Jeffrey Sachs in his The Age of Sustainable Development, 2015, reminds us: The essence of sustainable development in practice is scientifically and morally based problem solving. Cybersecurity deals with problem solving in complex socio-technical settings where ethics and organizational learning are tightly related. The paper draws on pragmatism because from its earliest formulation, pragmatist thought was anchored to a dual interest in ethics and science. Under this lens, pragmatic ethics cannot exist as a set of rules or principles, but rather requires a cyclical, empirical process whereby ethical principles and context interact to promote justice among stakeholders in the research of reliable solutions during the unravel of critical events. As a result, an Ethically oriented Cybersecurity Approach (ECA) based on Pragmatic Ethical Reasoning (PER) is proposed for managing unexpected critical events when organizations must learn on-the-fly and improve their security profiles.

A Framework to Achieve Cybersecurity Accountability of Critical Infrastructure Providers – A Design Science Research Approach.Today’s pervasive use of information systems (IS) not only comes with many opportunities but also with considerable risks especially in relation to cyberattacks, which become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous. Especially organizations providing critical infrastructures are at risk, which are held to account by governments to ensure sufficient protection. Governments request information to monitor cybersecurity levels of critical infra-structure providers over time, which are today subject to respective nation-wide legislation in developed economies. Following guidelines of design science research, this study offers a generic framework that supports continuous monitoring and benchmarking of an organization’s cybersecurity status. It is generic allowing application by different critical infrastructure providers and usage by government institutions to help achieve oversight of the nation-al cybersecurity status. Our design proposition is supported by an extensive review of academic literature, the consultation of relevant industry standards, and two main rounds of field interactions. The framework includes 15 major risk areas, and a collection of associated metrics and controls, which cover material and social mechanisms. We would like to note that our domain of study would require more design work that targets knowledge accumulation spanning academic research and industry practice. Critical infrastructures.

Portuguese Concerns and Impact on Behaviour About Cybersecurity: A Comparison with the European Average.The advancement of the Internet has great potential for the well-being of citizens and business growth, but this new paradigm also entails cybersecurity challenges that can have high economic impacts. The growth of Internet use is also leading to a general increase in cybercrime concerns as well as the number of users’ victims of this permanent threat. This reality is also very present in Portugal as well as in other European countries. In this context, it is important to know some indicators associated with cybersecurity, to take the best measures/actions in a reasoned way, and to combat this phenomenon. This article presents the results of a study carried out in 2019 by the European Commission, whose analysis helps to understand the Portuguese positioning in the concerns and attitudes about cybercrime, to the average of the European Community citizens. Analysing this study, it was possible to perceive that the Portuguese’s concerns about cybercrime are in line with the average of the European citizens, although the percentage of Portuguese that takes attitudes and actions to combat cyber-threats is a little bit above the average recorded by citizens of European countries.

Minimization of Cyber Security Threats Caused by COVID-19 Pandemic.Whilst the world is preoccupied in its struggle with the Coronavirus pandemic, cyber-criminals are busy every day, spreading their own viruses, by phishing emails, data breaches, frauds, denials of service, and taking advantage of the vulnerabilities created by this crisis. In many ways, we, as a nation, are handing over our data without realizing it, without fully thinking it through or even being aware of cyber threats, which will ultimately have a tremendous impact on the governments and citizens both personally and at work. The goal of this paper is to investigate the correlation between the cyberattacks before the coronavirus and during the coronavirus in order to build an understanding of what is happening. To optimize cyber security and provide effective ways to tackle cyber security attacks during COVID-19 or something similar, we need to consider extra precautions and take a more secure approach to protection. To minimize the universal risks of data breaches and other cyber incidents, we need to enforce practical steps to deal with and if possible limit those risks. This requires not only thoughtful consideration, but also a good understanding of the opportunities that COVID-19 provides to cyber-criminals. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the growth of and reasons for the increase of cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to make better cyber security decisions, we need to address and maximize the level of cyber security awareness and precaution taken during COVID-19. A set of practical steps to minimize the risk of cyber-attack is provided to compensate for the vulnerabilities associated with COVID-19. COVID-19 pandemic. Cyber-attack. Cyber-criminal. Data breach.

A Search Engine for Scientific Publications: A Cybersecurity Case Study.Cybersecurity is a very challenging topic of research nowadays, as digitalization increases the interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it. The field is broad and has a lot of unexplored ground under numerous disciplines such as management, psychology, and data science. Its large disciplinary spectrum and many significant research topics generate a considerable amount of information, making it hard for us to find what we are looking for when researching a particular subject. This work proposes a new search engine for scientific publications which combines both information retrieval and reading comprehension algorithms to extract answers from a collection of domain-specific documents. The proposed solution although being applied to the context of cybersecurity exhibited great generalization capabilities and can be easily adapted to perform under other distinct knowledge domains.
Investigating Cyber Security Awareness (CSA) Amongst Managers in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Cyber-attacks have received a lot of attention in recent years due to the increased number of attacks, and subsequently risk of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical personal and business data. Attack vectors are evolving and become more complex, raising the need for computer user training on how to safely operate in cyberspace. Unfortunately, cyber security training is not a priority to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in a developing country such as South Africa as it does not directly improve profits. As a result, SMEs are left vulnerable to ever-changing cyber-attacks. The study investigated the current level of cybersecurity awareness amongst managers in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa. Fifteen SMEs residing in the economic hub of South Africa participated in the qualitative study through the use of structured interviews. The results indicated that SMEs are aware of cybersecurity threats as they experience many at the moment, and understand related cybersecurity concepts and possible consequences of a cybersecurity breach. However, budget and time constraints were identified as the main challenges when cybersecurity awareness programs are considered. In addition, IT tasks are often outsourced, negatively influencing the control over the implementation of cybersecurity measures. Although some organizations indicated that they have cyber security policies in place, these policies were often not regularly updated and enforced. As a result, it is recommended that: (a) SMEs should make renewed efforts to foster cybersecurity awareness amongst employees. (b) develop and continuously adjust cybersecurity policies. and (c) prioritize the implementation and education of cybersecurity concepts. Cyber risks. Cyber security. Risk mitigation.

An Integrated System for Connecting Cybersecurity Competency, Student Activities and Career Building.For educators, preparing students who are able to solve cybersecurity problems requires not only a curriculum that provides students with interdisciplinary knowledge but also activities that develop their skills and competencies to solve problems that call for an interdisciplinary approach. To facilitate this process, we have developed a system called Cyberpassport, which integrates students’ academic and career goals with cybersecurity co-curricular activities. This system is designed for students to search and register for cybersecurity activities, and track their own progress, for advisors to support their mentoring efforts, and for activity hosts such as faculty members or industry professionals to facilitate connection with interested students. Usability testing was conducted to test the application’s functionality as well as user experience and interest. Preliminary results indicate that users found the system easy to use and beneficial for a career in cybersecurity. Furthermore, this is the first mobile events app developed that aligns with the skills and competencies defined by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) cybersecurity workforce framework.

Automated Corpus Annotation for Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition with Small Keyword Dictionary.In order to assist security analysts in obtaining information pertaining to the cybersecurity tailored to the security domain are needed. Since labeled text data is scarce and expensive, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used to detect the relevant domain entities from the raw text. To train a new NER model for cybersecurity, traditional NER requires a training corpus annotated with cybersecurity entities. Our previous work proposed a Human-Machine Interaction method for semi-automatic labeling and corpus generation for cybersecurity entities. This method requires small dictionary that has the pairs of keywords and their categories, and text data. However, the semantic similarity measurement in the method to solve the ambiguous keywords requires the specific category names even if non cybersecurity related categories. In this work, we introduce another semantic similarity measurement using text category classifier which does not require to give the specific non cybersecurity related category name. We compare the performance of the two semantic similarity measurements, and the new measurement performs better. The experimental evaluation result shows that our method with the training data that is annotated by small dictionary performs almost same performance of the models that are trained with fully annotated data.

Cyber Security in Cloud: Risk Assessment Models.The present paper shows a proposal of the characteristics Cloud Risk Assessment Models should have and presents the review of the literature considering those characteristics in order to identify current gaps. This work shows a ranking of Cloud RA models and their degree of compliance with the theoretical reference Cloud Risk Assessment model. The review of literature shows that RA approaches leveraging CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) STAR Registry that have into account organization’s security requirements present higher degree of compliance but they still lack risk economic quantification. The myriad of conceptual models, methodologies and frameworks although based on current NIST SP 800:30, ISO 27001, ISO 27005, ISO 30001, ENISA standards could be enhanced by the use of techno-economic models like UTEM, created by the author, in order to conceive more simplified models for effective Risk Assessment and Mitigation closer to the theoretical reference model for Cloud Risk Assessment, available for all cloud models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and easy to use for all stakeholders.

A Secure Environment to Measure and Manage Cybersecurity Lab Activities.Implementation and management of a secure environment for online cybersecurity lab experiments is challenging for several reasons. In addition to normal issues associated with hardening a remote lab environment against unauthorized user access and network data transmissions leaking outside the lab environment, the very nature of cybersecurity lab experiments can be inherently dangerous. For example, management network traffic from lab activities may be sniffed using common cybersecurity utilities, the results of lab activity assessment might be hacked and modified, and IT devices used to analyze lab progress may be attacked and compromised. Finally, it is critical for academic integrity that student assessment is secure, assertable, consistent, and repeatable. The environment we created provides both educational processes and game based, hands-on exercises, where students can learn the concepts and best practices in cybersecurity defense as well as hands-on skills learning. An initial assessment was taken at a recent train-the-trainer workshop, and several lab learning and effectiveness metrics are provided. Copyright . Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity gamification.

A Game-Based Multiplayer System for Cyber Security Training and Awareness.This paper discusses a set of cyber security labs to help students learn the fundamentals of cyber security. Each lab included a combination of theoretical and practical knowledge education. The theoretical learning introduced the background and techniques of cyber security while the practical learning aspect helped students gain a deeper understanding through hands-on activities. In total, eight labs were designed to help students acquire knowledge and exercise skills. Each lab included two sub-labs: attack and defense. The attack labs led students to find system vulnerabilities and model the actions of attacks. The defense labs required students to identify and fix system vulnerabilities. A system infrastructure was designed that included a number of identical and isolated learning environments. Virtual machines (VMs) were installed in each environment and served as tasks of both attack and defense. Each student owned his/her environment. In an attack sub-lab, students exploited vulnerabilities and launched attacks against other students' VMs. In a defense sub-lab, students implemented protection mechanisms on their VMs to prepare the best defense against cyber-attacks.

CYBERSECURITY: PANORAMA AND IMPLEMENTATION IN 2021. Cyber threats have changed the universe of enterprise security. These threats are often difficult to determine and locate particularly in the digital and mobile era. Cybercriminals behind these threats possess knowledge, intelligence, creativity, flexibility, and resilience, which increase with time. Security measures taken to mitigate these threats require the cooperation of multiple security disciplines, because a single discipline cannot address the issues of growing threats. This paper first presents the panorama of cybersecurity and its components. subsequently, it reviews the cybersecurity landscape in terms of various frameworks, models, and recommendations issued from specialized organizations and institutions such as NIST, ISO, CSI, and ISACA. This paper attempts to guide enterprises to navigate this supercharged landscape as well as to implement a sound cybersecurity model that is suitable for a specified industry and situation. A methodology was developed in this study. The methodology recommends a framework that is based on a cross section of standard frameworks but adapted to the levels of decision making in the enterprise. The proposed methodology was applied to an institution in the public sector, whereby the cybersecurity panorama was explored, and the best practices suitable for the activity and the processes of the institution were implemented. Thus, a project with defined phases was executed. The methodology also suggests a sense of continuity, as cybersecurity is a never-ending endeavour. CIS controls. Cybercrime. Cybersecurity.

Reproducible and Adaptable Log Data Generation for Sound Cybersecurity Experiments.Artifacts such as log data and network traffic are fundamental for cybersecurity research, e.g., in the area of intrusion detection. Yet, most research is based on artifacts that are not available to others or cannot be adapted to own purposes, thus making it difficult to reproduce and build on existing work. In this paper, we identify the challenges of artifact generation with the goal of conducting sound experiments that are valid, controlled, and reproducible. We argue that testbeds for artifact generation have to be designed specifically with reproducibility and adaptability in mind. To achieve this goal, we present SOCBED, our proof-of-concept implementation and the first testbed with a focus on generating realistic log data for cybersecurity experiments in a reproducible and adaptable manner. SOCBED enables researchers to reproduce testbed instances on commodity computers, adapt them according to own requirements, and verify their correct functionality. We evaluate SOCBED with an exemplary, practical experiment on detecting a multi-step intrusion of an enterprise network and show that the resulting experiment is indeed valid, controlled, and reproducible. Both SOCBED and the log dataset underlying our evaluation are freely available. Cybersecurity. Intrusion detection. Log data. Reproducibility. Testbed 
Text mining to Discover Design Features for Cybersecurity tools: The case of Password Management Systems.Username and password are the most common authentication approach used today in cybersecurity. Most people have more than one online account protected by passwords. Managing passwords is one of the daunting tasks for most people. Therefore, users may rely on password management systems PMS to help creating, managing, retrieving, and storing passwords. However, there is still a lack of relying on and using such systems to manage users' passwords. This study aims to use a text mining approach to investigate the factors that influence users' behavior to use PMSs which leads to improve their security. This study adopts a text mining approach to uncover the design principles (features) of PMSs extracted from online users' reviews and feedbacks to improve the adoption of PMSs. Specifically, our study used a topic modeling algorithm to analyze users' feedback by collecting and analyzing the reviews of nine password management systems. The results indicate the need to address principles and design features related to compatibility, security, usefulness, ease of use, and customer care services. Design Principles. Password.

Assessing the effect of human factors in healthcare cyber security practice: An empirical study. Healthcare organizations are bound to face a multitude of challenges. quite special demands are directed to the data processing. This paper proposes a methodology for adopting security management principles in health sector environments, based on the guidelines of the ISO/IEC 27005:2018 standard. The purpose of this methodology is to identify and to assess the risks to which the information environment and the resources that make it up are exposed. A process is defined that identifies and evaluates the risks and the threats within a healthcare information system, with: (i) the identification, (ii) the documentation, (iii) the categorization, and finally (iv) the prioritization of risks arising from the handling, management, and storage of healthcare information. Based on the aforementioned targets, a risk management strategy is developed against the identified risks, while implementing the appropriate controls. The work is carried out in three steps: (i) Identification and Valuation of the Assets that are the subject of a Health Care Information System, (ii) Risk Analysis, and (iii) Risk Management. The outcome of this study can be used to determine the appropriate security controls (administrative, physical, technical, and operational) so as to minimize the risks together with the implementation of the appropriate information security controls.

A Dynamic Cyber Security Situational Awareness Framework for Healthcare ICT Infrastructures.The healthcare sectors have experienced a massive technical evolution over the past decade by integration of medical devices with IT at both physical and cyber level for a critical Health Care Information Infrastructure (HCII). HCII provides huge benefits for the health care service delivery but evolving digital interconnectivity among medical and IT devices has also changed the threat landscape. In particular, systems are now more exposed to the cyber-attacks due to sensitivity and criticality of patient health care information and accessibility of medical devices and this pose any potential disruption of healthcare service delivery. There is a need to enhance security and resilience of HCII. In this paper, we present a Cyber Security Situational Awareness Framework that aims to improve the security and resilience of the overall HCII. The framework aims to develop a novel dynamic Situational Awareness approach on the health care ecosystem. We consider bio inspired Swarm Intelligence and its inherent features with the main principles of the Risk and Privacy assessment and management and Incident handling to ensure security and resilience of healthcare service delivery.

Assessing the effect of human factors in healthcare cyber security practice: An empirical study.The main goal of this research paper is to address the problem of SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) diagnosis, exploring the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Up to date, very few research studies have been conducted regarding the application of machine learning algorithms focusing on efficient structures of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the diagnosis of ischemia in MPI images. In the presented work, the dataset consists of SPECT images in stress and rest representation, and a two-class classification problem corresponding to 262 normal and 251 ischemic cases is explored. The data augmentation technique was used for increasing the number of the training dataset by rotating the images and zooming randomly. In this research study, a simple but robust CNN model for automatic classification of MPI images in two categories, was applied, after a proper exploration process concerning different values for number of layers, dense nodes, convolutional parameters as well as batch size and pixel size. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy of 90.2075% and an AUC value of 93.77%. The results proved that the convolutional neural network is able to differentiate between normal and ischemic cases and would be a great assist to medical industry, when researching myocardial perfusion images. The model we are proposing is considered a valuable asset for this medical classification problem, as it manages to produce more reliable results compared to traditional clinical methods.

Assessing the effect of human factors in healthcare cyber security practice: An empirical study. In last decades, neuromorphic circuits have received widespread attention across various scientific fields. Such circuits mathematically model the behaviour of biological neurons, synapses as well as their interaction. This work implements a neuromorphic synapse on an FPGA board and it improves previously proposed synapses in terms of performance and synchronization to novel neuron implementations. The proposed architecture is designed with the goal of being compatible with neuromorphic neurons based on the mathematical equations of the Izhikevich neuron model. The implementation consists of two computation cores. one core is responsible for computing the update of currents and the second core is computing the exponential decays of currents. Compared to similar neuromorphic synapses, the proposed retains low complexity and can calculate the needed synaptic currents of the connected neurons quickly and reliably. The speed of computation achieved by the parallel execution of instructions indicates that the system can function in real time. Artificial neuron. Artificial synapse. Izhikevich model.

A Novel Cybersecurity Architecture for IoV Communication.The growth of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has brought out the need for secure data transfer between devices that are connected to the vehicle network. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) offers the ability to AVs in order to connect wirelessly not only to each other but to a variety of devices and entities that may use the same network. This ability for interconnection and the need for data exchange from the in-vehicle parts make the self-driving vehicle systems vulnerable to a variety of attacks that can be performed by a malicious user. This paper presents a secure architectural solution for data transfer and storage between data generated from in-vehicle components and cloud data management portal. The toolset for the data transfer includes: MQTT, LENSES.io, Apache KAFKA, MongoDB and Flask whereas, the tools and mechanisms which are used for cyber security are : KEYCLOAK, CLOUDFLARE, SNORT, NGINX and HASHING for integrity. The experiments conducted highlighted the performance of the solution regarding cyber security and revealed its potential for wider adoption. CLOUDFLARE. FLASK. KAFKA. KEYCLOAK. LENSES.io. MongoDB.

Assessing the effect of human factors in healthcare cyber security practice: An empirical study.In recent times, the human element plays a major role in the surge of data breaches in healthcare. As a result, we hypothesized that there are gaps between the information security (IS) practices of the healthcare staff and the security policies. We further opined that if there are gaps, the causes could be culminating from poor work factors, personality, psychological, social and cultural perception issues. As a result, a survey was conducted with three departments in a typical hospital to assess a broad range of these factors. From the study results, the healthcare staff' IS knowledge and their self reported IS conscious care behaviour (ISCCB) showed a gap in their security practices. About half of the respondents' responses were in a higher risk region. In exploring for the reasons for these gaps, Workload showed a negative significant correlation (r=-0.346, p-value= 0.05) with information security-conscious care behaviour(ISCCB) risk and perceived barrier risk (r=-.363, pvalue=0.05). But, the hospital information security culture showed negative significant correlation with perceived vulnerability (r=-0.316, pvalue= 0.05), cues to action (r=-0.508,pvalue=0.01), and punishment severity (r=-0.425, pvalue=0.05). Based on the findings of this study, some intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors can be explored to improve the security perceptions, and security culture of the hospital if causality is established.

Assessing the effect of human factors in healthcare cyber security practice: An empirical study.Emergency Departments globally suffer overcrowding due to the lack of adequate capacity and/or guidelines and policies for triaging patients. Medical service quality improvement requires optimal patient prioritization according to their level of urgency. This study aims to evaluate classification models predicting the admission or discharge of incidents triaged as level 3 according to the Emergency Severity Index algorithm. As such, adult patient visits were examined from a publicly available dataset. Feature Importance was used for the assessment of each variable contribution in predictions and a subset of 196 out of 972 variables of the original dataset was sampled. XGBoost, random forest, convolutional neural network, and k-nearest neighbors algorithms were deployed and evaluated regarding hospitalization prediction. Convolutional neural network utilization required a tabular data to image transformation which was applied using the Image Data Generator to Tabular Data (IGTD) algorithm. Benchmarking among the four algorithms showed that XGBoost outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 0.75, an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.74 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.54. Overall, machine learning-based assessment of the disposition of medium-risk patients according to ESI may lead to predictive models which constitute useful decision support tools.

Assessing the effect of human factors in healthcare cyber security practice: An empirical study. The constant increase in the number of patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, over the last few decades and the high cost of their medical care for health systems have led to the development of applications that address such widespread health service challenges. Diabetes, in particular, has undoubtedly reached epidemic proportions as its incidence is constantly increasing at a particularly high rate worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to present a twofold application that will be an easy-to-use tool to improve the patient's quality of life through the effective self-management of diabetes and at the same time will provide the treating physician with a complete picture of the patient's health. In order to achieve these goals, the proposed application was based on the seven self-management areas (AADE7) of the American Association of Diabetes Educators, which are healthy eating, physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, medication, treating complications, reducing the risk of complications and healthy treatment to reduce stress. The application was made available for testing to a number of users suffering from diabetes. following the researchers asked the patients who used the application for a whole week to participate in a structured evaluation. Main findings include inferences about the application usability, technical issues that should be solved and ideas for future extensions. Bluetooth integration, data synchronization with other applications or devices, data encryption and data sharing with the treating physician, are some of the most important extensions that could be implemented.

Parents, educators, & caregivers cybersecurity & privacy concerns for remote learning during COVID-19.In 2020, there was a sudden and internationally widespread shift towards remote learning, primarily stemming from a need to facilitate learning while also maintaining the physical safety of students and community members. While there are benefits to remote learning, increased integration and use of Internet Communication Technology (ICT) has the potential to create opportunities for cyber threats that exist within the digital environment. These threats can range from unauthorized use of webcam, an increased risk for phishing, to increased time spent online and risk of cyberbullying as well. To this aid, our goal is to seek to understand the users' privacy concerns and security risks related to the remote learning process. For this, we conducted a survey-based study with 520 participants. Through thematic analysis we obtained an understanding of the perceptions of parents, teachers, and caregivers of children attending online educational institutions. We found that most participants have experienced a cybersecurity or privacy-related incident pertaining to remote learning. We conclude by providing suggestions based on our findings to create a more secure and privacy-preserving online education experience for the users. Caregivers.. COVID-19. Educators.

Algorithms for detecting and preventing attacks on machine learning models in cyber-security problems.Machine learning algorithms can be vulnerable to many forms of attacks aimed at leading the machine learning systems to make deliberate errors. The article provides an overview of attack technologies on the models and training datasets for the purpose of destructive (poisoning) effect. Experiments have been carried out to implement the existing attacks on various models. A comparative analysis of cyber-resistance of various models, most frequently used in operating systems, to destructive information actions has been prepared. The stability of various models most often used in applied problems to destructive information influences is investigated. The stability of the models is shown in case of poisoning up to 50% of the training data.
Improving Multiclass Classification of Cybersecurity Breaches in Railway Infrastructure using Imbalanced Learning.Machine learning approaches and algorithms are spreading in wide areas in research and technology. Cybersecurity breaches are the common anomalies for networked and distributed infrastructures which are monitored, registered, and described carefully. However, the description of each security breaches episode and its classification is still a difficult problem, especially in highly complex telecommunication infrastructure. Railway information infrastructure usually has a large scale and large diversity of possible security breaches. Today's situation shows the registering of the security breaches has a mature and stable character, but the problem of their automated classification is not solved completely. Many studies on security breaches multiclass classification show inadequate accuracy of classification. We investigated the origins of this problem and suggested the possible roots consist in disbalance the datasets used for machine learning multiclass classification. Thus, we proposed an approach to improve the accuracy of the classification and verified our approach on the really collected datasets with cybersecurity breaches in railway telecommunication infrastructure. We analyzed the results of applying three imbalanced learning methodologies, namely random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, and the last one with Tomek links. We have implemented three machine learning algorithms, namely Naïve Bayes, K-means, and support vector machine, on disbalances and balanced data to estimate imbalance learning methodologies with comparing results. The proposed approach demonstrated the increase of the accuracy for multiclass classification in the range from 30 to 41%, depending on the imbalanced learning technique. Cybersecurity breaches.

Defining and Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenges of Additive Manufacturing Platforms.Additive Manufacturing (AM) Platform is a new technology and commercial business model which enables production of additively made parts through an on-line market of AM designs, services, and manufacturing. Customers who are designing parts to be manufactured with additive technologies can upload their designs to the AM Platform and find a manufacturing partner based on technical capabilities, geographic location, and cost. By providing an easy to use online platform, companies can expect to optimize their cost, quality, and lead-time through a competitive bid process. This research investigates the cybersecurity issues inherent to an online marketplace and platform which shares data containing Intellectual Property (IP) between multiple companies. Based on currently implemented business models in the AM Platform industry, the most common use cases will be examined to determine any vulnerabilities associated with data and IP sharing between the platform, its customers, and vendors. Finally, based on the vulnerabilities discovered, a set of cybersecurity solutions will be proposed in order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data and ultimately the customers IP through the AM Platform. am platform. am printing. cybersecurity. data integrity. data security. digital rights management. ip protection 
Cybersecurity Requirements for AM Systems: New Enforcement in DoD Environments, and Resources for Implementation. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for the US Department of Defense (DoD) released Audit of the Cybersecurity of Department of Defense Additive Manufacturing Systems (DODIG-2021-098) [1] in July 2021, to determine  whether DoD [sites] secured additive manufacturing (AM) systems to prevent unauthorized changes and ensure the integrity of the design data. The audit report recommends requiring  all AM systems to obtain an authority to operate in accordance with DoD policy before their use [1], and requiring  AM system owners to immediately identify and implement security controls to minimize risk until obtaining an authority to operate. [1] The DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) responded that existing DoD regulations require both of these for  all IT systems, including AM systems [1]. Such cyber security rules can help guard against vulnerabilities such as design file theft or digital thread hacking, as well as unauthorized prints on AM systems that can impact the safety and integrity of parts used in defense systems, expose critical intellectual property to bad actors and even cause manufacturing facilities to shut down. To improve AM system vendors' understanding of these cybersecurity requirements for DoD and the US Government (USG), we discuss in this paper the process for obtaining an Authority To Operate (ATO) certification for an IT system per DoD and USG cybersecurity regulations, i.e., the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [2]. We also describe resources for AM system vendors to understand and implement the RMF process for obtaining an ATO certification, particularly in the DoD environment.

Opportunities to Fail: Using Peer-review to support Assessment Literacy in Cyber Security.The importance of cyber security to the global economy has only grown in recent years. Effective cyber security technical policy is an important defence against numerous threats. Consequently, it is important that computing science and software engineering graduates are able to produce effective cyber security policy. However, written assessments, such as cyber security policy, for some students may be challenging due to lack of familiarity with such assessments. The lack of familiarity or poor assessment literacy not only has the potential to produce poor results, but can led to disappointment and frustration. In this poster, the practice of integrating peer-review as part of a cyber security policy assessment task to support assessment literacy is presented. The aim is to elicit feedback from conference participants not only on the practice itself, but on addressing the challenge of assessment literacy in the context of cyber security policy. assessment literacy. cyber security. peer-review 
Conceptual approach to implementation of the threat prevention subsystem of an operational cybersecurity center.One of the most promising trends of modern information security is proactive defense. Proactive defense has a number of significant advantages, which allow to overcome the fundamental limitations which are inherent to traditional reactive methods. It makes relevant the task of obtaining qualitative and quantitative characteristics of a security system, based on proactive information protection technologies. In this regard, the article discusses the issues of analysis and modeling attack prevention subsystems of operational cybersecurity centers. The cyber security operational center is a crucial component of a modern security infrastructure, which, at the same time, demonstrates basic properties of a protected object. Therefore it is selected as an example of a protected object. The research substantiates the effectiveness of proactive defense system and describes its echelons. The structural model is presented for operational cybersecurity center's threat prevention subsystem. The threat prevention subsystem's functional components' roles are described. On the basis of a model with full overlap and fuzzy indicators, a mathematical model of the threat prevention subsystem of the operational cybersecurity center is presented. The approach proposed is dictated not only by an increase in the functionality of modern technologies, but also by the requirements for the creation of adaptive integrated solutions that are scalable within the architecture to protect against various types of threats.
A comparison of SONA and MTurk for cybersecurity surveys.For almost every online account, people are required to create a password to protect their information online. Since many people have many accounts, they tend to create insecure passwords and re-use passwords. These insecure passwords are often easy to guess, which can lead to compromised data. It is well-known that every person has a different personality type, which can be determined using personality models such as Big Five and True Colors. This research examines if there is a link between personality type and password security among a variety of participants in two groups of participants: SONA and MTurk. Each participant in both surveys answered questions based on password security and their personality type. Our results show that participants in the MTurk survey were more likely to choose a strong password and to exhibit better security behaviors and knowledge than participants in the SONA survey. This is mostly attributed to the age difference. However, the distribution of the results was similar for both MTurk and SONA. Future surveys on cybersecurity should include both types of demographics for a more generalizable result. MTurk. Password Strength. Personality. SONA. Survey 
Analysis and application of intelligent power control system cyber security situation awareness based on wavelet neural network.In recent years, international industrial control network security incidents have occurred frequently. As a core component of the industrial control field, intelligent power control systems are increasingly threatened by external network attacks. Based on the current research status of power industrial control network security, closely combining the development of active monitoring and defense technology in the public network field and the problems encountered by network security operators in actual work, this paper uses data mining methods to study the power control system network security situation awareness technology. Combing operational data collection and integrated processing, situation index screening and extraction, we use wavelet neural network analysis method to train the sampled data set, and finally calculate the true value of the network security status through deep intelligent learning. Finally, we conclude that the artificial intelligence algorithm based on wavelet neural network can be used for power control system network security situation awareness. In actual work, it can predict the situation value for a period of time in the future and assist network security personnel in judgment and decision-making.
Detecting cyber security related Twitter accounts and different sub-groups: A multi-classifier approach.Many cyber security experts, organizations, and cyber criminals are active users on online social networks (OSNs). Therefore, detecting cyber security related accounts on OSNs and monitoring their activities can be very useful for different purposes such as cyber threat intelligence, detecting and preventing cyber attacks and online harms on OSNs, and evaluating the effectiveness of cyber security awareness activities on OSNs. In this paper, we report our work on developing several machine learning based classifiers for detecting cyber security related accounts on Twitter, including a base-line classifier for detecting cyber security related accounts in general, and three sub-classifiers for detecting three subsets of cyber security related accounts (individuals, hackers, and academia). To train and test the classifiers, we followed a more systemic approach (based on a cyber security taxonomy, real-time sampling of tweets, and crowdsourcing) to construct a dataset of cyber security related accounts with multiple tags assigned to each account. For each classifier, we considered a richer set of features than those used in past studies. Among five machine learning models tested, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance: 93% for the baseline classifier, 88-91% for the three sub-classifiers. We also studied feature reduction of the base-line classifier and showed that using just six features we can already achieve the same performance. classification. crowdsourcing. cyber security. cyber threat intelligence. machine learning. online social network. open source intelligence.

Assessment of national cybersecurity capacity for countries in a transitional phase: The spring land case study.Cybersecurity capacity building has emerged as a notable matter for numerous jurisdictions. Cyber-related threats are posing an ever-greater risk to national security for all countries, irrespective of whether they are developed or in the midst of transitioning. This paper presents the results of two qualitative studies using the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CCMM) for nations: (1) Interactive Management (IM) and (2) focus groups to analyse the current state of Spring Land's cybersecurity capacity. A total of 26 participants from government agencies and five national experts from the Spring Land National Cybersecurity Authority (NCSA) contributed to this study. The results show that Spring Land has many issues such as lack of cybersecurity culture and collaborative road-map across government sectors which results in instability within the country. The assessments feed into the requirement analysis of the National Cybersecurity Capacity Building Framework that can be utilised to organise and test the cybersecurity for nations.

Blessed Are The Lawyers, For They Shall Inherit Cybersecurity. This paper considers which types of evidence guide cybersecurity decisions. We argue that the  InfoSec belongs to the quants paradigm will not be realised despite its normative appeal. In terms of progress to date, we find few empirical results that can guide risk mitigation decisions. We suggest the knowledge base about quantitative cybersecurity is continually eroded by increasing complexity, technological flux, and strategic adversaries. Given these secular forces will not abate any time soon, we argue that legal reasoning will increasingly influence cybersecurity decisions relative to technical and quantitative reasoning. The law as a system of social control bristles with ambiguity and so legal mechanisms exist to resolve uncertainties over time. Actors with greater claims to authority over this knowledge base, predominantly lawyers, will accrue decision making power within organisations. We speculate about the downstream impacts of lawyers inheriting cybersecurity, and also sketch the limits of the paradigm's explanatory power. cybersecurity policy. lawyers. philosophy of security. quantitative cybersecurity. risk management. technology policy 
Shame in Cyber Security: Effective Behavior Modification Tool or Counterproductive Foil?. Organizations often respond to cyber security breaches by blaming and shaming the employees who were involved. There is an intuitive natural justice to using such strategies in the belief that the need to avoid repeated shaming occurrences will encourage them to exercise more care. However, psychology highlights significant short- and long-term impacts and harmful consequences of felt shame. To explore and investigate this in the cyber domain, we asked those who had inadvertently triggered an adverse cyber security incident to tell us about their responses and to recount the emotions they experienced when this occurred. We also examined the impact of the organization's management of the incident on the  culprit's future behaviors and attitudes. We discovered that those who had caused a cyber security incident often felt guilt and shame, and their employers' responses either exacerbated or ameliorated these negative emotions. In the case of the former, there were enduring unfavorable consequences, both in terms of employee well-being and damaged relationships. We conclude with a set of recommendations for employers, in terms of responding to adverse cyber security incidents. The aim is to ensure that negative emotions, such as shame, do not make the incident much more damaging than it needs to be. consequences. cyber security incident. guilt. responses. Shame 
COLBAC: Shifting Cybersecurity from Hierarchical to Horizontal Designs.Cybersecurity suffers from an oversaturation of centralized, hierarchical systems and a lack of exploration in the area of horizontal security, or security techniques and technologies which utilize democratic participation for security decision-making. Because of this, many horizontally governed organizations such as activist groups, worker cooperatives, trade unions, not-for-profit associations, and others are not represented in current cybersecurity solutions, and are forced to adopt hierarchical solutions to cybersecurity problems. This causes power dynamic mismatches that lead to cybersecurity and organizational operations failures. In this work we introduce COLBAC, a collective based access control system aimed at addressing this lack. COLBAC uses democratically authorized capability tokens to express access control policies. It allows for a flexible and dynamic degree of horizontality to meet the needs of different horizontally governed organizations. After introducing COLBAC, we finish with a discussion on future work needed to realize more horizontal security techniques, tools, and technologies. access control. activism. authorization. democracy. distributed systems. horizontality. participation. participatory design. security 
Beyond NVD: Cybersecurity meets the Semantic Web..Cybersecurity experts rely on the knowledge stored in databases like the NVD to do their work, but these are not the only sources of information about threats and vulnerabilities. Much of that information flows through social media channels. In this paper we argue that security experts and general users alike can benefit from the technologies of the Semantic Web, merging heterogeneous sources of knowledge in an ontological representation. We present a system that has an ontology of vulnerabilities at its core, but that is enhanced with NLP tools to identify cybersecurity-related information in social media and to launch queries over heterogeneous data sources. The transformative power of Semantic Web technologies for cybersecurity, which has been proven in the biomedical field, is evaluated and discussed. cybersecurity. neural networks. nlp. ontology. social media 
(CSM2-RA-R2-TI): Cyber security maturity model for risk assessment using risk register for threat intelligence. Because of the growing frequency sophistication, and severity of cyber security attacks, all businesses should ensure that cyber security risk is properly addressed in their enterprise risk management (ERM) programs. Risk Management, agreeing with the NIST Guide 8286 is the arrangement of  composed exercises to direct and control an association concerning risk . NISTIR 8286 characterizes a system and framework for hazard the executives. In any case, executing this norm without an in-depth plan can turn into a risk on associations. This paper provides a capability maturity model for risk assessment for threat intelligence using a risk register. This model helps the organization as reference and set clear path to survey risk assessments in accordance with latest threats. Maturity model. NISTIR 8286. Risk management. Risk register.

Understanding Learners' Interests in Cybersecurity Competitions on Reddit.Cybersecurity competitions have been recognized as an effective approach to engaging students with real-world challenges. This work aims to explore the cybersecurity competition contestants' interests and opinions by collecting and analyzing Reddit data. Reddit is a leading hub for students and professionals to exchange information and share experience. We identified a list of keywords of interest and gathered over three thousand relevant public posts. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis methods are employed to gain insight into learners' interests and opinions from the data. Our results of analyzing Reddit posts provide a complementary understanding of learners' interests and opinions compared with the existing survey studies of cybersecurity competitions. The frequency analysis results show that the popular topics include training tools, career advice, penetration testing, CTF, and certifications. Although survey studies are more targeted, our analysis of Reddit posts provides a more complete picture of how learners' sentiment is impacted by competitions. In the end, our analysis results enable us to discuss several practical implications of the findings and directions of future work. Content Analysis. Cybersecurity Competitions. Reddit. Text Mining

Nudge or restraint: How do people assess nudging in cybersecurity - A representative study in germany.While nudging is a long-established instrument in many contexts, it has more recently emerged to be relevant in cybersecurity as well. For instance, existing research suggests nudges for stronger passwords or safe WiFi connections. However, those nudges are often not as effective as desired. To improve their effectiveness, it is crucial to understand how people assess nudges in cybersecurity, to address potential fears and resulting reactance and to facilitate voluntary compliance. In other contexts, such as the health sector, studies have already thoroughly explored the attitude towards nudging. To address that matter in cybersecurity, we conducted a representative study in Germany (N = 1, 012), asking people about their attitude towards nudging in that specific context. Our findings reveal that 64% rated nudging in cybersecurity as helpful, however several participants expected risks such as intentional misguidance, manipulation and data exposure as well.

Understanding young people's experiences of cybersecurity.Young people are increasingly becoming responsible for the security of their devices, yet do not appear to have the knowledge to protect themselves online. In this paper, we explore young people's knowledge of cybersecurity through a series of workshops with secondary school children, and co-design cybersecurity lessons aimed at engaging this demographic. We find that technical demonstrations are an effective way of engaging young people's curiosity in the subject, and that group activities aimed at exploring the subject are preferred methods. We also find that while knowledgeable about cybersecurity theory (e.g. passwords), their actual behaviours did not reflect best practice. We discuss the role of schools in cybersecurity education and how to best embed this content in the curriculum to maximise the engagement of students, including a focus on teaching about cybersecurity protective tools.

Plug-and-play: Framework for remote experimentation in cyber security.Remote experiments with human participants play an important role across multiple fields of studies, from medical science to engineering, as they allow for better representation of human participants and more realistic experimental environments, and ensure research continuity in exceptional circumstances, such as nationwide lockdowns. Yet cyber security has few standards for conducting experiments with human participants, let alone in a remote setting. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework for remote experimentation in cyber security. This framework systematises design and deployment practices while preserving realistic, reproducible data collection and the safety and privacy of participants. We evaluate our framework using a case study involving Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices deployed at remote locations and analyse the experience from the perspectives of both the researchers and the participants.

Strategies for Integrating Two-Year Information Technology and Cybersecurity Programs.To meet the high demand for trained Cybersecurity professionals, many two-year colleges which have been offering degree programs in Information Technology (IT) are expanding or revising their course offerings to include Cybersecurity courses. The increasing importance of Cybersecurity skills has led to an increase in Cybersecurity requirements for IT majors. Due to considerations related to competency overlap, vendor-based academy content, government designations, faculty qualifications, general education requirements, enrollment capacity, and other factors, two-year colleges are evaluating various options for how to effectively offer both IT and Cybersecurity content. Options include separate IT and Cybersecurity degrees, IT and Cybersecurity concentrations using a common core of general Computing courses, and multiple IT degree concentrations based on a common IT core. Colleges should evaluate the competencies expected of completers to determine how to best structure their programs. community college. cybersecurity. information technology. information technology education.. program integration. transfer programs. two-year college. two-year programs 
UCLP: A Novel UAV Cybersecurity Laboratory Platform.Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their applications in various fields. At the same time, the utilization of UAVs also raises serious security and safety concerns. Given a large number of UAV-related jobs to be created in the near future, it is pressing to educate and train current and next-generation cybersecurity professionals towards UAVs and their applications. However, there is a lack of education and training materials on UAV cybersecurity, especially for hands-on practice. In this paper, we propose a novel UAV cybersecurity laboratory platform (UCLP), which provides efficient and effective hands-on practice. UCLP offers not only a cost-effective UAV cybersecurity practice environment, but also a series of designed and pre-configured lab modules. UCLP adopts a plug-in based design and hence supporting flexible customization of existing and new lab modules. UCLP uses technical solutions to overcome non-technical limitations in UAV cybersecurity practice (e.g., regulations of UAV operations). Our evaluation results demonstrated the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of UCLP and indicated UCLP is promising to be integrated into the education and training of UAV, cybersecurity, and related fields. instructional operating system. laboratory. security. uav

The proposed computing system can be used as part of a decision support system for assessing cybersecurity risks of information systems of critical infrastructure facilities. The results obtained can be used to assess the cybersecurity risk of information systems of critical infrastructure objects in the construction and implementation of information security management systems, integrated information protection systems in automated systems in the development of a threat model, security policy, and protection plan. Despite a significant number of approaches to solving this problem, it remains relevant for the entire world community. complex risk model. objective risk. risk. subjective risk. vector risk model 
Experimental Cybersecurity Level Determination in the Civil Aviation Critical Infrastructure.Critical information infrastructure protection is a complex process, which requires effective tools for entities' identification, criticality estimation, threat and vulnerability assessment, as well as security ensuring against threats and determining the cybersecurity level. The conducted analysis has shown that today there is no complex, multifunctional method which helps to evaluate the cybersecurity level of the critical information infrastructure entity or a certain industry of the state. From this viewpoint, in the paper advantages and disadvantages of the known approaches were defined. The authors have previously developed a method for determination the level of cybersecurity in critical information infrastructure of the state. This study was continued by experiments, which tested the adequacy of the method's response to changes in input data. In addition, a special software application was developed and implemented and the developed method was verified. It is proved, that the developed method and software make it possible to calculate quantitative parameters that characterize the security of the analyzed industry, to compare the level of critical object security before and after the security mechanisms implementation.

Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) of honeypot-based cybersecurity experiment for IoT.Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is the process of identifying potential failure modes, their causes and effects associated with a product, process or system. In this paper, we discuss the application of FMEA in the design of cybersecurity experiments using a medium interaction server honeypot in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Through FMEA analysis, we identify the factors affecting the outcome or contributing to the potential failures of the cybersecurity experiment. We discuss the causes of failures, their effects and how to minimise or mitigate them. Cybersecurity experiments. FMEA. Honeypot. IoT 
Artificial Intelligence Based Predictive Threat Hunting in the Field of Cyber Security.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that focuses on designing smart machines capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Despite the fact that security solutions are growing progressively modern and stable, cyberattacks are still evolving and are at their extreme. The main reason is that conventional methods of malware detection fail. Cyber attackers are actively developing new ways to prevent defence programmes from infecting malware networks and servers. Most anti-malware and antivirus applications currently use signature-based detection to identify attacks, which is unsuccessful in detecting new threats. This is where Artificial Intelligence is most handy. The standardised models for threatened hunting and performance quantification from the start of hazard hunting to the end still allow methodological rigour and completeness to be studied remain undefined. The organised practise of hazard hunts seeks to disclose the presence of TTP in the field of detection that has not already been detected. In this study, a realistic and comprehensive model is outlined to detect attackers in six stages: aim, scale, equipment, planning, execution and input. This study describes Threat Hunting in an ecosystem as the constructive, analyst-driven scanning mechanism for attackers TTP. The model has been checked for real-world data sets using a variety of threats. The effectiveness and practicality of this research have been shown with and without a blueprint through danger hunts. In addition, the article presents an analysis of the concept of threat hunting based on data from Ukrainian electricity grid attacks in an online environment to highlight the effects of this model on threat hunting in a simulated environment. The findings of this analysis include an effective and repetitive way to search for and quantify honesty, coverage and rigour. Joint Targetting Cycle. Threa tHunting Model. Threathunting 
A Model Predictive Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles Cybersecurity.Nowadays, many vehicles are connected to the Internet for providing enhanced or additional functionalities to drivers. However, the existing vehicle communication protocols are not designed for cybersecurity. As a result, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are exposed to hacker attacks which could jeopardize the safety of passengers. In this paper, a novel Informative Model Predictive Scheme (I-MPS) against Replay Attacks (RAs) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for AVs is proposed. The effectiveness of the scheme is shown by numerical simulations of an autonomous vehicles during an overtaking and is compared against a typical architecture not implementing the I-MPS.
Defense against DoS and load altering attacks via model-free control: A proposal for a new cybersecurity setting.Defense against cyberattacks is an emerging topic related to fault-tolerant control. In order to avoid difficult mathematical modeling, model-free control (MFC) is suggested as an alternative to classical control. For illustration purpose a Load Frequency Control of multi-areas power network is considered. In the simulations, load altering attacks and Denial of Service (DoS) in the communication network are applied to the system. Our aim is to compare the impact of cyberattacks on control loops closed via respectively a classical controller in such situations and a model-free one.

Cyber Security Issue in Smart Grid.Smart Grid is an iteration of power grid that merges Information Technology (IT) with Operational Technology (OT). It is more efficient, reliable and economical as compared to the conventional power grid. It also supports renewable energy and enhances power generation, transmission and distribution. Due to extensive use of communication and computer networks, there are inborn challenges of Cyber Security in Smart Grid. For an efficient energy management, a continuous exchange of data between various subsystems and control centre in a secured manner is required. This massive data exchange is vulnerable to cyber-attacks which can compromise the integrity of the system. There is an evolution in cyber-crime which includes state sponsored cyber terrorism, Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear Plant, Black Energy 3 attack in Ukraine and cyber-attack on Kudankulam Nuclear power plant in India, Night Dragon originated from China. There are incidences of energy theft at consumer level all around the globe which incurs Non-Technical Loss (NTL). Smart meters can be hacked and data can be manipulated easily. Therefore, there is a need for a holistic approach for detecting, neutralizing thwarting the cyber-attacks. This paper explores various types of theft and its detection using NTL. attack on Smart Grid. Cyber security in Smart Grid. non-technical losses. types of theft 
Industrial and consumer internet of things: Cyber security considerations, threat landscape, and countermeasure opportunities.The requirements of industrial, consumer or generic Internet of Things (IoT) networks are evolving due to advances in sensor and wireless networks, embedded systems, edge and cloud computing. IoT is becoming increasingly pervasive in the industrial domain, and these networks face the additional challenge of evolving network architecture towards integrating Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks. This paper analyses the underpinning cybersecurity risks and attack landscape in Industrial IoT (IIoT) and suggests potential countermeasure opportunities for future hybrid IoT applications based on lessons from IIoT projects.

Onboard Cybersecurity Diagnostic System for Connected Vehicles.Today's advanced vehicles have high degree of interaction due to numerous sensors, actuators and also with complex communication within the control units. In order to hack a vehicle, it has to be within a certain range of communication. Here, we discuss the On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) regulations for next generation BEV/HEV, its vulnerabilities and cybersecurity threats that come with hacking. We propose three cybersecurity attack detection and defense methods: Cyber-Attack detection algorithm, Time-Based CAN Intrusion Detection Method and, Feistel Cipher Block Method. These control methods autonomously diagnose a cybersecurity problem in a vehicle's onboard system using an OBD interface, such as OBD-II when a fault caused by a cyberattack is detected, All of this is achieved in an internal communication network structure.

Fuzzy-based Human Factor Centered Cybersecurity Risk Assessment.With the rise of IT systems, cyber-attacks are becoming not only more intense and complex, but also more sophisticated. The source of threats can be multiple, including hardware, software, physical and human factors. Yet, it can be stated that the weakest link is the human element. For this reason the aim of this study to develop a risk assessment model which is able to predict the risk level taking into account the characteristics of the company. In the proposed hierarchical model, fuzzy-based subsystems are used to handle the inherent uncertainties and subjectivity in the data and in the evaluation process. cybersecurity. fuzzy inference. human factor. vulnerability

Influence of Organizational Factors and Forms of Accounting Outsourcing on Enterprise Cybersecurity.Advances in computer communications and shift to a digital economy necessitate the outsourcing of accounting operations, that is delegation of accounting functions to third parties. It is proved that introduction of accounting outsourcing leads to emergence of significant cyber risks to the operation of the economic entity. It is substantiated that when choosing an optimal form of outsourcing, enterprise management should be focused on the organizational features of accounting foremost. The influence of organizational accounting factors on the cybersecurity of the enterprise in the context of outsourcing and its various forms is determined. The methodology for assessing potential cyber risks of accounting outsourcing is developed in terms of delegating accounting functions to a specialized outsourcing firm, an independent accounting expert, an embedded accountant-outstaffer, or a cloud information processing service. The proposals can be used beneficially during the selection of organizational forms of outsourcing in order to ensure enterprise cybersecurity. accounting. accounting outsourcing. cyber risk assessment. cybersecurity of the enterprise. forms of outsourcing. organizational factors of accounting 
Combined Outsourcing of Accounting and Cybersecurity Authorities.The intensification of cyber threats as a result of global hybrid conflicts, the emergence of the digital economy, and pandemic changes in the way employees perform their duties requires the development of effective means of cyber defense of the enterprise. Since the main generator of economic information at the micro level is accounting, accounting information systems need priority cybersecurity. Combined (integrated) outsourcing of accounting and cybersecurity, which helps to optimize the business processes of the enterprise, minimize administrative costs, reduce the likelihood of information and financial risks, has been developed.The information scheme of the combined (mosaic) organizational variant of outsourcing is developed, which lies in combining features of functional and structural variants of outsourcing with mosaic delegation of financial and management accounting and security functions to many different outsourcers. With the help of blockchain technology, disparate accounting information is integrated and transmitted to the accounting and management of the enterprise for further processing. The implementation of the proposed model provides comprehensive outsourcing of financial and management accounting and security functions with an effective system of cybersecurity. accounting automation. accounting outsourcing. combined (mosaic) organizational model of outsourcing. cybersecurity. financial and management accounting. integrated delegation of accounting and security powers 
Model-based Attack Tree Generation for Cybersecurity Risk-Assessments in Automotive.Networked and highly automated driver assistance systems require interfaces to the outside world and within the vehicle. These can potentially be used for cybersecurity attacks. Therefore, cybersecurity risk analyses are essential to adequately counter cybersecurity threats. Through UNECE Regulations No. 155, cybersecurity risk assessments, are mandatory for all new cars from 2024. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard 'Road vehicles Cybersecurity engineering', defines requirements for cybersecurity risk management with regard to electrical/electronic systems and components. In this context, it is imperative that possible attack paths are investigated. The creation of these attack paths is labor-intensive and should relate to the preliminary system architecture. Automatic attack tree generation could help to reduce the effort to create attack paths manually. This paper presents a new approach to generate relevant attack paths in a semi-automated way, taking the attack motivation and functional dependencies into account. This can shift the effort of creating attack trees in the concept phase to the preliminary system description and allows cybersecurity experts to focus more on aspects that require their creativity and expertise.

Understanding parents' perceptions of children's cybersecurity awareness in Norway.Children are increasingly using the internet nowadays. While internet use exposes children to various privacy and security risks, few studies have examined how parents perceive and address their children's cybersecurity risks. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with 25 parents living in Norway with children aged between 10 to 15. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the parents and performed a thematic analysis of the interview data. The results of this paper include a list of cybersecurity awareness needs for children from a parental perspective, a list of learning resources for children, and a list of challenges for parents to ensure cybersecurity at home. Our results are useful for developers and educators in developing cybersecurity solutions for children. Future research should focus on defining cybersecurity theories and practices that contribute to children's and parents' awareness about cybersecurity risks, needs, and solutions. Children, Parents.

Poster: The need for a collaborative approach to cyber security education.Traditional forms of cyber security education mainly focus on knowledge transmission, which means that knowledge is perceived as a tangible object being transferred from an expert (i.e., the teacher) to a beginner. When practiced well, the learner may acquire such knowledge, but not the resilience to apply it in various contexts [1], [2]. This is especially troubling for the cyber security domain, given the dynamic and constantly changing nature of the field and the environments in which it is required. We therefore need forms of education that aim at understanding the interdisciplinary nature of the field of cyber security as well as at the development of joint action in context: being able to quickly analyse and understand evolving and possibly previously unseen situations and take collaborative action to prevent, detect and recover from incidents.

A Model-Driven Methodology for Automotive Cybersecurity Test Case Generation.Through international regulations (most prominently the latest UNECE regulation) and standards, the already widely perceived higher need for cybersecurity in automotive systems has been recognized and will mandate higher efforts for cybersecurity engineering. The UNECE also demands the effectiveness of these engineering to be verified and validated through testing. This requires both a significantly higher rate and more comprehensiveness of cybersecurity testing that is not effectively to cope with using current, predominantly manual, automotive cybersecurity testing techniques. To allow for comprehensive and efficient testing at all stages of the automotive life cycle, including supply chain parts not at hand, and to facilitate efficient third party testing, as well as to test under real-world conditions, also methodologies for testing the cybersecurity of vehicular systems as a black box are necessary. This paper therefore presents a model and attack tree-based approach to (semi-)automate automotive cybersecurity testing, as well as considerations for automatically black box-deriving models for the use in attack modeling.

Cybersecurity Test Range for Autonomous Vehicle Shuttles.Autonomous vehicle (AV) shuttles for public transportation are challenged by a lack of cybersecurity testing and platforms to conduct testing. Real-world, operational vehicles are expensive and operators are reluctant to test cybersecurity test cases that could impart damage to the systems. Furthermore, despite rigorous regression testing methods used within the broader automotive industry, vulnerabilities of automotive systems are still being found by creative edge and corner cases. To enable testing for edge and corner cases for AV shuttles, we propose the integration of cyber-physical test beds and ranges into the testing program of real-world AV shuttles. We evaluated the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) DuckieBot as the basis for comprehensive cybersecurity vulnerability testing and show how the results can be applied to the iseAuto, a real-world AV shuttle operating in Tallinn, Estonia. The MIT DuckieBot test bed is used to replicate the complexity and interactions of relevant systems of the iseAuto AV shuttle. The practical evaluation, involving cybersecurity edge and corner test cases demonstrated that cyber-physical test beds and ranges can support agile, repeatable cybersecurity testing that is low-cost and is conducted in a controlled and safe environment. automotive cybersecurity. autonomous vehicle cyber range. autonomous vehicle shuttles. cybersecurity test bed. cybersecurity testing 
Towards Cybersecurity MOOC Certification.Especially during the COVID-19 crisis, MOOCs have become more important than ever, also for the cybersecurity domain. The certification of cybersecurity MOOCs could help promote quality aspects of MOOCs and enable their quality assessment and comparison. We conducted an online survey to analyse the role of cybersecurity MOOC certification based on proposed quality criteria for cybersecurity MOOCs and for MOOCs in general. Participants reported mixed experiences with MOOCs and largely agreed with our proposed quality criteria. This paper shows that there is a high acceptance and need for certification. Certification.

Ontology-Based Scenario Modeling for Cyber Security Exercise.The growing demand for cyber security professionals with practical knowledge is boosting the development and conduct of cyber security exercises around the world. Scenarios stand a central position of the exercise, which sets the stage for later action by providing contextual information that the participants will need during the exercise. To manage the increasing numbers of scenario creation in the different contexts, we propose an ontology to model scenarios for cyber security exercises. This ontology identifies aspects of scenario modeling relevant to cyber security that can be used as a means to achieve a defined taxonomy of knowledge items and a standard vocabulary for cyber scenarios. With the semantic framework based on RDF/OWL, this ontology provides a common structure at a semantic level that allows scenarios to be shared and reused across applications and community boundaries. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed ontology. cyber security exercise. ontology. scenario modeling 
Success Factors for Designing a Cybersecurity Exercise on the Example of Incident Response.Exercises are a resource intensive form of providing participants learning, capability testing and validation of plans and procedures. As exercises commonly are used in the field of cybersecurity, their effective and optimal organisation is important. This article aims at identifying key exercise organisation assessment indicators, regardless of exercise type or goal, on the example of cyber incident response exercises. Based on practical experience and literature on crisis management, incident response, and cybersecurity exercises, a 10-step exercise organisation process is identified. For each step, criticalities for the designers and other stakeholders of cyber incident response exercises are identified. These criticalities are also translated in a checklist of actionable indicators aimed at supporting them in measuring the quality of the exercise and implementing an exercise organisation learning loop. cybersecurity incident response. evaluation. organising cybersecurity exercises. quality indicators 
Using Cyber Digital Twins for Automated Automotive Cybersecurity Testing.Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical necessity, with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance functions and vehicular communications. These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-The-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-To-zero a priori knowledge. automotive. cybersecurity. digital twin. model-based testing. testing 
Emotional Experiences of Cybersecurity Breach Victims.This study investigated emotional reactions to cybersecurity breaches. Based on prior research, a context-specific instrument was developed. This new instrument covered all five emotion components identified by the componential emotion approach. In total, 145 participants that experienced a cybersecurity breach reported on their appraisals, action tendencies, bodily reactions, expressions, subjective feelings, and regulation attempts. A principal component analysis on a total of 75 emotion reactions revealed a clear three-dimensional structure. The first dimension represented the extent to which the person was generally emotionally affected. The second dimension revealed constructive action tendencies and subjective feelings that were opposed to unconstructive action tendencies, expressions, and bodily reactions. The third dimension revealed cognitive motivational reactions that were opposed to affective reactions. This study clearly indicated that cybersecurity breaches do not only form a challenge for engineers, but also have important psychological ramifications that need to be addressed. Although some people have a tendency to react with constructive and proactive actions that are likely to limit the negative consequences of the cybersecurity breach, others experience a strong negative affective stress reaction and are unlikely to take the appropriate steps to deal with the security breach situation. These people, especially, can be expected to be vulnerable to psychological complaints and possibly psychopathology. The newly developed instrument uses a comprehensive approach to assess emotional reactions to cybersecurity threats and provides an efficient way to identify potentially problematic reactions. componential emotion approach. cybersecurity breach victims. emotion processes 
FPGA-based Design of Multiple Models for Industry 4.0 Cyber Security.Industry 4.0 computing infrastructure depends on traditional processing platforms, and all these platforms perform well and achieving acceptable throughput. Two significant problems confront with these platforms are the delay in data processing and security hazard for potential threats. A design coding has been written using VHDL based on behaviour temporal parallelism for Industry 4.0 cybersecurity model. The models are divided into three namely, single, dual and quad models. Every model has three main components include UART, FIFO and DES algorithm for data encryption and decryption. Encryption is achieved more than one block at a time and over the number of designs to find the most suitable application for data processing. A DES algorithm based efficient implementing the design of 16-round multiple parallel models for low-cost, scalable, and robust encryption solution of a maximum clock frequency of 227MHz and it is capable of encrypting or decrypting data blocks at a rate of throughput 58,288Mbps.
Cyber Security Risks of Technical Components in Industry 4.0.Industry 4.0 is a new concept of automation data exchange in manufacturing. Industry 4.0 consists of various technical components such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, OPC UA, and cloud. There could be cyber risks when these technical components are used in Industrial Control System (ICS) without security consideration. Therefore cyber risk assessment, reconsideration of implementation, operation are necessary to adopt Industry 4.0. Problems of previous research for ICS risk assessments are some of them are theoretical and conceptual methods such as simulations. Moreover, they do not focus on Industry 4.0 components.The objective of this research is to prove the concrete cyber risks and introduces corresponding secure implementations for Industry 4.0 components such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). The proposed method has benefits for clarifying impacts on the real world by cyber-Attacks through penetration tests against ICS testbed with actual machines. AI. cloud. cyber security. ICS testbed.

Structuring a Cybersecurity Curriculum for Non-IT Employees of Micro- And Small Enterprises. Micro- and Small Enterprises (MSE) and the persons working there (owners/managers, employees) are often neglected in policies and initiatives concerning cybersecurity and data privacy. Communication strategies are targeting IT-departments or IT-specialists - most MSEs have neither. The Horizon 2020 project GEIGER wants to address this problem by providing a cybersecurity monitoring solution that can be used by IT-laypersons. In addition to an easy-to-use software tool focusing on the monitoring of imminent cyber threats GEIGER develops an Education Ecosystem, which approaches this target groups at different levels: from regular employees, who cannot or don't want to extensively deal with cybersecurity, to designated persons (internal or external), who are made responsible for monitoring the functioning of GEIGER in a company. To take full account of this, the competence level of individuals and their development are part of the data structure of the GEIGER monitoring. Hence, it also includes automated recommendations to follow certain training sequences included in GEIGER or from other sources. To define the different levels of competence in cybersecurity, i.e. also their development, to propose adequate learning objectives and design pertinent learning materials, GEIGER has elaborated a curriculum. The structure of this curriculum follows the conditions and requirements given by the general situation of security threats and learning scenarios in MSEs. It has three main dimensions: ĝ€levels' that reflect the competence development within MSE-specific learning environments. ĝ€pillars' that reflect the GEIGER-specific topical differentiation in general cybersecurity as well as handling and communicating GEIGER functions. object ĝ€layers' that reflect specific cybersecurity threats as they appear for the IT-lay target groups in MSEs. To allow for interoperability of the educational parts of GEIGER the competences of the GEIGER curriculum are written in form of xAPI-statements, i.e. a specific metadata-format for learning achievements. curriculum development. cybersecurity and data privacy.

The Matter of Cybersecurity Expert Workforce Scarcity in the Czech Republic and Its Alleviation through the Proposed Qualifications Framework.This paper is focused on challenges connected with the persisting imbalance between the supply and demand of the cybersecurity expert workforce. We analyse the current situation in the Czech Republic, finding that although the shortage of experts affects the private and public sectors both, the public sector is constrained by a massive financial undervaluation of cybersecurity experts and other legal and systematic deficiencies and obstacles and therefore has a much lower chance of attracting talents in this field. The inability of public institutions to find relevant workforce causes, among other things, problems with formulating public procurements, assessing offers and communicating their requirements to the supply-side of the labour market. One of the solutions to this crisis might be in the systematic support of education programmes. However, the cybersecurity field is so dynamic and fragmented that the alignment of the education programme with the market needs presents a significant challenge. There, a unified qualifications framework could serve as a basis for finding common ground. We focus on the benefits of creating such a framework, especially the benefits that a united taxonomy can bring to the cybersecurity labour market by bolstering cybersecurity higher education. Finally, we summarise the key features of the cyber-qualifications framework that is being developed under our current project and highlight its potential use for labour market optimisation and efficient development of new cybersecurity study programs and further education.

Cybersecurity Curricula Designer.The paper aims at minimizing the skills gaps and skills shortages on the cybersecurity job market by empowering education and training institutions during the process of creation of new cybersecurity study programs. We provide a complex cybersecurity skills framework based on standardized definitions that helps with the identification of skills and knowledge necessary for cybersecurity work positions. Furthermore, we practically implement the framework in the form of an interactive web application for cybersecurity curricula design. The app, called Curricula Designer, is built upon the framework and allows intuitive design of higher-education curricula and their analysis with respect to requirements of work roles already defined in widely-accepted standards. Using the analytical functions, it is easy to identify missing content in the courses and precisely structure the study program so that the graduates are well-prepared to enter the job market. The Curricula Designer is described in details in this paper, including user interface and technical background, and a link for public free access is provided to serve all education and training institutions. curricula. cybersecurity training. education. skills. study programs. work roles 
Practitioners' Views on Cybersecurity Control Adoption and Effectiveness.Cybersecurity practitioners working in organisations implement risk controls aiming to improve the security of their systems. Determining prioritisation of the deployment of controls and understanding their likely impact on overall cybersecurity posture is challenging, yet without this understanding there is a risk of implementing inefficient or even harmful security practices. There is a critical need to comprehend the value of controls in reducing cyber-risk exposure in various organisational contexts, and the factors affecting their usage. Such information is important for research into cybersecurity risk and defences, for supporting cybersecurity decisions within organisations, and for external parties guiding cybersecurity practice such as standards bodies and cyber-insurance companies. Cybersecurity practitioners possess a wealth of field knowledge in this area, yet there has been little academic work collecting and synthesising their views. In an attempt to highlights trends and a range of wider organisational factors that impact on a control's effectiveness and deployment, we conduct a set of interviews exploring practitioners' perceptions. We compare alignment with the recommendations of security standards and requirements of cyber-insurance policies to validate findings. Although still exploratory, we believe this methodology would help in identifying points of improvement in cybersecurity investment, describing specific potential benefits. Control Effectiveness.

The landscape of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and challenges in healthcare: Security standards and paradigm shift recommendations.Digital technology provides unique opportunities to revolutionize the healthcare ecosystem and health research. However, this comes with serious security, safety, and privacy threats. The healthcare sector has been proven unequipped and unready to face cyberattacks while its vulnerabilities are being systematically exploited by attackers. The growing need and use of medical devices and smart equipment, the complexity of operations and the incompatible systems are leaving healthcare organizations exposed to various malware, including ransomware, which result in compromised healthcare access, quality, safety and care. To fully benefit from the advantages of technology, cybersecurity issues need to be resolved. Cybersecurity measures are being suggested via a number of healthcare standards which are often contradicting and confusing, making these measures ineffective and difficult to implement. To place a solid foundation for the healthcare sector, in improving the understanding of complex cybersecurity issues, this paper explores the existing vulnerabilities in the health care critical information infrastructures which are used in cyberattacks and discusses the reasons why this sector is under attack. Furthermore, the existing security standards in healthcare are presented alongside with their implementation challenges. The paper also discusses the use of living labs as a novel way to discover how to practically implement cybersecurity measures and also provides a set of recommendations as future steps. Finally, to our knowledge this is the first paper that analyses security in the context of living labs and provides suggestions relevant to this context. Cyberattacks. Cybersecurity. Digital Health.

Classifying SMEs for Approaching Cybersecurity Competence and Awareness.Cybersecurity is increasingly a concern for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and there exist many awareness training programs and tools for them. The literature mainly studies SMEs as a unitary type of company and provides one-size-fits-all recommendations and solutions. However, SMEs are not homogeneous. They are diverse with different vulnerabilities, cybersecurity needs, and competencies. Few studies considered such differences in standards and certificates for security tools adoption and cybersecurity tailoring for these SMEs. This study proposes a classification framework with an outline of cybersecurity improvement needs for each class. The framework suggests five SME types based on their characteristics and specific security needs: cybersecurity abandoned SME, unskilled SME, expert-connected SME, capable SME, and cybersecurity provider SME. In addition to describing the five classes, the study explains the framework's usage in sampled SMEs. The framework proposes solutions for each class to approach cybersecurity awareness and competence more consistent with SME needs. capability improvement. classification.

A Threat-Based Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Approach Addressing SME Needs.Cybersecurity incidents are commonplace nowadays, and Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are exceptionally vulnerable targets. The lack of cybersecurity resources available to SMEs implies that they are less capable of dealing with cyber-attacks. Motivation to improve cybersecurity is often low, as the prerequisite knowledge and awareness to drive motivation is generally absent at SMEs. A solution that aims to help SMEs manage their cybersecurity risks should therefore not only offer a correct assessment but should also motivate SME users. From Self-Determination Theory (SDT), we know that by promoting perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness, people can be motivated to take action. In this paper, we explain how a threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment approach can help to address the needs outlined in SDT. We propose such an approach for SMEs and outline the data requirements that facilitate automation. We present a practical application covering various user interfaces, showing how our threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment approach turns SME data into prioritised, actionable recommendations. cybersecurity. motivation. risk assessment.

Examining the Link between Stress Level and Cybersecurity Practices of Hospital Staff in Indonesia.Since healthcare information systems have many important data that can attract many adversaries, it is important to take the right steps to prevent data breaches. Recent studies suggested that 85% of breaches involved a human element and the frequent patterns used are social engineerings. Therefore, many studies focus on making a better understanding of human behavior in cybersecurity and the factors that affect cybersecurity practices. However, there are only a few peer-reviewed studies that focus on the link between stress level and cybersecurity practices. In this study, we examined the link between stress level and cybersecurity practices among hospital employees in Indonesia by surveying 99 hospital workers. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to measure the employees' stress level and a new scale to measure hospital staff's risky cybersecurity practices was proposed. This study showed that both PSS and proposed cybersecurity practices scales are reliable with Cronbach's α value of more than 0.7. The survey results also revealed that hospital worker's higher stress levels correlate significantly with riskier cybersecurity practices (rs = 0.305, p < 0.01). Besides, a higher stress level is also significantly linked to certain cybersecurity practices, such as clicking on a link in an email from an unknown sender, not preventing colleagues from viewing patients' information for a non-therapeutic purpose, posting patient information on social media, ignoring colleagues who engage in negative information security practices, and failing to create strong passwords. behavior. cybersecurity practices. healthcare. hospital staff. stress 
Raising Security Awareness of Cloud Deployments using Infrastructure as Code through CyberSecurity Challenges.Improper deployment of software can have serious consequences, ranging from simple downtime to permanent data loss and data breaches. Infrastructure as Code tools serve to streamline delivery by promising consistency and speed, by abstracting away from the underlying actions. However, this simplicity may distract from architectural or configuration faults, potentially compromising the secure development lifecycle. One way to address this issue involves awareness training. Sifu is a platform that provides education on security through serious games, developed in the industry, for the industry. The presented work extends the Sifu platform with challenges addressing Terraform-aided cloud deployment on Amazon Web Services. This paper proposes an evaluation pipeline behind the challenges, and provides details of the vulnerability detection and feedback mechanisms, as well as a novel technique for detecting undesired differences between a given architecture and a target result. Furthermore, this paper quantifies the challenges' perceived usefulness and impact, by evaluating the challenges among a total of twelve participants. Our preliminary results show that the challenges are suitable for education and the industry, with potential usage in internal training. A key finding is that, although the participants understand the importance of secure coding, their answers indicate that universities leave them unprepared in this area. Finally, our results are compared with related industry works, to extract and provide good practices and advice for practitioners. Awareness. CyberSecurity Challenges. DevSecOps.

SecTULab: A Moodle-Integrated Secure Remote Access Architecture for Cyber Security Laboratories.The Covid-19 crisis has challenged cyber security teaching by creating the need for secure remote access to existing cyber security laboratory infrastructure. In this paper, we present requirements, architecture and key functionalities of a secure remote laboratory access solution that has been instantiated successfully for two existing laboratories at TU Wien. The proposed design prioritizes security and privacy aspects while integrating with existing Moodle eLearning platforms to leverage available authentication and group collaboration features. Performance evaluations of the prototype implementation for real cyber security classes support a first estimate of dimensioning and resources that must be provisioned when implementing the proposed secure remote laboratory access. cyber security teaching. eLearning. remote access laboratories 
PESTLE Analysis of Cybersecurity Education.Cybersecurity is a vital part of digital economies and digital governing but the discipline is suffering from a pronounced skills shortage. Nevertheless, the reasons for the inability of academia to produce enough graduates with the skills that reflect the needs of the cybersecurity industry are not well understood. In this article, we have analysed the skills shortages, gaps, and mismatches affecting cybersecurity education. We performed a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental (PESTLE) analysis, that allowed us to have an overview of the cybersecurity education environment from multiple perspectives. The results of this analysis highlight 31 different factors affecting cybersecurity education on a European level. These factors were further analysed from the specific perspectives of 11 European countries. In this further analysis, particular attention was given to the linkages between the identified factors. This helped to reveal which factors are connected and to describe how they are mutually dependent. A statistical approach was used to depict the results in a more general and comprehensive way and facilitated the development of our conclusions. Our analysis identifies a lack of European coordination and cooperation towards a common cybersecurity framework as one of the main factors affecting cybersecurity education.

5G and beyond telco cloud: Architecture and cybersecurity challenges.The continuous improvements in network softwarization and cloudification have enabled the realization of many applications. One significant result from this is the harmonized amalgamation of NFV, SDN, and Cloud Computing to bring telco clouds that efficiently operate in a 5G network. Although these building blocks have revolutionized the telecom sector in various ways, they are vulnerable to multiple security issues. Moreover, the absence of a generic architecture is another challenge that hinders the effective adoption of the technology. Consequently, in this paper, we have studied the designs proposed by various telco cloud providers and suggested a generic telco cloud architecture to serve as a reference for further study. In addition, we have also summarized vital security threats that can expose telco clouds to numerous attacks. 5G. Cloud. Cybersecurity. NFV. SDN. Telco cloud 
Secure data management using distributed storages for stronger cybersecurity in cloud service.As data used in IT services increases exponentially, cloud storage-based services that normally store user data on the cloud storage which is controlled by cloud storage service providers and restore data only when necessary are being activated. Accordingly, the importance of technique for securing data stored in cloud storage is increasing. In particular, as the importance of data increases, an attack on cloud storage services is considered not as a simple threat to the safety of individual services, but as an attack from the perspective of cybersecurity that can threaten the well-being of society where the stored data is utilized. In this paper, we propose a technique for providing cloud service safety. Specifically, we consider three major requirements for providing information security of data stored in the cloud storage: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In the case of the previously proposed technique, only some of the three major requirements are intensively analyzed and countermeasures are proposed. Since there is a corresponding technique for individual requirements, it is possible to respond to each security requirement by parallelly applying the existing technologies. However, in the case of a system designed with such simple approaches, it is difficult to provide all security requirements by actually grafting it due to the difference in the configuration method of each hypothesis, or even if possible, efficiency impairment occurs. In this paper, we designed a technique that can efficiently meet the three major requirements from this point of view. Cloud service. Cybersecurity. Security. Storage 
A Competence-Based Three-Layer Cybersecurity Education Framework and Its Application.The Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020) competence model raises a big challenge to cybersecurity education in terms of knowledge, skill and disposition. In this paper, we propose a competence-based three-layer cybersecurity education framework using an ensembling learning strategy. Typically, the proposed framework contains the following three parts: core requirements of competence for cybersecurity, a learning ecosystem, and a unified learning platform. After that, we use the framework to reform a course named Network Security. In the case study, we present the implementing details of the proposed framework followed by extensive data analysis and teaching reflections. Statistical results suggest that the proposed framework is powerful to raise the level of learning achievements that are grounded in CC2020 and course learning objectives. competence model. computing curricula 2020.

Cyber security risk analysis for a virtual assistant G2C digital service using FAIR model.During development and deployment of Government-to-Citizen (G2C) e-services, stakeholders must take cybersecurity risks into account. Recently, Estonia proposed a novel e-service delivery through the use of virtual assistants. Cybersecurity is important to any organization due to the prevalence of attacks in recent times. Organizations in both the public sector and private sector typically have a program that determines, calculates and treats risks. These programs are identified as 'risk management,' and cybersecurity risk assessment and analysis are a key part of these organizations. When correctly implemented, these programs can help decision makers allocate their cyber defense budgets in a more effective manner.The researchers conducted interviews with seven cybersecurity experts discussing cybersecurity data, metrics and risk assessment and analysis methods. These interviews informed the use of the Open Group's Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model in this paper.Because Estonia is one of the first countries in the world to prioritize e-service development in this domain, there is a literature gap pertaining to cybersecurity risk analyses of virtual assistant enabled e-services. Although a multiplicity of methods exist for risk assessment and analysis, this research follows the FAIR method to assess a G2C e-service which uses a third party provider for an Amazon Alexa skill that has become corrupted due to malware infection. The FAIR method projects the risk for a particular vulnerability in terms of dollar amount loss over time. It states the annualized loss exposure in terms of a minimum loss, a maximum loss, and a most likely amount of loss.Aggregated global public sector cyber breach frequency data was taken from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database and loss magnitude data was taken from the Cyentia IRIS 2020 report which utilized the Advisen cyber loss database. Based upon a Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distribution Monte Carlo simulation of this data, the annualized loss exposure projection for the public sector entity was $0 minimum likely value, most likely value $70,500 and maximum likely value of $6,000,000. Future work proposes more country and organization specific data for FAIR methodology use for G2C virtual assistant e-services analysis. The value of the work is that it shows how public sector agencies could use the FAIR model to make their cybersecurity risk models more quantitative than is generally currently practiced even in cases of new types of developments and services in order to aid decision-makers in allocation of funding to better defend against the most impactful risks.

A Look into Increasing the Number of Veterans and Former Government Employees Converting to Career and Technical Cybersecurity Teachers.The current state of technology with recent explosions in the digital processing of paperwork, computer networking use, and online and virtual approaches to areas, which until very recently had traditional and non-computerized ways of operating, led to a steady increase in the demand for jobs in the area of computer science and cybersecurity. The education system, the pipeline for the incoming workforce, needs to keep up with this tremendous pace in technology and the job market. The current K-12 school system has been extensively challenged to fill out necessary positions in order to address the increasing need for programs that respond to industry and government entity gaps in employment. The COVID-19 pandemic forced a large segment of the economy to swiftly move to virtual working and virtual learning. This further increased the already large demand for cybersecurity jobs and accelerated the pace at which the development of necessary education pathways is required. The education system, on all different levels, needs to adjust to this pace in order to enable a large number of future graduates to fill these new jobs. There is currently a large gap in the number of K-12 level teachers available in the area of career and technical education. One possible solution to this problem may come from a specific segment of the workforce, veterans. This paper will provide an overview of different challenges that many veterans are facing after joining career switcher programs for future teachers.
The Need for ABET Accreditation of Associate's Cybersecurity Programs.Cybersecurity professionals at all levels of preparation are in high demand, with the need still growing rapidly. In response, community colleges have been offering Associate's programs in cybersecurity for over a decade. The content of such programs has been driven by many factors including the needs of local industry, professional certification requirements for entry-level jobs, and education advancement programs under such organizations as the National Security Agency, the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), the National CyberWatch Center, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). A consequence of this diversity of drivers is wide variation in the types of graduates produced, which is not conducive to developing shared expectations, from prospective students to employers. In addition, as a discipline matures, creating standards for educational programs is a professional responsibility of the academic community, as is establishing accreditation criteria to ensure quality is sustained-enter ABET. This paper summarizes the major efforts that led to Associate's degree programs in cybersecurity, along with the motivation to create the first ABET Associate's Cybersecurity Program Criteria. It discusses the process to develop these cybersecurity criteria, describes the current criteria, and presents the current status of the effort. In essence, this process reflects the maturation of the cybersecurity discipline.
Self-assessment of Knowledge Levels in the Subjects of Cyber Attacks and Defense in a Cybersecurity Awareness Education Workshop.During the past couple of years, an online virtualized student-centric based learning system, Competitive Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS), for cybersecurity education has been developed to prepare students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The system included ten identical learning environments that allowed for interaction among each environment, which made the learning system as a whole more like a realistic network environment. The system could be used in any cybersecurity related undergraduate and graduate courses. It would help students understand the latest cybersecurity technologies. Furthermore, it would provide on-campus and distance education students with opportunities to learn and practice cyberattack and cyber defense techniques used in the real world. In order to maximize the positive impact of the system on cybersecurity education, a two-day workshop was held at East Carolina University (ECU) in the summer of 2019. The workshop was hosted by the Department of Technology Systems (TSYS) and executed in a train-the-trainer format. Nineteen college instructors from Southeast United States attended the workshop and participated in an exit survey. The survey included a set of categories each containing questions to evaluate the workshop design and whether the participants thought the system would be suitable and helpful to students' learning cybersecurity. Based on the survey outcomes, the development team could then make proper adjustments to improve the effectiveness of the system. In this paper, the design of the workshop was described. In addition, the paper discussed the survey results and focused on the self-assessment of knowledge in the subjects of cybersecurity category. Cyber defense. Cyberattack. Cybersecurity.

Integrating Cybersecurity Concepts Across Undergraduate Computer Science and Information Systems Curriculum.The global Cybersecurity skill gap in 2020 is about 3.1 million and the Cybersecurity staff shortage is about 69%. Universities are waking up to the need for developing skills in Cybersecurity. Though many Universities offer a master's degree in Cybersecurity, it is impractical to fill this huge demand for Cybersecurity through only graduate degree holders. After careful analysis, it has become evident that there is a gap in the curriculum as it relates to training for Cybersecurity concepts in foundational computing courses for students. To be more specific, there is relatively less focus on the infusion of Cybersecurity concepts in undergraduate computing courses and its impact on classroom practices. This paper serves to address this gap by providing an experience in infusing, teaching, and assessing Cybersecurity modules in various undergraduate computing courses that immerse students in real-world Cybersecurity practices through active learning.
Hands-On Cybersecurity Curriculum using a Modular Training Kit.There is an exponential growth in the number of cyber-attack incidents resulting in significant financial loss and national security concerns. Secure cyberspace has been designated as one of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges in engineering. Broadly, the security threats are targeted on software programs, operating system and network with the intention to launch confidentiality, integrity and availability violations. Existing undergraduate and graduate-level cybersecurity education curriculum rely primarily on didactic teaching methods with little focus on student centered, inquiry-based teaching, known to improve student learning. With growing number of security incidents taking place, it is of utmost importance to prepare a workforce equipped with knowledge of the threat space and existing state-of-the-art solutions. Such comprehensive understanding is only possible by a dedicated hands-on course on cybersecurity where students can learn the key concepts by editing the hardware, software and OS, and, network policies. Unfortunately, such extensive and deep flexibilities are not provided in current cybersecurity curriculum. In this paper, we introduce a hands-on and modular self-learning Cybersecurity Training (CST) Kit to advance cybersecurity education. Students can promptly apply newly acquired knowledge on the CST Kit as part of the learning process. This Kit accompanies Do-It-Yourself (DIY) training modules that is used to model and investigate cybersecurity issues and their prevention to all levels of the cybersecurity workforce, including undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 science and technology teachers. The Kit also covers various aspects of cybersecurity issues including, hardware, software, operating system and network security. A coursework has been developed on hardware security for senior undergraduate and graduate students using the Kit. A preliminary survey conducted among students who were introduced to the modular board to implement hardware security threats such as, side-channel attack shows an 120% improvement in their understanding after the CST Kit based activities. The components of the CST Kit have also been used in a 4-day summer workshop for K-12 teachers. Teachers took pre- and post- concept inventories to assess their learning of content throughout the workshop and the results indicated improvement of 58%. These assessments focused on vulnerabilities and specific types of attacks, system security, data transmission and encryption, permutations and combinatorics, and binary numbers.
Computer Science Technology-Cyber Security Option. With the growing interest in cybersecurity and lack of institutions with a degree program in the discipline in our region. designing, promoting and implementing a degree program in an institution that traditionally attracts students from the minority population will represent a viable pathway to increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in this emerging industry. After an extensive search we could not identify any Minority Serving Institution (MSI) that offers a degree program in Cybersecurity in our region. This paper will describe how the Cybersecurity program can contribute to the production of these vitally needed scientists, by increasing the number of underrepresented minorities and women with a degree in Cybersecurity. The department of Engineering Technology currently offers an undergraduate degree inComputer Science Technology (CST). The CST curriculum is a hybrid of software and hardwarecourses designed to prepare graduates with a strong background in computer and information systems. This unique program would provide a good base for an academic program that addresses the Cybersecurity problem. This paper will present a project, which will design and implement a cybersecurity degree option in its CST program for students who wish to concentrateand develop strong skills in cybercrime detection, disruption and defenses. This paper will discuss the Curriculum grid showing the educational goals and the requirements for a baccalaureate (BS) degree in Cybersecurity designed and published in the University catalogue. This curriculum will include both currently existing courses (including hardware courses) and the newly developed courses. The development of Cybersecurity program is funded by the Department of Education.
Designing a Creative Cybersecurity Microcredential for Educators: Challenges and Successes of K-12 Teacher Professional Development.Developing foundational cybersecurity knowledge within our society is a critical need for our well-being and protection. At present, there is a dearth of access to fundamental cybersecurity knowledge within student and educator populations. This study can inform engineering educators through professional development with its use of design thinking strategies and be used as a model. With this concept in mind, this study focuses on the impact of a short-term (few week) cybersecurity micro-credential for K-12 teachers that included resources that aligned to the needs of their students. Over the of two iterations of this micro-credential study, the authors sought to answer the research question, What are the micro-credential cybersecurity successes and challenges identified by the participants based on design thinking framework? A total of 21 K-12 teacher participants engaged with two micro-credential experiences. The micro-credential includes unplugged activities via cybercards, essential vocabularies, and online research-backed resources and focused on an introduction to cybersecurity, the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Accessibility), Abstraction, Modularity, and Least Privilege. This study utilized a mixed-methods approach. Qualitative data included observational field notes, bi-weekly progress reports, researcher interviews of 13 K-12 teachers, and notes from a focus group meeting with the K-12 teacher participants. The semi-structured interview questions focus groups notes, and bi-weekly progress reports were coded and grouped into major themes. Additionally, quantitative data including sub-scale concerns were obtained from the attitude survey responses. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, the authors isolated specific successes and challenges experienced by K-12 teachers during their engagement with the pilot microcredentials. Findings include a positive impact on the concerns about computer science between pre-test, post-test, and secondary post-test scores. Additionally, there is a relationship between specific micro-credential materials and teacher's self-confidence at integrating cybersecurity concepts within their own K-12 classroom. The limitations are included. The study showcases innovative and practical tools for teaching cybersecurity, and has implications for teacher educators, technology educators, and those that work in local, state, national educator spaces, and those creating and implementing professional development.
A Call to Create an Open-source Project Initiative for Cybersecurity Virtual Labs.Cybersecurity classes present challenging problems to engineering and computer science departments. Having to negotiate with overstretched IT departments to set up specialized labs to support the curriculum and purchasing third-party cyber labs are not an option for many departments due to reduced budgets. Setting up environments is often left to the instructor after finding difficulties with the limited IT support/or lack of support. Instructors having to create labs is a problematic option since it is a very time-consuming overhead added to the regular activities involved in teaching a curriculum. COVID-19 has recently compounded this problem due to universities having to restrict access to labs. Creating virtual labs for cybersecurity classes has been given attention in the last few years, and ASEE has published papers on the topic [1- 4]. Some universities are creating labs, while others are using the NSF-funded SEED Labs Project. [5-7]. The authors are proposing an opensource project initiative that allows universities, students, and others to contribute their lab work to a public repository hosted by an entity like GitHub. The work can be shared globally without costs or dependence on funding. This presentation is divided into two parts. First, the success of developing hands-on virtual labs and their importance for cybersecurity classes is described. Second, the opensource initiative in greater detail is discussed outlining what was developed, and the authors call on universities to pilot our framework and invite interested parties to contribute to an opensource collaborative infrastructure platform currently under construction. The authors believe the success of this project has great potential for community colleges and universities.
Development of a Laboratory Platform for UAV Cybersecurity Education.In this paper, we propose to develop an educational UAV cybersecurity laboratory platform with a hands-on exercise module to solve the teaching resource limitation and enable related educational activities. In general, our platform will support both SITL and HITL for different drone models with the joint simulation of drones and networks to evaluate the effect of cybersecurity events. Based on the implemented platform, the UAV cybersecurity curriculum materials will be leveraged to design hands-on exercises for UAV training and cybersecurity education. To verify the effectiveness of our implementation, the implemented modules will be evaluated with testing facilities and adjusted according to the feedback of the tests.
Engaging Underrepresented Students in Cybersecurity using Capture-the-Flag(CTF) Competitions (Experience).To increase the participation of minority students, particularly African Americans, in cyber fields, STEM engineering education requires a new approach to student learning. Students learn best when they are actively involved in the learning process. The concept of gamification is an emerging alternative approach that adds game elements to traditional instruction, engaging students in learning engineering concepts. In recent years, capture-the-flag competitions is a gamification approach to train and build students' interest in cybersecurity. During the Spring 2020 academic term, a team of students from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Morgan State University participated in an embedded capture-the-flag (eCTF) organized by MITRE. The eCTF was also offered as a graduate course. This graduate course included a cohort of minority students who had been exposed to fundamental concepts regarding secure embedded systems. We found that the eCTF allowed students to work in teams, develop critical thinking skills, address complex technical issues associated with real-world applications, and motivate continued learning, and increased research productivity after the course ended. This paper aims to describe the design and implementation of the eCTF competition in the graduate course and summarize the successes as well as the barriers that impact the engagement of minority students in cybersecurity.

Work in Progress: Developing Undergraduate Research Experiences in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Cybersecurity.During the fall 2020 semester, nine students were recruited to participate in a UAS cybersecurity-focused undergraduate research experience. Three faculty members each identified a small topic area for undergraduate students to pursue. The three areas are: 1. Small UAS (sUAS) Vulnerability and Threat Assessment and Mitigation 2. Effects of Cyber Attacks on Communication in UAS Swarms with Distributed Swarm Control 3. Enhancing Security of Cloud-Connected UAS Services Students were placed onto teams based on their prior course experiences and the project requirements. Common resources were provided for all students to train them in conducting research. Teams were then tasked with developing a more comprehensive research plan for their specific project and carrying out that plan throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. Students completed a pre-survey at the start of the project and a mid-project survey shortly after the winter break. The surveys combined project specific skills questions as well as relevant questions from the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA), an NSF-funded assessment tool to measure student gains in research skills. This work-in-progress paper will describe the broader project, the individual student team projects, the research training materials, and some of the results from the pre- and mid-project surveys. Additional discussion will be had regarding the COVID-related precautions implemented by both the institution and the project teams. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example approach for future undergraduate research programs looking for practical approaches to implementing undergraduate research programs, particularly those in the cybersecurity area.
Act proactively: An intrusion prediction approach for cyber security.Despite the multitude of approaches proposed for intrusion detection, cyberattacks are still a timeless issue for the research community and industry as they cause various devastating effects to companies and organisations. There are limited intrusion prediction approaches in the literature, as the main bulk of methods focuses on cyberattack detection rather than prediction, which would allow the defenders (attack's targets) to restrain/stop the attack. This work aims to identify known DoS and Probe attack patterns at their very beginning. Specifically, we use machine learning algorithms to predict the malicious packets of DoS and Probe attacks, raising the defender's awareness to act proactively and stop the attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that time series analysis and machine learning techniques are used to model the intrusion prediction problem effectively. An extensive experimental study confirms the efficacy of the proposed approach according to multiple evaluation measures. Intrusion detection. Machine learning. Time series analysis 
Cyber-range federation and cyber-security games: A gamification scoring model.Professional training is essential for organizations to successfully defend their assets against cyber-attacks. Successful detection and prevention of security incidents demands that personnel is not just aware about the potential threats, but its security expertise goes far beyond the necessary background knowledge. To fill-in the gap for competent security professionals, platforms offering realistic training environments and scenarios are designed that are referred to as cyber-ranges. Multiple cyber-ranges listed under a common platform can simulate more complex environments, referred as cyber-range federations. Security education approaches often implement gamification mechanics to increase trainees' engagement and maximize the outcome of the training process. Scoring is an integral part of a gamification scheme, allowing both the trainee and the trainer to monitor the former's performance and progress. In this article, a novel scoring model is presented that is designed to be agnostic with respect to the source of information: either a CR or a variety of different CRs being part of a federated environment.

Cyber security certification programmes.Although a large and fast-growing workforce for qualified cybersecurity professionals exists, developing a cybersecurity certification framework has to overcome many challenges. Towards this end, an extended review of the cybersecurity certifications offered currently on the market from 9 major issuing companies is conducted. Moreover, the guidelines for the definition of a cybersecurity certification framework as they are provided from the recent Cyber Security Act and framework of ENISA, NIST and ISO/IEC 17024 are covered. A vast comparison among the presented cybersecurity certifications is given, based not only on the cybersecurity domain covered but also the required level of candidate's experience. A proposed certification program has been also analyzed based on the learning pathways and the knowledge areas described in FORESIGHT. Certification frameworks. Certifications. Cybersecurity.

The SPIDER cyber security investment component (CIC).Recent security incidents worldwide demonstrate the increase in the complexity and severity of cyber security threats. The attackers become better organized and the attack vectors are using more advanced methods and tools. Therefore, within the currently evolving and complex 5G cyber security landscape, both businesses and end-users need to find ways to enhance their cyber security preparedness level in order to safeguard their infrastructures and assets. Additionally, modern organizations need to invest in cyber security technologies to proactively address the identified cyber risks, based on the specific individual characteristics of their infrastructures. For this reason, investing in cyber security constitutes nowadays an essential financial and operational decision aiming to reduce the financial risk that successful cyber-attacks entail. In this paper, we demonstrate how capital budgeting techniques for gauging the financial risk of cyber attacks may be integrated within an optimisation model for optimal selection of mitigation measures into a single unified decision-making framework.

Advancing the state of maritime cybersecurity guidelines to improve the resilience of the maritime transportation system.Generally, cybersecurity guidelines are geared to take on an integral role in providing industries with a suitable and comprehensive set of standards to inform and direct the design and implementation of their (critical) information technology infrastructure as well as support and govern their operational decisions in order to enhance their cybersecurity posture and resilience. However, in this paper we show that current maritime cybersecurity guidelines have two main shortcomings in that they neither provide a set of holistic recommendations to the key stakeholders in the maritime transportation system nor are the current guidelines sufficiently grounded in research. Thus, as a second contribution in this paper, we propose a comprehensive outline aimed to allow the stakeholders to develop comprehensive and thus more effective cybersecurity guidelines for the maritime transportation system.

Real-time, simulation-based identification of cyber-security attacks of industrial plants.This paper considers the problem of cyber attacks onto industrial plants and proposes to use a digital twin to detect and localize such attacks. The digital twin consists of a representation of the nominal plant behavior, i.e., not under attack, for which differential-algebraic equation systems or discrete state models may be used. By simulating the nominal behavior of the system online, i.e., in parallel to the process, and continuously comparing the simulated behavior to the measured values allows to detect attacks. Their localization is facilitated through a root-cause analysis, which is also based on the model description of the plant. The concept has been implemented and tested on a small scale industrial prototype. Digital twin. Industrial plant. Root cause analysis. Simulation 
Automated and on-demand cybersecurity certification.The digital world nowadays consists of a very high number of devices and software services that are being used and constantly exposed to the Internet. Furthermore, with the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), the cybersecurity threat landscape has overall increased. Consequently, various certification frameworks have been developed for maintaining the overall security posture and supporting the required security tests. This paper describes an approach for conducting automated and on-demand cybersecurity certification on systems and software components. Taking the existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidelines into consideration, the developed software/service component aims to provide auditing information and insights from the systems-on-the-test, to certify newly entering components that could increase the security risk. The recommended approach can be used for collecting, extracting, and generating reports regarding the security aspects of the submitted digital assets by deploying automated security tests and auditing processes that will contribute to the certification process.

Open source and commercial capture the flag cyber security learning platforms - A case study.The use of gamified learning platforms as a method of introducing cyber security education, training and awareness has risen greatly. With this rise, the availability of platforms to create, host or otherwise provide the challenges that make up the foundation of this education has also increased. In order to identify the best of these platforms, we need a method to compare their feature sets. In this paper, we compare related work on identifying the best platforms for a gamified cyber security learning platform as well as contemporary literature that describes the most needed feature sets for an ideal platform. We then use this to develop a metric for comparing these platforms, before then applying this metric to popular current platforms. Capture the Flag Competitions. Cyber Security.

Cyber-security training evaluation metrics.Cyber-security training has evolved into an imperative need, aiming to provide cyber-security professionals with the knowledge and skills required to confront cyber-attacks that are increasing in number and sophistication. Training activities are typically associated with evaluation means, aimed to assess the extent to which the trainee has acquired the knowledge and skills whose development is targeted by the training programme, while cyber-security awareness and skill level evaluation means may be used to support additional security-related aspects of organizations. In this paper, we review trainee performance assessment metrics in cyber-security training, aiming to assist designers of cyber-security training activities to identify the most prominent trainee performance assessment means for their training programmes, while additional research directions involving cyber-security training evaluation metrics are also identified.

SoK: Autonomic cybersecurity - Securing future disruptive technologies.This paper is a systemization of knowledge of autonomic cybersecurity. Disruptive technologies, such as IoT, AI and autonomous systems, are becoming more prevalent and often have little or no cybersecurity protections. This lack of security is contributing to the expanding cybersecurity attack surface. The autonomic computing initiative was started to address the complexity of administering complex computing systems by making them self-managing. Autonomic systems contain attributes to address cyberattacks, such as self-protecting and self-healing that can secure new technologies. There has been a number of research projects on autonomic cybersecurity, with different approaches and target technologies, many of them disruptive. This paper reviews autonomic computing, analyzes research on autonomic cybersecurity, and provides a systemization of knowledge of the research. The paper concludes with identification of gaps in autonomic cybersecurity for future research. Autonomic Computing. Cybersecurity. Disruptive Technology 
Cybersecurity in the Quantum Era-A Study of Perceived Risks in Conventional Cryptography and Discussion on Post Quantum Methods.Information security in communication networks is a persistent problem and essentially requires the usage of encryption methods. Quantum computing was first used to break encryption codes in the latter half of the 20th century with the introduction of the SHOR algorithm. Though the recent developments in QC capabilities have increased confidentiality, integrity, and availability of networks by protecting them against passive attacks like eavesdropping yet the transformation of classical to quantum computation can bear catastrophic implications as it has the potential to put the currently secure methods of transactions in jeopardy. This paper aims at the evaluation and comparison of traditional cryptographic techniques by the application of a SWOT framework. It takes up an exploratory study of the advanced quantum computing capabilities that can pose a massive risk to network security. The various security enhancements that can be adopted in data transmission to curtail these risks post-quantum are also discussed. AES. Blowfish. Cryptography. DH. ECC. Encryption. Post-Quantum.

Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security.Without substantial automation, individuals cannot manage the complexity of operations and the scale of information to be utilized to secure cyberspace. Nonetheless, technology and software with traditional fixed implementations are difficult to build (hardwired decision-making logic) in order to successfully safeguard against security threats. This condition can be dealt with using machine simplicity and learning methods in AI. This paper provides a concise overview of AI implementations of various cybersecurity using artificial technologies and evaluates the prospects for expanding the cybersecurity capabilities by enhancing the defence mechanism. We may infer that valuable applications already exist after the review of current artificial intelligence software on cybersecurity. First of all, they are used to protect the periphery and many other cybersecurity areas with neural networks. On the other hand, it was clear that certain cybersecurity problems would only be overcome efficiently if artificial intelligence approaches are deployed. In strategic decision making, for example, comprehensive information is important, and logical decision assistance is one of the still unanswered cybersecurity issues. Artificial Intelligence.

Modeling and Simulation Approaches for Cybersecurity Impact Analysis: State-of-the-Art.Designing resilient critical infrastructures involves ensuring the secure operation of the underlying systems and their components. Due to the ever-increasing integration of cyber components to monitor and control physical processes in such systems, cyberattacks can not only compromise the cyberinfrastructure but can also disrupt, delay, or thwart the physical processes and operations. Thus, a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment framework mandates analyzing the potential impact that successful exploits may have on such systems. In this paper, we survey the existing literature to aggregate the diverse modeling and simulation-based approaches that have been used to define and/or characterize the impact of attacks on cyber-physical and industrial control systems. The resulting analysis provides insight into the varying definitions of impact and domains of application, providing recommendations to guide future impact analysis studies. cyber-physical systems. cybersecurity. impact analysis. industrial control systems. survey 
Securing CHEESEHub: A Cloud-based, Containerized Cybersecurity Education Platform.The Cyber Human Ecosystem for Engaged Security Education (CHEESEHub) is an open web platform that hosts community-contributed containerized demonstrations of cybersecurity concepts. In order to maximize flexibility, scalability, and utilization, CHEESEHub is currently hosted in a Kubernetes cluster on the Jetstream academic cloud. In this short paper, we describe the security model of CHEESEHub and specifically the various Kubernetes security features that have been leveraged to secure CHEESEHub. This ensures that the various cybersecurity exploits hosted in the containers cannot be misused, and that potential malicious users of the platform are cordoned off from impacting not just other legitimate users, but also the underlying hosting cloud. More generally, we hope that this article will provide useful information to the research computing community on a less discussed aspect of cloud deployment: the various security features of Kubernetes and their application in practice. cloud computing. containers. cybersecurity.

Cyber Security Threats in Cloud: Literature Review.In recent years, data has been expanding every second in terms of velocity, volume, and variety. This has resulted in enormous and complex big data, raising challenges in the storage, management, analysis of these big data and security thereof. Many organizations tend to use cloud systems in order to facilitate the operation in big data without being fully aware of the security and privacy challenges that the utilization of these systems pose and consequently ignoring the important practices and techniques that should be implemented when using cloud systems. These security threats therefore require more research in order to produce solutions to the cloud system environment. The goal of this paper is collection of most common cyber security threats in the cloud system environment and most common used mitigation techniques by reviewing the published papers in the period from 2019 to 2020 followed by cloud risk assessment case study in an organization in Saudi Arabia. cloud. mitigation.

Cybersecurity Threats in Line with Awareness in Saudi Arabia.This study aims at exploring the cybersecurity threats in line with the awareness of Saudi Arabia nationals. This paper analyzes the recent threats reports conducted by IBM, McAfee and Kaspersky. Then this paper matches the analyzed threats reports with the awareness of the Saudi nationals by examining five surveys of related studies. The results of the analysis indicate the following: Saudi Arabia is considered one of the main targets in cybersecurity with a very costly data breach. Healthcare, Financial, technology, Multiple, Individual/private, and public sectors should be given a high priority and must implement extensive trainings and awareness programs. Also, malware, account hijacking, system errors are the most widely and costly threats and awareness should be targeting these threats. Also, the study concludes that most Saudis are aware of the security tools but there are a large number that do not use nor know about these tools. The study also has found that a large number of Saudis did not receive any awareness nor training programs and businesses are not paying much attention in this regard. The study also has found that a huge number of Saudis do not know how nor want to report cybercrimes. Cyber Awareness. Cyber Security. Cybercrime. Saudi Arabia

Enhancing Situational Awareness for Tutors of Cybersecurity Capture the Flag Games.Supervised Capture the Flag games represent a popular method of practical hands-on training in cybersecurity education. However, as cybersecurity training sessions are process-oriented, tutors have only a limited insight into what trainees are doing and how they deal with the tasks. From their perspective, it is necessary to have situational awareness, enabling them to identify and react to any issues during a training session as soon as they emerge. We propose a tool designed in collaboration with cybersecurity educators. Based on user requirements, we developed the Progress Visualization Tool, which provides educators with timely feedback through the session. More specifically, the tool informs educators of the training progression, helps identify the students who might struggle with their tasks, and reveals overall deviation from the schedule. We validated the tool through formative and summative qualitative in-lab evaluations. The participants appraised the impact on the training workflow and gave further insights regarding the tool. We discuss the insights and recommendations that arose from the evaluations as they could aid the design of future tools for supporting educators, not only of CTFs but also in other domains. cybersecurity education. hands-on training. situational awareness 
Hybrid architecture of LPV dynamical systems in the context of cyber security.This paper deals with an hybrid architecture involving LPV dynamical systems for encryption purpose, having in mind the context of cybersecurity. Such an hybrid architecture is motivated by the fact that it is a natural model, recast in a control-theoretic framework, of a so-called statistical self-synchronizing stream cipher. It is shown that flatness is central to guarantee the necessary synchronization between the cipher and the decipher. In this context, beyond synchronization, security must be a constraint to be taken into account as well. We especially focus 011 diffusion as a security criterion. The hybrid architecture is motivated to take advantage of both properties simultaneously. An illustrative example presents a numerical application and must be considered as a proof-of-concept before further investigation. Copyright . Cryptography. Lpv systems.

Investigating Potential Barriers to Cybersecurity Risk Management Investment in SMEs.Ignoring the importance of cybersecurity risk management in SMEs became an issue among decision-makers. Lack of strategic investment decision by SMEs could lead to further risks and vulnerabilities. The significant increase of cybersecurity threats might become a very difficult task for both SMEs and other parties in the future. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential barriers to cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs based on conducting several interviews with decision-makers in the sector to understand the causes of this prevention. The authors aim to reveal the role the SMEs' decision-makers are playing in addressing cybersecurity risks in recent years and to suggest avenues for further research. The paper follows a qualitative exploratory approach to identify those potential barriers. Starting with an invitation are distributed by e-mail, phone call, or social medial account, to hundreds of Saudi's decision-makers in the SMEs sector, asking them to participate in this study. As a result, 20 participants from various SMEs business sectors have agreed to participate. Therefore, six potential barriers that play a key role in the prevention of cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs, which are the financial capacity, the lack of awareness, the size of SMEs, the traditional commerce, the absence of risk standards, and the over-confidence of decision-makers. Some of these barriers impacts have been discussed before in different contexts. Yet, this study investigates these barriers impact on preventing SMEs from investing in CRM. Also, to the best of authors knowledge, none of previous research has combined these barriers together with an insight to measure their effect on managerial decision-making. Further research on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs is needed. Cybersecurity. cybersecurity risk management. SMEs 
Cybersecurity metrics for human-robot collaborative automotive manufacturing.A human-robot collaborative system was developed where a human co-worker and a collaborative robot collaborated to perform assembly tasks. We assumed such assembly tasks as the representative assembly tasks in the automotive manufacturing industry. We assumed that the collaborative assembly system would be a part of an industrial control system (ICS) in actual industrial environment. We recruited 20 human subjects to perform the assembly tasks in collaboration with the robot. We trained the subjects to enable them to perform the collaborative assembly tasks, and evaluate cybersecurity conditions (status) of the collaborative system. Each subject performed the collaborative assembly separately with the robot. At the end of the assembly task, each subject was asked to brainstorm, write down the cybersecurity assessment criteria as best as he/she could perceive or realize through his/her experiences with the collaborative system, and rate the cybersecurity status of the collaborative system for each of the criteria (i.e., how capable the collaborative system was in fulfilling the cybersecurity requirements for each criterion) using a five-point subjective rating scale (a Likert scale), where 1 indicated the least and 5 indicated the most secured system. We then analyzed the responses and determined a list of the tentative cybersecurity assessment criteria with their relative importance (the total frequency of each criterion proposed by the subjects was to indicate the importance level for that criterion). We also proposed how machine learning and data analytics could be applied to analyze the cybersecurity metrics and enhance cybersecurity in the collaborative system. The proposed cybersecurity metrics can serve as the preliminary effort towards developing comprehensive cybersecurity metrics and methods for human-robot collaborative assembly in automotive manufacturing in particular and for human-robot collaborative systems in general.

About the cybersecurity of automated process control systems.Recently, the number of hacker attacks on industrial production facilities has increased significantly. That growth is associated with the rapid development of information technologies for the control systems. The increase in the number of incidents has led to the emergence of cybersecurity - a new field of scientific and technical research that deals with the industrial companies security issues. Several widely discussed incidents are related to cybersecurity. For example, the STUXNET worm has infected Siemens industrial systems and inflicted heavy losses for the Iranian nuclear program. That worm made use of operating system vulnerabilities and the «human factor». The STUXNET worm has been also served as the basis for a number of modified viruses that have been used to successfully attack on various industrial networks. As Siemens is one of the world's key manufacturers of industrial equipment, the STUXNET has become widespread. Currently, many publications discuss STUXNET from different points of view. Researchers dealing with this problem often overlook the important fact that the existing standard communication protocols, interaction interfaces and embedded algorithms are in most cases unreliable and are not able to provide the proper level of security, but they focus on the vulnerabilities of intrusion detection and prevention systems. With the increasing number of cyber attacks and their expansion, it is necessary to develop secure communication channels and devices to implement the concept of safe industrial manufacturing. This paper analyzes modern process control systems from the point of view of information security. cyberattack. cybersecurity. industrial networks. Information security. SCADA systems. STUXNET worm 
Human Factors in Cybersecurity: A Scoping Review.Humans are often considered to be the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. However, traditionally the Computer Science (CS) researchers have investigated the technical aspects of cybersecurity, focusing on the encryption and network security mechanisms. The human aspect although very important is often neglected. In this work we carry out a scoping review to investigate the take of the CS community on the human-centric cybersecurity paradigm by considering the top conferences on network and computer security for the past six years. Results show that broadly two types of users are considered: expert and non-expert users. Qualitative techniques dominate the research methodology employed, however, there is a lack of focus on the theoretical aspects. Moreover, the samples have a heavy bias towards the Western community, due to which the results cannot be generalized, and the effect of culture on cybersecurity is a lesser known aspect. Another issue is with respect to the unavailability of standardized security-specific scales that can measure the cybersecurity perception of the users. New insights are obtained and avenues for future research are presented. Culture. Cybersecurity. Human factors. Theory 
The Cybersecurity Skills Survey: Response to the 2020 SIM IT Trends Study.

These findings were based upon input from over 1,000 IT leaders representing 37 SIM Chapters. The goals of the cybersecurity skills survey were to identify: (1) What technical skills are needed for entry-level professionals in cybersecurity jobs? (2) What professional skills are needed for entry level professionals in cybersecurity jobs? (3) What technical skills are needed for early-career professionals in cybersecurity jobs? and (4) What professional skills are needed for early-career professionals in cybersecurity jobs? The survey findings provide key insights into in-demand skills and  difficult-to-find competencies. This paper reports on 99 responses captured from IT leaders representing the SIM Chapters in St. Louis, Austin, Milwaukee, and Phoenix, and is part of an ongoing data collection effort to include the Chapters in Tampa, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, and Boston. Dialogues between academic professionals and industry leaders in each of these professional communities are contributing to meeting the demand for talented cybersecurity graduates. cybersecurity. it workforce. professional skills. technical skills 
Promoting Cybersecurity Culture Change in Healthcare.Cybersecurity problems have traditionally been addressed through technological solutions and staff training. Whilst technology can reduce or remove some weaknesses some attacks specifically target human users. Whilst training can educate staff on how to behave more securely, this is often not sufficient to promote actual secure behaviours . Knowing what to do is necessary but not sufficient. It is also necessary to remove barriers to the required behaviour and to intervene in a way that affords behaviour change. This is particularly true in healthcare, where environmental factors including time pressure, and staff fatigue can create barriers for cybersecurity behaviour change. Technology and training are only a partial solution. Only by taking a more holistic approach which encompasses technology, people and processes and addressing the culture change needed to facilitate more secure behaviours will any progress be made in the workplace. We conducted a series of in-depth interviews and workshops with staff across 3 healthcare organisations in Italy, Crete and Ireland. This paper reflects on our main findings, including key requirements for future cybersecurity interventions. We used this reflection to develop a secure behaviour toolkit to help healthcare organisations identify problematic behaviours, co-create interventions to increase secure staff behaviour being mindful that sometimes culture change is necessary to enable the required security behaviours. The toolkit also provides a means to evaluate the interventions identified and the final implementation of the intervention. behaviour change. culture. cybersecurity. healthcare. toolkit

Cybersecurity Analytics for Virtual Power Plants.This article presents a framework to realize cybersecure virtual power plant (VPP). The foundation of this cybersecurity analytics is established on a developed normal operation region identification methodology. This normal operation region is exploited as a confirmation strategy to distinguish malicious set-points that are determined by VPP cyber-layer. These malicious set-points are spawned by a cyber-attacker influencing the VPP cyber-layer. The normal operation region is based on a derived one-to-one mapping between the network internal point of common coupling (PCC) bus voltages and the cyber-layer generated set-points. This derived mapping is compared with an inverse mapping through internal PCC bus voltage monitoring for anomalies. Once, an inconsistency is witnessed by the cybersecurity analytics between the one-to-one mapping and the inverse mapping, then the initial voltage anomaly detected by the monitoring system is due to an intrusion. The developed theory is validated through simulation of a cyber attacker gradually violating the network stability boundary through manipulating the operation set-points. cybersecurity analytics. power electronics-dominated grid.

A Real-Time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Cybersecurity Testbed for Power Electronics Devices and Systems in Cyber-Physical Environments. Cybersecurity of power electronics (PE) is increasingly essential as more systems from renewable energy systems, energy storage systems, and electric vehicle charging stations utilize PE devices to connect them into power grids with complex communication and computation systems for advanced control and situational awareness improvement in smart grid environments. However, cybersecurity research and development (RD) of networked power electronics (PE) is hampered by the lack of real-time security testbed incorporating real cyber events. This paper proposes a real-time hardware-in-the-loop cybersecurity tested for PE systems in cyber-physical environments. The proposed security testbed consists of: 1) a real-time PE system simulator. 2) a real-time cyber system using real network systems and a server. and 3) penetration testing tools generating real Cyber-attacks as cyber events. Several real cyber-attacks are created and their impacts in a PE system are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed security testbed.

Spidey Sense: Designing Wrist-Mounted Affective Haptics for Communicating Cybersecurity Warnings. Improving end-users' awareness of cybersecurity warnings (e.g., phishing and malware alerts) remains a longstanding problem in usable security. Prior work suggests two key weaknesses with existing warnings: they are primarily communicated via saturated communication channels (e.g., visual, auditory, and vibrotactile). and, they are communicated rationally, not viscerally. We hypothesized that wrist-based affective haptics should address both of these weaknesses in a form-factor that is practically deployable: i.e., as a replaceable wristband compatible with modern smartwatches like the Apple Watch. To that end, we designed and implemented Spidey Sense, a wristband that produces customizable squeezing sensations to alert users to urgent cybersecurity warnings. To evaluate Spidey Sense, we applied a three-phased gGen-Rank-Verify' study methodology with 48 participants. We found evidence that, relative to vibrotactile alerts, Spidey Sense was considered more appropriate for the task of alerting people to cybersecurity warnings. Haptics. Security Warnings..

Teaching a Hands-On Mobile and Wireless Cybersecurity Course.The combination of theory-based and practical hands-on learning represents a powerful approach for cybersecurity education. Placing the student in the adversarial mindset strengthens this approach and is commonly exercised in network penetration testing, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation coursework. In this paper, we present an undergraduate mobile and wireless security course design that balances theoretical learning with a hands-on and adversarial thinking approach. Our course consists of inter-woven lectures and lab sessions. Labs consist of contemporary attacks against radio-frequency (RF) enabled hardware, Internet of Things (IoT) firmware, and wireless protocols. In the culmination exercise, the students attack a flawed RF protocol implemented on GnuRadio to allow students to demonstrate their knowledge synthesis. We believe that sharing this experience will prove valuable for instructors who wish to introduce adversarial thinking into mobile and wireless security courses while overcoming the challenge of remote students. cybersecurity education. gamification. mobile and wireless security. software defined radio 
NeoCyberKG: Enhancing Cybersecurity Laboratories with a Machine Learning-enabled Knowledge Graph.The hands-on lab is a critical component of cybersecurity education. There lacks of a coherent way to manage existing labs to provide a practical learning plan for learners in the cybersecurity area. Previous studies utilized the word embedding technologies to construct a knowledge graph and adopt it as a learning guide for students, but this approach has its limitations. In this paper, we present a new approach based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) method to replace word embedding in previous studies as it is more appropriate in a small-size corpus, and it is also able to create a mapping that connects both the topic of each lab and concepts contained in each lab. We use LSA to identify relevant semantic relations, extract relevant lab problems, and construct knowledge graphs from lab contents related to cybersecurity topics. We utilize the output of this study by establishing a web-based lab environment for students that: 1. providing lab index and searching, which contains concepts and knowledge extract from each lab. 2.building a recommendation/guidance system for cybersecurity labs and suggesting more relevant labs based on users learning preferences and past lab history to maximize learning outcomes. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we conducted a use case study and collected survey data from a graduate-level cybersecurity class at a public university. Our study shows that users tend to gain enhanced learning outcomes and express more interest in the cybersecurity area by leveraging the knowledge graph as a learning guide. cybersecurity. knowledge graph. laboratory 
A Novel Approach in Cyber Security for securing the Workplace of the Future in large Industry Setups.Cyber Security as a topic has been a major course of concern for any product offering. Digitization has been on the rise and with the impact of the COVID19 scenario, the need for realizing business requirements over a virtual setup has become critical. This has led to massive cyber-attacks that leads to stolen assets, lost reputation, lost business, financial losses, impact on the stock market, and theft of intellectual property so on. It is essential to build a security strategy to navigate through challenging times, recover quickly and continue to deliver the intended outcome. Security efficiency can be achieved by balancing and optimizing the relationships between people, processes, and technology. Investing in sustainable security culture is necessary as it transforms security from a one-time event into a lifecycle that generates security returns forever. In this paper, we explore an approach to achieve security culture changes among people that results in the change of process technology for a secure environment. This proposed paper also explores the impacts of people, processes, and technology and how each of these pillars contributes to a creation of a secure workplace of the future. Business Applications.

Teacher Views on Storytelling-based Cybersecurity Education with Social Robots.With children spending more time online, personal data are stored on their devices making them susceptible to online risks. Exposing students to cybersecurity education at an early age is critical for raising awareness and knowledge. Yet access to cybersecurity education curricular materials that are engaging for young students is limited. In this work, we present interactive cybersecurity stories for students in grades 3-5 delivered through a commercial social robot. Through focus groups and interviews we subsequently investigated teachers' views on using a social robot for cybersecurity education, interest in incorporating social robots in the classroom, and perceptions of the ways in which social robots can impact teaching practice and student learning. Findings indicated that teachers found the social robot engaging and expressed interest in using it in their classroom despite some concerns. Findings have implications for the design and implementation of cybersecurity curricula delivered through emerging technologies.
Cybersecurity risks: A behavioural approach through the influence of media and information literacy.The growing use of digital media has been accompanied by an increase of the risks associated with the use of information systems, notably cybersecurity risks. In turn, the increasing use of information systems has an impact on users' media and information literacy. This research aims to address the relationship between media and information literacy, and the adoption of risky cybersecurity behaviours. This approach will be carried out through the definition of a conceptual framework supported by a literature review, and a quantitative research of the relationships mentioned earlier considering a sample composed by students of a Higher Education Institution. cybersecurity.

A Visual Exploration of Cybersecurity Concepts.Cybersecurity-related concepts can be difficult to explain or summarise. The complexity associated with these concepts is compounded by the impact of rapid technological changes and the contextual nature of the meaning ascribed to the various themes. Since visual imagery is often employed in articulation and explanation, we conducted a study in which we asked participants to sketch their understanding of cybersecurity concepts. Based on an analysis of these sketches and subsequent discussions with participants, we make the case for the use of sketching and visuals as a tool for cybersecurity research. Our collection of sketches and icons can further serve as the seed for a visual vocabulary for cybersecurity-related interfaces and communication. cybersecurity. icons. imagery. privacy. risk. sketching. trust. visualisation 
Industry engagement for identification of cybersecurity needs practices for digital twins. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are helping to make smart cities a reality, thanks to technological advancements in the construction industry. Through use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT), CPS integrates information and the physical world. Integrating Building Information Models (BIM) with IoT and sensor using CPS is becoming a more common goal in the industry. The adoption of digital twins in the future will open up new opportunities for CPS using tracking, simulation, and optimization strategies. Researchers, on the other hand, often overlook the cybersecurity implications. Assimilation of BIM data and cybersecurity principles has been difficult so far, and as a result, cybersecurity has been neglected. Specifically, this research will address research question. What are the key cybersecurity needed practices of built environment stakeholders? To answer these questions, this paper will survey the research of adoption of the cyber-physical system and digital twins regarding the industry. and determine obstacles to the adoption of cybersecurity for digital twins/CPS in the built environment. The findings of this study validated the value of using digital twins in industry. As a result, this paper assesses the use of digital twins in CPSs in order to determine the practices for bolstering cybersecurity and integrating digital twin and city standards in future urban cities.

Cybersecurity for electric vehicle fast-charging infrastructure.The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into electric grid operations can potentially leave the grid vulnerable to cyberattacks from both legacy and new equipment and protocols, including extreme fast-charging infrastructure. This paper introduces a co-simulation platform to perform cyber vulnerability analysis of EV charging infrastructure and its dependencies on communications and control systems. Grid impact scenarios through linkages to power system simulation tools such as OpenDSS and vehicle infrastructure-specific attack paths are discussed. An adaptive platform that assists with predicting and solving evolving cybersecurity challenges is demonstrated with a cyber-energy emulation that accelerates the analysis of cyberattacks and system behavior.
A Software Diversity-Based Lab in Operating System for Cyber Security Students.The course of operating system's labs usually fall behind the state of art technology. In this paper, we propose a Software Diversity-Assisted Defense (SDAD) lab based on software diversity, mainly targeting for students majoring in cyber security and computer science. This lab is consisted of multiple modules and covers most of the important concepts and principles in operating systems. Thus, the knowledge learned from the theoretical course will be deepened with the lab. For students majoring in cyber security, they can learn this new software diversity-based defense technology and understand how an exploit works from the attacker's side. The experiment is also quite stretchable, which can fit all level students. Cyber Security. Operating System. Software Diversity 
A comparative study of cybersecurity awareness on phishing among employees from different departments in an organization.Cybersecurity is an important issue for people who usually use the Internet for their purposes (e.g., ecommerce) in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. For cyberthreats, phishing, which can be sent via email, can harm information systems in the organization. However, the risks from this kind of threats can be reduced if the employees have cybersecurity awareness. To prove this hypothesis with Thai employees, this paper presents a comparative study of cybersecurity awareness enhancement associated with the employees who work in different departments within the same organization in Bangkok, Thailand. In this study, the first phishing attack simulation was conducted before providing knowledge and training in cybersecurity to the employees and attacking with the second simulation. After result collection and analysis, it has been found that there are significant differences in cybersecurity awareness level between Thai employees from technology-based departments (e.g., IT department) and social-based departments (e.g., HR department) within the same organization. Of course, the technology-based employees are the better. Furthermore, it has been found that the cybersecurity awareness level of Thai employees from the social-based department, which were poor when compared to the other one, was improved obviously after they were involved with the cybersecurity awareness enhancement processes.
Cyber-Security through Dynamic Watermarking for 2-rotor Aerial Vehicle Flight Control Systems.We consider the problem of security for unmanned aerial vehicle flight control systems. To provide a concrete setting, we consider the security problem in the context of a helicopter which is compromised by a malicious agent that distorts elevation measurements to the control loop. This is a particular example of the problem of the security of stochastic control systems under erroneous observation measurements caused by malicious sensors within the system. In order to secure the control system, we consider dynamic watermarking, where a private random excitation signal is superimposed onto the control input of the flight control system. An attack detector at the actuator can then check if the reported sensor measurements are appropriately correlated with the private random excitation signal. This is done via two specific statistical tests whose violation signifies an attack. We apply dynamic watermarking technique to a 2-rotor-based 3-DOF helicopter control system test-bed. We demonstrate through both simulation and experimental results the performance of the attack detector on two attack models: a stealth attack, and a random bias injection attack.

Green IoT System Architecture for Applied Autonomous Network Cybersecurity Monitoring.Network security morning (NSM) is essential for any cybersecurity system, where the average cost of a cyberattack is 1.1 million. No matter how much a system is secure, it will eventually fail without proper and continuous monitoring. No wonder that the cybersecurity market is expected to grow up to 170.4 billion in 2022. However, the majority of legacy industries do not invest in NSM implementation until it is too late due to the initial and operation cost and static unutilized resources. Thus, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Internet of things (IoT) architecture for an industrial NSM that features a low installation and operation cost, low power consumption, intelligent organization behavior, and environmentally friendly operation. As a case study, the system is implemented in a midrange oil a gas manufacture facility in the southern states with more than 300 machines and servers over three remote locations and a production plant that features a challenging atmosphere condition. The proposed system successfully shows a significant saving (gt 65%) in power consumption, acquires one-tenth the installation cost, develops an intelligent operation expert system tools as well as saves the environment from more than 500 mg of CO2 pollution per hour, promoting green IoT systems.

A Census of Swedish Public Sector Employee Communication on Cybersecurity during the COVID-19 Pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of the Swedish public sector, and to ensure the success of this ongoing process cybersecurity plays an integral part. While Sweden has come far in digitalization, the maturity of cybersecurity work across entities covers a wide range. One way of improving cybersecurity is through communication, thereby enhancing employee cyber situation awareness. In this paper, we conduct a census of Swedish public sector employee communication on cybersecurity at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic using questionnaires. The study shows that public sector entities find the same sources of information useful for their cybersecurity work. We find that nearly two thirds of administrative authorities and almost three quarters of municipalities are not yet at the implemented cybersecurity level. We also find that 71 % of municipalities have less than one dedicated staff for cybersecurity. COVID-19. Cybersecurity. public sector. situation awareness 
The Cybersecurity (CSEC) Questionnaire: Individual Differences in Unintentional Insider Threat Behaviours.The present study identifies a number of individual difference traits that are related to cyber hygiene behaviour in order to develop a brief questionnaire. The resulting questionnaire identifies basic vulnerabilities in users' practices consisting of updating software, changing passwords, and disclosure of information on social media platforms (SMPs). Using existing scales assessing individual differences (i.e., conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness, regulatory focus), we argue that the cybersecurity scale (CSEC) can be used to identify individuals within an organization that need remedial education and training. Moreover, CSEC scores differentiate between assessment disclosure vulnerability and intrusion vulnerability, allowing for the identification of different kinds of cybersecurity practices. insider threat detection. personality traits. unintentional insider threat 
Cybersecurity behavior under covid-19 influence.The aim of the article is to study the impact of the stress related to covid-19 on the cybersecurity behaviors of students. Based on a survey questionnaire, we will stress that cyber security behavior (CSB) is not directly affected by the stress related to covid-19. The influence of the covid stress is mainly on cybersecurity self-efficacy, but only marginally. Further, the CBS is explained by the ease of use, the response cost, self-efficacy, different protective neutralization techniques, social guardianship, but not perceived susceptibility and severity to digital threat. covid- 19. cyber security behavior.

'Hacking an IoT Home': New opportunities for cyber security education combining remote learning with cyber-physical systems. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic shift in educational practice, whereby home-schooling and remote working became the norm. Many typical schools outreach projects to encourage uptake of learning cyber security skills therefore were put on hold, due to the inability to physical attend and inspire. In this short paper, we describe a new approach to teaching cyber security with a view of inspiring a new generation of learners to the subject. Traditional Capture-The-Flag exercises are widely used in cyber security education, whereby a series of challenges are completed to gain access and obtain a passphrase from a computer system. We couple this approach with interactive sessions made possible via video conferencing platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, along with the very nature of being in the home environment, where home IoT devices are now commonplace. We develop an integrated CTF for the home IoT environment, where students can observe the impact of submitting flags via online video, to physical adjust the home environment - ranging from switching off lights, playing music, or controlling an IoT-enabled robot. The result is a highly interactive and engaging experience that benefits from the very nature of remote working, inspiring the notion of  hacking an IoT home .
Towards a Healthcare Cybersecurity Certification Scheme.The EU Cybersecurity Act introduces cybersecurity certification framework for ICT products, services and processes. Following ENISA's EUCC (the Common Criteria based European candidate cybersecurity certification scheme), we provide the Security Problem and identify Security Requirements of a healthcare specific product through a Protection Profile. We consult ENISA's reports to identify the most impactful assets in healthcare that should be prioritized for certification. We select a sub-category system of Clinical Information Systems, such as Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) for Protection Profile. Based on five use-cases of PACS, we define the Security Problem (assumptions, organizational security policies, threats) and we elaborate the Security Objectives. We, further, conduct a sector specific analysis of challenges and threats in healthcare sector to supplement the PACS specific threats. We detail Security Objectives from the Cybersecurity Act, and we offer a combination of these two elements, the broader scope of threats and objectives, as a baseline for future Protection Profiles of healthcare specific products. We further provide PACS specific Security Functional Requirements, and we conclude with a guideline for selecting suitable Security Assurance Requirements. assurance level. certification. common criteria. cybersecurity. healthcare.

Tool-assisted Threat Modeling for Smart Grid Cyber Security.Threat modeling is about identifying architectural flaws and weaknesses in a system in order to mitigate them and avoid unwanted incidents caused by an attacker. Tool-assisted threat modeling has seen limited use in complex cyber-physical systems involving both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of tool-assisted threat modeling to the complex cyber-physical system that is the smart grid, and present a new Smart Grid template for the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. We demonstrate benefits of our smart grid threat modeling template on a use-case, and discuss limitations. Data Flow Diagram. Smart Grid. STRIDE. Threat modelin1 
HSE and Cyber Security in Remote Work.Digitalization and increased use of remote operations is a growing industrial trend. Work that previously had to be done physically on a facility, can now be conducted from remote locations. However, remote operations may lead to new vulnerabilities and risk. This paper presents results from a study on Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) consequences and cybersecurity in remote operation of oil and gas installations. The paper addresses digital technology that supports, controls and monitors industrial production and safety functions (Operational Technology), and not general (administrative) Information Technology. A main challenge in remote operations pinpointed in the study, is the increased complexity and interactivity for managing crisis situations. Thus, increased collaboration between operator companies and system suppliers should be facilitated, including regular physical meetings. The distinction between work process and work form is important in understanding the necessary reorganizing of work when implementing remote operations. Further development of cyber security practices should draw more heavily on the ideas behind the resilience concept. The study is based on 14 group interviews with representatives from operating companies, drilling companies and system suppliers. Cyber Security. Cyber-Physical Systems. HSE. Industry 4.0.

Cybersecurity, Computer Networks Phishing, Malware, Ransomware, and Social Engineering Anti-Piracy Reviews.With the rapid development of technology, connection to the internet is an indispensable element of life. With the Covid-19 Pandemic outbreak, online education with a computer and tablet mobile phone has become mandatory due to the remote training. The security of these tools used for connectivity has become critical. In this process, online shopping from homes has increased considerably. Due to this use among users for the first time and due to fast service, security vulnerabilities expose users to a difficult situation and cyberbullying. The fact that the devices are on the internet as wired or wireless makes it inevitable that they are vulnerable. The exposure of such devices in your home to cyberattacks means a violation of your privacy, along with many of your personal data. Nowadays, even the fine details of such technologies are trying to steal personal data by using the need to believe, such as phone fraud or pandemic vaccines. It is becoming increasingly important to inform end users of internet technology and security weaknesses in this field and to create awareness. If these are increased, the number of people exposed to cyber attacks will decrease. The first method for this is to reach these people and education . Cyber Attacks. Cyber Vulnerability.

Study on cybersecurity attack-defense visualization method based on intelligent connected vehicle.Attack test and defense verification are important ways to effectively evaluate the cybersecurity performance of Intelligent Connected Vehicle (ICV). This paper investigates the problem of attack-defense visualization in ICV cybersecurity. For the purpose of promoting cybersecurity research capabilities, a novel Cybersecurity Attack-Defense Visualization method based on Intelligent Connected Vehicle (CADV-ICV) is proposed. In this scheme, an Attack-Defense Game model (ADG) is designed so that the logical relationship between the attack and defense can be studied through a system architecture. Then, the CADV-ICV method is implemented through three layers that are hardware layer, software layer and visualization layer. Finally, through an Intelligent Connected Vehicle, two TV monitors, a computer and a server, a real experimental environment is built to test the CADV-ICV method. The experimental results show that CADV-ICV can realize the visual display of attack-defense process, attack messages, defense state, real-time message monitoring, and attack-defense principle for 10 car's components.

An Open-Source Testbed to Visualise ICS Cybersecurity Weaknesses and Remediation Strategies - A Research Agenda Proposal.Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are responsible for the control of several processes in various critical infrastructure deployments ranging from energy, power and water utilities, to manufacturing sectors such as pharmaceutical precision engineering. They ensure the smooth, safe running and High Availability of these critical infrastructure and manufacturing processes. ICS cybersecurity is of increasing concern and this is evidenced by the mounting examples of cyber threats and attacks on ICS infrastructure that are referenced both within the technical community and the public media. The barriers of entry to ICS cybersecurity are still high given the limited skills base, expensive and proprietary hardware and software, as well as the inherent dangers of manipulating real physical processes. This greatly inhibits the practical application of cybersecurity tools in ICS environments and therefore the opportunity for practitioners to gain valuable experience. Furthermore, historical ICS testbeds have not delivered a practical application of accessing and improving ICS security posture as poisited in known ICS industry standards. This project seeks to build a comprehensive opensource virtualised ICS testbed to demonstrate typical cybersecurity weaknesses in an ICS environment as well as suitable remediation strategies. This testbed shall simulate real world industrial systems as closely as possible without replicating an entire plant. This research will identify a suitable ICS testbed to visualise the stages of an ICS cyber attack with reference to the ICS cyber kill chain proposed by the SysAdmin, Audit, Network and Security Institute. With the selected ICS testbed as a reference, this project shall also demonstrate an ICS cybersecurity evaluation based on the US National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, detailing how defenders can identify vulnerable components in the ICS, identify potential threat vectors within the environment and develop suitable mitigations to improve the organisations overall security posture. This project contributes to growing ICS cybersecurity skills to better protect industrial processes and critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity. GRFICS. ICS. ICS Cyber Kill Chain 
Cybersecurity as a New Type of Security and Its New Perception.Cybersecurity is critical to both Prosperity and Security. As our daily lives and economies have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, we have become increasingly exposed to cyber threats. Cybersecurity incidents are increasingly diverse - both in terms of who is responsible and what they are trying to achieve. Unfair activities in cyberspace threaten our economies - and the very functioning of democracies, freedoms, and values. This article describes Cybersecurity as a relatively new and unexplored security field. The introduction deals with the definition of Cybersecurity and its relationship with Cybernetics. It describes the short-term - (for now), development of Computer Security with Information Technology Development. The research section deals with separating Cybersecurity as a wholly new - and sovereign field of Information Security. This is followed by a description of the 'life' of a new type of Security and Cybersecurity and Standardisation Security Issues.

Cybersecurity in complex operations: A post-drilling approach foroil and gas wells.Many companies are now workingto converge business models and engineering processes with the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. The automation of industrial processes together with the implementationof infrastructure,makes it possible to interconnect people and performance indicators in real-time, reducing the decision-making time and time in themarketplace. This provides companies with unprecedented opportunities to create and capture value while rethinking business models but brings vulnerabilities and risks that must be properly assessed and mitigated. New malicious third parties are emerging and directly threaten the efforts of companies. The purpose of this article is to enumerate the possible attackers (vectors) and to define the possible areas where they can attack companies (surfaces), illustratingwith the example of drilling operations in the oil and gas industry, in order to provide discussion points about what new competencies technicians need to developto face these emerging threats.
Sanitizing the IoT Cyber Security Posture: An Operational CTI Feed Backed up by Internet Measurements.The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm at large continues to be compromised, hindering the privacy, dependability, security, and safety of our nations. While the operational security communities (i.e., CERTS, SOCs, CSIRT, etc.) continue to develop capabilities for monitoring cyberspace, tools which are IoT-centric remain at its infancy. To this end, we address this gap by innovating an actionable Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) feed related to Internet-scale infected IoT devices. The feed analyzes, in near real-time, 3.6TB of daily streaming passive measurements (1M pps) by applying a custom-developed learning methodology to distinguish between compromised IoT devices and non-IoT nodes, in addition to labeling the type and vendor. The feed is augmented with third party information to provide contextual information. We report on the operation, analysis, and shortcomings of the feed executed during an initial deployment period. We make the CTI feed available for ingestion through a public, authenticated API and a front-end platform. Cyber Threat Intelligence. Data science. Internet-of-Things (IoT). Network telescopes.

Vehicular Platoon Communication: Cybersecurity Threats and Open Challenges.Vehicular platooning is an emerging technology that promises to save space on congested roadways, improve safety and utilise less fuel for transporting goods, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This technology will draw the attention of attackers seeking to profit or prove themselves to their peers by disrupting the platoons. A platoon has several attack surfaces that attackers can exploit to achieve their goals (either personal or financial). This paper aims to discuss various attacks that the attackers can launch against platoons by exploiting wireless communication weaknesses. Furthermore, we will present different known strategies which are currently used to defend platoons from attackers. This paper's primary contribution we believe will help new researchers in this domain, as well as automotive industries and smart cities planners. Communication Security. Cyber Attacks.

On Medical Device Cybersecurity Compliance in EU.The medical device products at the European Union market must be safe and effective. To ensure this, medical device manufacturers must comply to the new regulatory requirements brought by the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR). In general, the new regulations increase regulatory requirements and oversight, especially for medical software, and this is also true for requirements related to cybersecurity, which are now explicitly addressed in the legislation. The significant legislation changes currently underway, combined with increased cybersecurity requirements, create unique challenges for manufacturers to comply with the regulatory framework. In this paper, we review the new cybersecurity requirements in the light of currently available guidance documents, and pinpoint four core concepts around which cybersecurity compliance can be built. We argue that these core concepts form a foundations for cybersecurity compliance in the European Union regulatory framework. cybersecurity.

Quantum Communication for Post-Pandemic Cybersecurity.Current approaches to cybersecurity will become increasingly inadequate as the use of networks grows and hacking becomes more skilled. One response to this problem lies in quantum technologies. In particular, the extreme sensitivity of quantum communication makes interference readily detectable and can provide secure encryption-key distribution. However, this is likely to benefit primarily high-value networks that use encryption, leaving insecure the growing use of mass networks for distributed work. The options to approaching this conundrum are (1) to accept where quantum technology leads, (2) to accelerate the technology in general without regard to how it is used, or (3) to push the technology to include mass use. We recommend a public-private strategy for the United States and its allies to effect both high-end and mass use.11The authors would especially like to acknowledge Professor Nathalie de Leon of the Princeton Quantum Initiative, Princeton University, whose input on quantum science has been invaluable.

Cyber-Security of Decentralized and Distributed Control Architectures with Machine-Learning Detectors for Nonlinear Processes.With the expansion in communication networks, vulnerability to cyber intrusions also increases. This work investigates the effect of different types of standard cyber-attacks on the operation of nonlinear processes under decentralized and distributed model predictive control (MPC) systems. The robustness of the decentralized control architecture over distributed control architecture is analyzed. Moreover, a machine-learning-based detector is trained using sensor data to monitor the cyber security of the overall system. Specifically, detectors built using feed-forward neural networks are used to detect the presence of an attack. A nonlinear chemical process example is simulated to demonstrate the robustness of decentralized control architectures and the effectiveness of the neural-network detection scheme in maintaining the closed-loop stability of the system.
Using Counterfactual Regret Minimization and Monte Carlo Tree Search for Cybersecurity Threats. Mitigating cyber threats requires adequate understanding of the attacker characteristics in particular their patterns. Such knowledge is essential in addressing the defensive measures that mitigate the attack. If the attacker enters in the network system, the game tree model generates resources by to counter such threat. This is done by altering the parity in the next game tree iteration which yield an adequate response to counter it. If an attacker enters a network system, and a game tree models the resources he must interface with, then that game tree can be altered, by changing the parity on the next to last iteration. This paper analyzes the sequence of patterns based on incoming attacks. The detection of attacker's pattern and subsequent changes in iterations to counter threat can be viewed as adequate resource or know how in cyber threat mitigations It was realized that changing the game tree of the hacker deprives the attacker of network resources and hence would represent a defensive measure against the attack. that is changing varying or understanding attacker paths, creates an effective defensive measure to protect the system against the incoming threats.. In this paper we analyze a unique combination of CFR and MCTS that attempts to detect the behavior of a hacker. Counterfactual Regret (CFR) is a game theory concept that helps identify patterns of attacks. The pattern recognition concept of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used in harmony with CFR in order to enhance the detection of attacks.

A new Cybersecurity Strategy for IoE by Exploiting an Optimization Approach.Today's companies are increasingly relying on Internet of Everything (IoE) to modernize their operations. The very complexes characteristics of such system expose their applications and their exchanged data to multiples risks and security breaches that make them targets for cyber attacks. The aim of our work in this paper is to provide an cybersecurity strategy whose objective is to prevent and anticipate threats related to the IoE. An economic approach is used in order to help to take decisions according to the reduction of the risks generated by the non definition of the appropriate levels of security. The considered problem have been resolved by exploiting a combinatorial optimization approach with a practical case of knapsack. We opted for a bi-objective modeling under uncertainty with a constraint of cardinality and a given budget to be respected. To guarantee a robustness of our strategy, we have also considered the criterion of uncertainty by taking into account all the possible threats that can be generated by a cyber attacks over IoE. Our strategy have been implemented and simulated under MATLAB environement and its performance results have been compared to those obtained by NSGA-II metaheuristic. Our proposed cyber security strategy recorded a clear improvment of efficiency according to the optimization of the security level and cost parametrs. Cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity.

Analysis of Control Channel Cybersecurity of the Consumer-Grade UAV by the Example of DJI Tello. This paper presents the assessment of cybersecurity of the non-industrial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV. using DJI Tello as an example) wireless control channel, implemented on the basis of Wi-Fi Wireless Local Area Network technology. As a result of the research, a model of an adversary conducting a cyberattack on the UAV communication channel was developed, and scenarios of an intruder's actions (aimed at taking control of the UAV or disabling it) were considered. Relevant block diagrams of the actions of an adversary were also developed. Based on the results of the analysis, a security strategy is proposed. It provides the maximum possible protection (based on the technical characteristics of the drone) and comprises not only passive protection in the form of setting a tough password, but also active actions -deploying a system to monitor the injections of deauthentication/dissociation frames and/or the creation of duplicate wireless networks.
Work-in-progress-design and evaluation of mixed reality programs for cybersecurity education.With the shortage of cybersecurity professionals, there is a critical need to train more young-generation cybersecurity professionals to fill the gap. In this work, we designed interactive activities that make abstract cybersecurity concepts more tangible by using exciting new mixed reality (MR) technology to teach cybersecurity skills and raise the potential interest in cybersecurity careers for middle school students. We plan to analyze the immersive experience, situational interest, and workload after the experiment to study the participants' learning performance and user experience. cybersecurity education. mixed reality.

Risk Classification Method of Vehicle Cyber Security Based on Hybrid Analysis.With the rapid development of the network technology of intelligent connected vehicles, the cyber security risk classification of vehicles will provide a good reference for the cyber security management of intelligent connected vehicles. This paper introduces the method of cyber security risk classification of automotive parts in the process of risk assessment. By using the hybrid analysis method of qualitative and quantitative, the cyber security related items of automotive are identified and the key feature information is extracted. At the same time, the risk level is calculated by using the quantitative evaluation method based on attack potential. In addition, the effectiveness of this method is verified by taking the vehicle information terminal T-Box as an example. Cyber Security. Risk Assessment. Risk Classification. T-BOX 
Design and development of iot testbed with DDoS attack for cyber security research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is clubbed by networking of sensors and other embedded electronics. As more devices are getting connected, the vulnerability of getting affected by various IoT threats also increases. Among the IoT threads, DDoS attacks are causing serious issues in recent years. In IoT, these attacks are challenging to detect and isolate. Thus, an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential to defend against these attacks. The traditional IDS is based on manual blacklisting. These methods are time-consuming and will not be effective to detect novel intrusions. At present, IDS are automated and programmed to be dynamic which are aided by machine learning deep learning models. The performance of these models mainly depends on the data used to train the model. Majority of IDS study is performed with non-compatible and outdated datasets like KDD 99 and NSL KDD. Research on specific DDoS attack datasets is very less. Therefore, in this paper, we first aim to examine the effect of existing datasets in the IoT environment. Then, we propose a real-time data collection framework for DNS amplification attacks in IoT. The generated network packets containing DDoS attack is captured through port mirroring. DDOS. DNS Attack.

Towards Practical Cybersecurity Mapping of STRIDE and CWE - A Multi-perspective Approach. Cybersecurity practitioners seek to prevent software vulnerabilities during the whole life-cycle of systems. Threat modeling which is done on the system design phase is an efficient way for securing systems. preventing system flaws is easier and more efficient than patching the security of the system later on. Therefore, many Secure Software Development methods include threat modeling as an integral part of the methodology. STRIDE is a popular threat modeling method used by many practitioners. Threat modelers using the STRIDE method work with abstract threat categories, and would benefit learning about the information about current system weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The information is available on the weakness and vulnerability databases (such as the CWE and the CVE). To our knowledge, there exists no mapping between the STRIDE threats and the actual weaknesses and vulnerabilities listed on the databases, thus hindering the effectiveness of the threat modeling and the DevSecOps and Secure Software Development Life Cycle methods as a whole. This work attempts to bridge the gap by exploring possible mappings between the STRIDE threats and the CWE weaknesses, with the goal of improving the cybersecurity processes from end to end. The paper explores three different approaches for mapping the STRIDE to the CWE weakness database, and discusses the findings. The paper concludes that the mapping between the STRIDE and the CWE 'Technical Impact' and 'Scope' elements of the CWE entries is the most prominent for the mapping. Paper also shows that other mappings were challenged by the different conceptual backgrounds between the threats and the weaknesses. The paper also discusses the challenges caused by the inherent vagueness of the items within the frameworks and the CWE and CVE databases, causing that the mappings to these databases remain largely as a manual tasks, which should be carried out by the domain experts.
Demo abstract: A hil emulator-based cyber security testbed for dc microgrids.In DC microgrids (DCmGs), distributed control is becoming a promising framework due to prominent scalability and efficiency. To transmit essential data and information for system control, various communication network topologies and protocols have been employed in modern DCmGs. However, such communication also exposes the DCmG to unexpected cyber attacks. In this demo, a scalable cyber security testbed is established for conducting hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) exper-iments and comprehensively investigating the security impact on DCmGs. Specifically, the testbed employs a Typhoon HIL 602+ emulator, which is professional in power electronics system emulation, to demonstrate four (12 at most) distributed energy resources (DERs). The communication network is implemented through the self-loop RS-232 interface. Based on the testbed, we systematically investigate the impact of two kinds of typical cyber attacks (i.e., false data injection and replay attacks). Experimental results show that both attacks will deteriorate the point-of-common coupling (PCC) voltages of the DERs and jeopardize the stability of the whole DCmG.
Participatory Threat Modelling: Exploring Paths to Reconfigure Cybersecurity. We present  participatory threat modelling as a feminist cybersecurity practice which allows technology research to centre traditionally marginalized and excluded experiences. We facilitated a series of community workshops in which we invited participants to define their own cybersecurity threats, implement changes to defend themselves, and reflect on the role cybersecurity plays in their lives. In doing so, we contest both hierarchical approaches to users in cybersecurity - which seek to g€solve' the problems of human behavior - and a tendency in HCI to equate action research with the development of novel technology solutions. Our findings draw highlight barriers to engaging with cybersecurity, the role of personal experiences (for instance of gender, race or sexuality) in shaping this engagement, and the benefits of communal approaches to cybersecurity. action research. community engagement.

Blockchain-Based Cyber Security and Advanced Distribution in Smart Grid.Blockchain commoditizes confidence in a step to grid flexibility and allows decentralized smart contracts to enforce auditable multiparty payments based on established standards among distributed power suppliers and customers. Smart contracts reduce the need to communicate with foreign entities, making it feasible for distributed energy trades and exchanges, including energy flows and financial activity, to be implemented and monetized. It might help decrease the cost of transactive energy and increase protection. This work provides how a renewable energy business is secure and how privacy and anonymity are given for such a system through blockchain implementation. blockchain. cyber security. distributed energy resource (DER). smart grid 
The urgency of cyber security in secure networks.In today's world, there is an unprecedented access to different online shopping sites, online banking sites, social media, etc. Even doctors can diagnose diseases when a patient watching TV at the comfort of their home. Everything can be done with just one tap. Paying utility bills, online shopping (Amazon, Flipkart, eBay, etc.), buying grocery and even salon services are done online, but every individual is concerned about security while using the INTERNET. Cyber Security then came into existence and our personal data is encrypted and can only be accessed by the Encryption key (passwords). Many Cyber-Crimes took place in recent years like credit card frauds, malware, online bunco, and so on. 50% and more users are the victims of cyber-crime. These crimes make people a bit conscious while they are online. Many frauds have taken place and the guilty for the same was found in no time because of Cyber Law.

A survey on cyber security IDS using ML methods.The growing rate of cyber-attacks on system networks in recent years exacerbates the privacy and security of computer infrastructure and personal computers. Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems are turning into a significant section of computer networks and cyber security. Various techniques are proposed by individuals to mitigate this problem. This gives rise to another problem of which technique should be used for a given scenario. This survey paper provides a solution to the aforementioned problem and presents a comparative study of different proposed models for intrusion detection and prevention systems which consist of machine learning algorithms to attain better performance and accuracy and to enhance cyber security. This paper aims to discern pros and cons of various intrusion detection and prevention techniques to gain better understanding and help researchers make more informed choices in selecting the appropriate security model to produce successful results.

Training and embedding cybersecurity guardians in older communities..Older adults can struggle to access relevant community expertise when faced with new situations. One such situation is the number of cyberattacks they may face when interacting online. This paper reports on an initiative which recruited, trained, and supported older adults to become community cybersecurity educators (CyberGuardians), tasked with promoting cybersecurity best practice within their communities to prevent older adults falling victim to opportunistic cyberattacks. This initiative utilised an embedded peer-to-peer information dissemination strategy, rather than expert-to-citizen, facilitating the inclusion of individuals who would ordinarily be unlikely to seek cybersecurity information and thus may be vulnerable to cyberattacks. We report on ways the CyberGuardians used informal methods to create more aware communities, served as role models for behaviour change and indirectly improved their personal wellbeing. We discuss considerations for supporting CyberGuardians, including implications for sustainability and for replicating this model in other digital contexts, e.g., recognising misinformation or improving mental health.

A Framework for Document-level Cybersecurity Event Extraction from Open Source Data.With the rapid development of the Internet, the number of cyber threats increases exponentially. More and more cyber threats come from new and unexpected sources, leading organizations and individuals to facing more security risks and vulnerabilities. Automatically obtaining and structuring security information from cybersecurity news can help security analysts to identify useful information more quickly. Most existing studies on extracting security events merely focused on the event detection task, aiming to discover and categorize cybersecurity events from the plain text. However, such event detection methods cannot capture useful information such as who performed the cyberattack, when the data breach event happened, who was the victim, etc. These arguments of a cybersecurity event are needed for analysts to get cybersecurity event details directly. Several studies have tried to extract rich semantic information of cybersecurity events, but they merely focused on extracting event arguments within the sentence scope. These studies still have limitations when the event arguments needed to recognize spread across multiple sentences. In this paper, we proposed a framework that effectively extracts cybersecurity events at the document-level from cybersecurity news, blogs and announcements. We model the document-level event extraction task as a sequence tagging problem. The goal is to identify the related arguments of cybersecurity events from documents. Firstly, we get the characters embedding and incorporate the word information into the character representations. Then we design a sliding window mechanism to get the cross-sentence context information. Finally, we predict the label of each character. We build a Chinese cybersecurity dataset and use three methods to evaluate our method, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. collaborative cyber threat intelligence. cybersecurity events. event extraction 
Cyber Security in Virtualized Communication Networks: Open Challenges for NATO.Modern multi-nation military communication and information systems demand rapid deployment and reconfiguration to enable secure information exchange between domains belonging to different nations. In order to support such a multi-nation mission scenarios NATO has been developing the concept of a federated mission network (FMN). These networks are leveraging the advantages of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) to adapt to a wide range of security requirements using network security functions (NSF). The investigation reported in this paper discusses two use cases, namely how to automate security policy evaluation, and how to deploy a security guard (Information Exchange Function) between network segments with different classification. Both cases use network scenarios from protected core network (PCN) because the goal is to compile open challenges to automate the deployment and management of secure coalition networks.

Managing Cybersecurity Risk Using Threat Based Methodology for Evaluation of Cybersecurity Architectures. To manage limited resources available to protect against cybersecurity threats, organizations must use risk management approach to prioritize investments in protection capabilities. Currently, there is no commonly accepted methodology for cybersecurity professionals that considers one of the key elements of risk function - threat landscape - to identify gaps (blinds spots) where cybersecurity protections do not exist and where future investments are needed. This paper discusses a new, threat-based approach for evaluation of cybersecurity architectures that allows organizations to look at their cybersecurity protections from the standpoint of an adversary. The approach is based on a methodology developed by the Department of Defense and further expanded by the Department of Homeland Security. The threat-based approach uses a cyber threat framework to enumerate all threat actions previously observed in the wild and scores protections (cybersecurity architectural capabilities) against each threat action for their ability to: a) detect. b) protect against. and c) help in recovery from the threat action. The answers form a matrix called capability coverage map - a visual representation of protections coverage, gaps, and overlaps against threats. To allow for prioritization, threat actions can be organized in a threat heat map - a visual representation of threat actions' prevalence and maneuverability that can be overlaid on top of a coverage map. The paper demonstrates a new threat modeling methodology and recommends future research to establish a decision-making framework for designing cybersecurity architectures (capability portfolios) that maximize protections (described as coverage in terms of protect, detect, and respond functions) against known cybersecurity threats. assessment. cyber threat framework. cybersecurity architecture. cybersecurity capabilities. evaluation. risk. risk management. threat modeling 
Teaching team collaboration in cybersecurity: A case study from the transactive memory systems perspective.Recent trends in the cybersecurity workforce have recognized that effective solutions for complex problems require collective efforts from individuals with diverse sets of knowledge, skills, and abilities. Therefore, the growing need to train students in team collaboration skills propelled educators in computer science and engineering to adopt team-based pedagogical strategies. Team-based pedagogy has shown success in enhancing students' knowledge in course subjects and their motivation in learning. However, it is limited in offering concrete frameworks specifically focusing on how to teach team collaboration skills. As part of an interdisciplinary effort, we draw on Transactive Memory Systems Theory-a communication theory that explains how individuals in groups learn who knows what and organize who does what-in developing a Team Knowledge Sharing Assignment as a tool for student teams to structure their team collaboration processes. This paper reports a result of a case study in designing and facilitating the assignment for cybersecurity students enrolled in a scholarship program. Students' evaluations and the instructor's assessment reveal that the assignment made a positive impact on students' team collaboration skills by helping them successfully identify their team members' expertise and capitalize on their team's knowledge resources when delegating functional roles. Based on this case study, we offer practical suggestions on how the assignment could be used for various classes or cybersecurity projects and how instructors could maximize its benefits.

Flipped mastery and gamification to teach computer networks in a cybersecurity engineering degree during COVID-19.This paper presents the results of applying the flipped learning methodology in its flipped mastery variant, complemented with some gamification strategies to teach computer networks in a cybersecurity engineering degree at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain. The main advantage of the flipped mastery methodology is that students really learn the subject, they don't just pass it. Introducing gamification strategies, such as badges, points, and the Escape Room activity, was also important to improve student's motivation. The methodology was easily adapted to the COVID pandemic scenario, as most of the material was already available online. Nevertheless, work in class was intended to be team-based and due to the restrictions on mobility that had to be changed. The use of breakout rooms to group students during the online sessions was the implemented solution. All sessions and exams were performed remotely, and the academic results and satisfaction with the methodology were very high. Computer networks. Cybersecurity. Flipped learning. Gamification.

Cybersecurity teaching expert development project by KOSEN security educational community.Threats of cyber attacks are rampant all over the world. The threats are getting stronger year by year. In 2015, the National Institute of Technology (KOSEN) launched the KOSEN Security Educational Community (K-SEC) and started cyber security training for KOSEN students. This project has two main purposes that one is outstanding cyber security human resource development which objects for improving quality and other one is fostering many KOSEN students who have systematically acquired security knowledge which objects for quantitative expansion. As part of K-SEC, research of cyber security human resource development education has been promoted. A new project 'Highly Advanced Cybersecurity for KOSEN (HACK) ' has been launched within K-SEC to accelerate the achievement of the two main purposes since 2019. HACK is a project based on the simple idea of strengthening KOSEN technical staff in order to foster strong students who have acquired practical cyber security skills. The plan is a three-year plan. HACK has three main objectives which are improving faculties ' and technical staffs' skills, the development excellent teaching materials based on the skills and to create both skills and human resources network. The success of HACK is important to contribute not only to security education but also to the examination of KOSEN or engineering education centered on practical education. In this paper, we will evaluate the effectiveness and legal theory of cyber security practice education for faculty and technical staff who participate the IT course in the first year. In addition, we will verify the effect of improving the skills of each faculty member in the off-season until the start of the second year. Furthermore, we will also consider whether the cyber security skills of the entire technical college have improved in the fiscal year. This year, we are proceeding with the project for the second year. In the second year, based on the results of the first year, we will evaluate, consider and examine for the improvement of the educational content toward the third year, which is the completion year. The evaluation includes the validity of the schedule. We also achieved a certain level of success in the development of teaching materials. This project is in good condition for the continuation of the plan and consideration of new items for the next year and after next year. In this paper, we report on the process of building this sustainable and effective cybersecurity education methodology suitable for KOSEN faculty and staff, and thus for students. Cyber Range.

Wireless Cybersecurity Education: A Focus on Curriculum. Higher education is increasingly called upon to enhance cyber education, including hands-on  experiential training. The good news is that additional tools and techniques are becoming more available, both in-house and through third parties, to provide cyber training environments and simulations at various features and price points. However, the training thus far has only focused on  traditional Cybersecurity that lightly touches on wireless in undergraduate and master's degree programs, and certifications. The purpose of this research is to identify and recognize nascent cyber training emphasizing a broader spectrum of wireless security and encourage curricular development that includes critical experiential training. Experiential wireless security training is important to keep pace with the growth in wireless communication mediums and associated Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical System (CPS) applications.

Proactive measures to mitigate cyber security challenges in IoT based smart healthcare networks.The wide range of applications and advantages offered by the Internet of Things has attracted every sector to deploy it in their environment to exploit its advantages. The deployment of devices manufactured by different manufacturers in an Internet of Things environment has also opened the doors for threat actors to launch variety of attacks by exploiting the vulnerabilities present in these devices. The miniaturized size of most of the devices offers a very less space to incorporate the security elements. Healthcare sector has greatly benefited from the growth of Internet of Things. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the role of Smart Healthcare applications in the future. Deployment of life saving devices with limited security features make them one of the critical sector that needs more attention. The impact of a vulnerability exploited in smart healthcare devices can even be life damaging. In this work, the security challenges faced by smart health devices are analyzed and the necessary measures to be taken to improve the security are suggested. Attack. Healthcare.

A hypothesis testing tool for the comparison of different cyber-security mitigation strategies in IoT.Internet of Things (IoT) is a field with tremendous growth that already shows great impact in numerous domains. Simultaneous with this development is the need for better Cyber-security: IoT systems are attacked by various adversaries targeting IoT services, platforms and networks, which can have disruptive consequences. These attacks can be countered using multiple strategies with different effects to the system. The following paper, proposes a novel approach based on Machine Learning and Statistical Hypothesis Testing, which allows the security operator to investigate how using different strategies affects various KPI related to the security of the IoT network and if the KPI resulting from modifications to a mitigation strategy are statistically different when compared to those occurring from a starting mitigation action set.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for aviation cybersecurity: An overview.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications are currently found across all engineering domains, including cybersecurity engineering. This paper presents an overview of the AI-systems and technologies that can greatly benefit the security domain and its potential solutions for the aviation industry: anomaly detection for avionics, securing data link communications, and security certification, among others. As showcased in the National Strategy for Aviation Security report in December 2018 and the U.S. Government Accountability Office report Aviation Cybersecurity in October 2020, there is a need for resilient cybersecurity practices and approaches to address the current issues that aviation faces today. Designing and implementing solutions to address these issues without exploring the feasibility of harnessing AI-powered cybersecurity tools would overlook the potential advantages these technologies can offer. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a roadmap to adapt well-known ML-cybersecurity approaches to aviation security engineering and airworthiness: (i) autonomous and semi-autonomous cybersecurity for autonomous flight operations security, (ii) game theory models for adversarial and uncertainty modeling, (iii) human-AI interfaces for airport security monitoring and decision-making assistance, (iv) predictive analytics for anomaly detection for avionics and e-enabled aircraft, and (v) AI-based reasoning trustworthiness for software reliability and security certification. This paper also presents the challenges of including AI-cybersecurity in the aviation ecosystem to ground the proposed solutions within an accepted set of industry regulations, such as design verification for AI/ML algorithms and certification specifications for AI/ML solutions for manufacturers and agencies.
Game Theoretical Model for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment of Industrial Control Systems.Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS) use advanced computing, sensors, control systems, and communication networks to monitor and control industrial processes and distributed assets. The increased connectivity of these systems to corporate networks has exposed them to new security threats and made them a prime target for cyber-Attacks with the potential of causing catastrophic economic, social, and environmental damage. Recent intensified sophisticated attacks on these systems have stressed the importance of methodologies and tools to assess the security risks of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). In this paper, we propose a novel game theory model and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the cybersecurity risks of an exemplary industrial control system under realistic assumptions. We present five game enrollments where attacker and defender agents make different preferences and we analyze the final outcome of the game. Results show that a balanced defense with uniform budget spending is the best strategy against a look-Ahead attacker.
Evaluating the Use of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) for Cybersecurity Systems. Technology readiness levels (TRLs) are used to evaluate and convey the readiness status of aerospace technologies for mission use. The TRL system was pioneered by NASA. however, the European Union and other U.S. federal agencies-including the United States departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Energy-have also developed related systems. This paper proposes the use of a cybersecurity capability readiness level system to assess and characterize the readiness status of cybersecurity systems for use. It discusses the existing readiness level systems as well as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model, comparing and contrasting them. A new system, based on the TRL system, is proposed and its levels are defined and discussed. aerospace. cybersecurity. maturity. technology readiness level. TRL 
Offensive Cyber Security Trainer for Platform Management Systems.To protect its platforms against cyber attacks, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) must train specialists in platform cyber security. These specialists will need to understand the offensive capabilities of their adversaries in order to defend these platforms and to develop more secure systems. As a result, these specialists will require an environment which can facilitate training in offensive cyber security techniques. Currently, no cyber security trainer exists for the RCN's Platform Management Systems (PMS), nor does one exist for any of the RCN's other platform systems.The aim of this research is to develop a PMS environment based on effective training techniques and capable of training RCN personnel in offensive cyber techniques. Effective training techniques in this context will reflect best practices from pedagogical literature. The training environment in this case is an offensive cyber security trainer which facilitates the training of personnel to execute cyber kill chains mapped from real attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures. Training cyber defenders to perform these kill chains will provide them with a greater understanding of how attacks can be executed against RCN platform systems. This in turn will enable the RCN to better defend against such kill chains.In order to accomplish this aim, an offensive cyber security trainer for a PMS is developed which utilizes a combination of simulation, emulation, and virtualization to provide an effective level of control and flexibility while also maintaining a high level of realism. This training also specifically leverages a Capture the Flag (CTF) framework to enhance personnel engagement within the environment. The functionality of this trainer is demonstrated by its ability to facilitate the training program and the execution of multiple kill chains against the PMS. The effectiveness of the trainer is validated on its application of current research methodology in effective gamified training environment design.

Cybersecurity of Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Management Systems.In concept, a smart charging management system (SCMS) optimizes the charging of plug-in vehicles (PEVs) and provides various grid services including voltage control, frequency regulation, peak shaving, renewable energy integration support, spinning reserve, and emergency demand response. These functionalities largely depend upon data collected from various entities such as PEVs, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), service providers, and utilities. SCMS can be susceptible to both cyber and physical threats (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack, data intrigued attack, denial of charging, physical-attack) due to interactions of and interdependencies between cyber and physical components. Cyber-physical threats through highly connected malware vectors raise various concerns including public safety hazards to vehicle operators and those in the immediate vicinity as well as disruptions to electric grid operations. This paper describes the concept of SCMS and provides a comprehensive review of cybersecurity aspects of EVSEs and SCMSs with their possible impacts on the power grid and society. It also contributes to the development of cybersecurity measures to the SCMSs. Various functions of SCMS are reviewed in detail including peak shaving, demand charge reduction, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, renewable integration support, distribution congestion management, reactive power compensation, and emergency demand response with unidirectional PEVs charging. Also, a critical literature survey on current practices of SCMS cybersecurity is provided to explore major impacts and challenges of cyber-physical attacks and to identify research gaps and vulneraibilities in currently available SCMSs technologies. cyber-physical threats.

A Convenient Machine Learning Model for Cyber Security.In recent years, deep neural network approaches have been generally embraced for AI undertakings, including characterization. Nonetheless, they were demonstrated to be helpless against antagonistic assaults. This research work proposes a GAN based model, another system that utilizes the expressive ability of generative models to protect profound neural organizations against such assaults. Security assaults are getting progressively predominant as digital aggressors abuse framework vulnerabilities for monetary benefit. The digital interruptions imperil our gadgets constantly, they have numerous extreme results, for example, the unapproved divulgement of data, the altering, decimation, and expungement of information. Consequently, unsupervised and viable identification is required to react to these malevolent interruptions against systems and PCs. Many investigations have been finished with both measurable learning strategies and neural networks. Present day arranged frameworks are getting enormous measured and dynamic. Therefore, existing security models experience the ill effects of adaptability issue, where it gets infeasible to utilize them for present day arranged frameworks that contain hundreds and thousands of hosts and vulnerabilities. The objective of this examination is to build up a repeatable procedure to distinguish digital assaults that is quick, exact, and adaptable. The procedure ought to assess various information sources so as to increase a far-reaching image of client action over different frameworks. Client action designs experience typical changes for the duration of the day, and frequently those examples contrast from designs that happen on ends of the week. The model is required to separate between typical changes and anomalous client exercises. A profound learning calculation is utilized to prepare a neural system to distinguish suspicious client exercises. Anomaly Detection. Cyber Security. Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN).

A Survey on Cyber Security Attacks and Countermeasures in Smart Grid Metering Network.Smart grid (SG) network is one of the recently improved networks of tangled entities, objects, and smart metering infrastructure (SMI). It plays a vital part in sensing, acquiring, observing, aggregating, controlling, and dealing with various kinds of fields in SG. The SMI or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is proposed to make available a real-time transmissions connection among users and services are Time of use (TOU), Real time pricing (RTP), Critical Peak Pricing (CPP). In adding to, additional benefit of SMs is which are capable to report back to the service control center in near real time nontechnical losses (for instance, tampering with meters, bypassing meters, and illicit tapping into distribution systems). SMI supports two-way transmission meters reading electrical utilization at superior frequency. This data is treated in real time and signals send to manage demand. This paper expresses a transitory impression of cyberattack instances in customary energy networks and SMI. This paper presents cyber security attacks and countermeasures in Smart Grid Metering Network (SGMN). Based on the existing survey threat models, a number of proposed ways have been planned to deal with all threats in the formulation of the secrecy and privacy necessities of SG measurement network.

When machine learning meets hardware cybersecurity: Delving into accurate zero-day malware detection.Cybersecurity for the past decades has been in the front line of global attention as a critical threat to the information technology infrastructures. According to recent security reports, malicious software (a.k.a. malware) is rising at an alarming rate in numbers as well as harmful purposes to compromise security of computing systems. To address the high complexity and computational overheads of conventional software-based detection techniques, Hardware-Supported Malware Detection (HMD) has proved to be efficient for detecting malware at the processors' microarchitecture level with the aid of Machine Learning (ML) techniques applied on Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) data. Existing ML-based HMDs while accurate in recognizing known signatures of malicious patterns, have not explored detecting unknown (zero-day) malware data at run-time which is a more challenging problem, since its HPC data does not match any known attack applications' signatures in the existing database. In this work, we first present a review of recent ML-based HMDs utilizing built-in HPC registers information. Next, we examine the suitability of various standard ML classifiers for zero-day malware detection and demonstrate that such methods are not capable of detecting unknown malware signatures with high detection rate. Lastly, to address the challenge of run-time zero-day malware detection, we propose an ensemble learning-based technique to enhance the performance of the standard malware detectors despite using a small number of microarchitectural features that are captured at run-time by existing HPCs. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach by applying AdaBoost ensemble learning on Random Forrest classifier as a regular classifier achieves 92% F-measure and 95% TPR with only 2% false positive rate in detecting zero-day malware using only the top 4 microarchitectural features.
A Review of Cyber Security Assessment (CSA) for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Their Impact on the Availability of the ICS Operation.The equipment in industries in this digital age is controlled by systems connected via internet either wired or wireless connectivity. This technology is demanded in almost all organizations to perform their daily industrial operations. Hence, the system must run without any failure and the rate of system availability is a priority. Most importantly, the entire system must be secured from cyber security threats, vulnerability, and risks so as to ensure that the system is not exposed to the possibility of any cyber attack. Thus, initial security assessment must be conducted to ensure the security aspect of the system. Nevertheless, the evaluation shall not impact the system's regular operations. As such, the study reviews and discusses the Cyber Security Assessment (CSA) for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and their possible effect on the availability of ICS operations.
Cybersecurity Metrics for Automotive Systems. Cybersecurity for automotive systems is challenging, and one of the major challenges is how to measure this specific system property. With the increased need for cybersecurity in automotive systems due to the development of more advanced technologies and corresponding increased threat vectors, coupled with the upcoming International Organization for Standardization and the Society for Automotive Engineers (ISO/SAE) 21434 cybersecurity standard for automotive systems and cybersecurity regulations in The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (UNECE WP.29), it is becoming increasingly important for auto manufacturers and suppliers to have a clear and common understanding and agreement of cybersecurity metrics for the development and deployment of vehicles. The main contribution of this article is the contextualization of existing metrics from literature and mapping out how they may fit within a standardized framework. We highlight the challenges to create awareness around the lack of common understanding and outline the first potential steps towards a consensus. For example, one can consider assurance levels as a form of metric. Since guarantees of security are not possible, verification and validation methods such as various forms of testing can be used to give an assurance of security. For the automotive industry, there are discussions around cybersecurity assurance levels (CALs), which are outlined in an informative annex in the ISO/SAE 21434 draft standard. The CAL values are used to indicate subsequently the increasing scope, extent, and depth of assurance activities to be performed to achieve that level of assurance. A common understanding of the answer to  how much cybersecurity is enough? will inspire greater confidence in practitioners who design and test the technical measures, in the industry as regards a balanced approach to cybersecurity and ultimately, in consumers who need to know that the products that they buy will be safe and secure.
Enterprise Architecture Frameworks Assessment: Capabilities, Cyber Security and Resiliency Review. Recent technological advancement demands organizations to have measures in place to manage their Information Technology (IT) systems. Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAF) offer companies an efficient technique to manage their IT systems aligning their business requirements with effective solutions. As a result, experts have developed multiple EAF's such as TOGAF, Zachman, MoDAF, DoDAF, SABSA to help organizations to achieve their objectives by reducing the costs and complexity. These frameworks however, concentrate mostly on business needs lacking holistic enterprise-wide security practices, which may cause enterprises to be exposed for significant security risks resulting financial loss. This study focuses on evaluating business capabilities in TOGAF, NIST, COBIT, MoDAF, DoDAF, SABSA, and Zachman, and identify essential security requirements in TOGAF, SABSA and COBIT19 frameworks by comparing their resiliency processes, which helps organization to easily select applicable framework. The study shows that. besides business requirements, EAF need to include precise cybersecurity guidelines aligning EA business strategies. Enterprises now need to focus more on building resilient approach, which is beyond of protection, detection and prevention. Now enterprises should be ready to withstand against the cyber-attacks applying relevant cyber resiliency approach improving the way of dealing with impacts of cybersecurity risks. capabilities. cyber security requirement. cybersecurity.

Integrating Fuzz Testing into the Cybersecurity Validation Strategy.Automotive systems have become increasingly more complex, interconnected and prone to cyberattacks in recent years. With larger software bases and multiple external communication interfaces, the risks for new vulnerabilities and attack vectors on vehicles also increase. Therefore, modern cybersecurity validation is highly stressed for finding security vulnerabilities and robustness issues early and systematically at every stage of the product development process. The integration of a sophisticated fuzz testing program within the overall cybersecurity validation strategy allows for accommodating towards these challenging demands. In this paper, we review a general automotive cybersecurity engineering process containing functional testing, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, and highlight shortcomings that can be complemented by fuzz testing. We present how fuzz testing is not only beneficial to improve product security directly by detecting weaknesses, but also indirectly by providing input to allow enhancing other testing activities. Finally, we provide a suggestion for an updated cybersecurity engineering process, which gives guidance on when fuzz testing should be performed and how fuzz testing should interface with other testing activities. Our approach is compliant to the ISO/SAE DIS 21434 cybersecurity engineering process. The approach uses Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) together with Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs) for the systematic identification of high-priority attack vectors and assignment of testing priorities. With this knowledge, it is possible to decide where, when and how often fuzz testing shall be applied for both finding unknown vulnerabilities and regressions in an automatized manner. This approach identifies issues earlier and with greater coverage than functional testing, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing could achieve on their own. As a result, by following this approach, the overall cybersecurity engineering process is more comprehensive, security remediation costs are lower, and resources for manual activities such as penetration testing are used more efficiently.
Measurable challenges in smart grid cybersecurity enhancement: A brief review.This paper aims to provide a brief summary of measurable factors affecting the adoption of cybersecurity enhancement techniques. From the practicality perspective, it is important to know that 'to what degree' the cyber resilience will be improved by adopting a resilience enhancement scheme that requires a certain amount of financial investment. Numerous strategies have been proposed in different sets of literature to make smart grids more resilient against cyber attack. In this paper, the recent proposed techniques published within the past few years are further discussed in terms of three measurable factors including accuracy, computational time, and robustness with an emphasis on false data injection attacks. There is no single solution that would fit all needs in the power industry. Therefore, recently proposed attack detection and recognition schemes are compared and discussed quantitatively.

A Process to Facilitate Automated Automotive Cybersecurity Testing.Modern vehicles become increasingly digitalized with advanced information technology-based solutions like advanced driving assistance systems and vehicle-to-x communications. These systems are complex and interconnected. Rising complexity and increasing outside exposure has created a steadily rising demand for more cyber-secure systems. Thus, also standardization bodies and regulators issued standards and regulations to prescribe more secure development processes. This security, however, also has to be validated and verified. In order to keep pace with the need for more thorough, quicker and comparable testing, today's generally manual testing processes have to be structured and optimized. Based on existing and emerging standards for cybersecurity engineering, this paper therefore outlines a structured testing process for verifying and validating automotive cybersecurity, for which there is no standardized method so far. Despite presenting a commonly structured framework, the process is flexible in order to allow implementers to utilize their own, accustomed toolsets. Automotive. Cybersecurity. Process. Security.

Raising Security Awareness Using Cybersecurity Challenges in Embedded Programming Courses.Security bugs are errors in code that, when exploited, can lead to serious software vulnerabilities. These bugs could allow an attacker to take over an application and steal information. One of the ways to address this issue is by means of awareness training. The Sifu platform was developed in the industry, for the industry, with the aim to raise software developers' awareness of secure coding. This paper extends the Sifu platform with three challenges that specifically address embedded programming courses, and describes how to implement these challenges, while also evaluating the usefulness of these challenges to raise security awareness in an academic setting. Our work presents technical details on the detection mechanisms for software vulnerabilities and gives practical advice on how to implement them. The evaluation of the challenges is performed through two trial runs with a total of 16 participants. Our preliminary results show that the challenges are suitable for academia, and can even potentially be included in official teaching curricula. One major finding is an indicator of the lack of awareness of secure coding by undergraduates. Finally, we compare our results with previous work done in the industry and extract advice for practitioners. cybersecurity challenge. education. embedded programming. secure coding. security bug. software quality. training 
Cyber Security in Digital Sector.the term Cyber security usually refers to high tech, procedures, and usage anticipated that are intended to preserve networks, devices, programs, and information from assault, damage, or illegal access. Cyber security may also refer to as information technology. Cyber security is important because numerous bodies function with the help of security itself and, then the role of cyber security comes into play. An important section of that information can be sensitive information, whether that is logical possessions, monetary data, individual information, or other types of data for which not permitted access or understanding could have distrustful consequences. Organizations intend to transmit responsive data athwart networks and to other stratagem in the route of doing businesses, and also cyber security that depict the restraint devoted to shielding the information and systems that are used to procedure or collect it.

Behavior control-based approach to influencing user's cybersecurity actions using mobile news app.In this paper, we propose that the theory of planned behavior (TPB) with the additional factors of awareness and context-based information can be used to positively influence users' cybersecurity behavior. A research model based on TPB is developed and validated using a user study. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a mobile cybersecurity news app that incorporates context-based information such as location, search history, and usage information of other mobile apps into its article recommendations and warning notifications to address user awareness better. Through a survey of 100 participants, the proposed research model was validated, and it was confirmed that context-based information positively influences users' awareness in cybersecurity.
Use of augmented reality-enabled prototyping of cyber-physical systems for improving cyber-security education.The use of augmented reality-enabled scenarios in cybersecurity teaching is proposed in the article to respond to new requirements for the rapid adoption of new technologies and profound knowledge of cybersecurity issues by professionals. Implementation of project-type activities based on real cybersecurity issues in application fields of cyber-physical systems is suggested to improve the competence forming. A use-case of agricultural cyber-physical system of systems is discussed as a viable example of augmented reality-enabled prototyping of cybersecurity risk-aware architecture. The necessary steps are analysis of general and business-specific tasks on cybersecurity, creation of a list of competencies, formalized in educational standards and curricula, development of gaming scenarios for the formation of hard and soft skills, development of the scenario management system for AR interfaces. The system using AR tools can be easily adapted to different cybersecurity training activities. Industrial cyber-physical systems may be vulnerable due to insecure wireless connectivity, lack of encryption, inadequate access policy. The project-based learning complex is focused on the implementation of a data acquisition, storage and processing platform for new sensor networks and instruments. Representing all the diverse information on different layers will be greatly improved by use of the developed holographic projection AR tools.
The concept of preventive cybersecurity management of the IoT device market in the digital economy.In the context of the digital transformation of the society and its infrastructure, the problem of cybersecurity of its digital resources and structural elements of digital life systems is acute. DDoS attacks make up a significant part of cyber threats, while the tendencies for their improvement are such that in the context of the development of advanced (innovative) technologies the hacker communities widely use IoT devices as a source for computer attacks on elements of the digital infrastructure of the society.

Cybersecurity challenges during pandemic in smart cities.This paper focuses on the Cybersecurity challenges faced by smart cities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic still there, cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups have taken advantage of attacking intelligent cities worldwide. This research primarily focuses on a correspondence between the increase in the attacks on different cyber-sectors in smart cities and the ongoing pandemic. When people are still adjusting to the new norm of working from home (WFH) and online classes, there had been many cases of cyber criminals trying to taking over some popular video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, and Google meet. Hijacking the sessions and displaying their agenda or demands are among the attacks which Cybercriminals have mounted on these platforms. There is a genuine concern regarding the cybersecurity of smart cities with the rise of cyber threats during the Corona virus pandemic. This paper studies the increase of cyber threats and issues on smart cities globally in the ongoing pandemic and different ways to confront them using technologies like Blockchain, Internet of Things, Software-defined networks, Artificial Intelligence, and data-driven security concepts.

Ontology-based approach for cybersecurity recruitment.Human resource management is the strategic approach to effectively managing people in a business or organization so that their business contributes to gaining competitive advantage. Many human resource management tasks are based on finding and matching individuals to positions. In this paper an ontology-based approach is presented for effectively matching job seekers and job positions over multiple criteria by making use of different skills ontologies, for discovering a set of profiles that best fits the job description criteria and ranking applicants. The general architecture of the framework is outlined and ontologies operations are described.
Attended-over Distributed Specificity for Information Extraction in Cybersecurity.Cybersecurity has become a critical necessity in aerospace, especially given the recent prevalent utilization of cyberspace as well as computing infrastructure, tools, and platforms in the domain. Cybersecurity relies on the timely discovery of potential and active vulnerabilities to mitigate threats, cyberattacks and theft of intellectual property. These vulnerabilities are commonly communicated via textual channels which can be mined and detected by information extraction techniques, such as Automatic Terminology Extraction (ATE), in order to mitigate imminent and future attacks. Distributed Specificity, a modern and highly effective ATE paradigm, was first introduced by [4], [3] and further improved by [21]. These methods, however, regard the context words linearly and indiscriminately, which 1) disregards the non-linear relations among the context words and 2) assigns an equal weight to each word edge in the sequence despite the fact that the connections of the nodes are not of equal strength. As our first contribution, the present article addresses this shortcoming by integrating the self-attention mechanism into the distributed specificity paradigm to enhance candidate terms' representation resulting in a more accurate extraction, which in turn lends itself to the higher coverage and a more timely discovery of cyberattacks. Since no ATE dataset exists in the cybersecurity domain, to the best of our knowledge, the present endeavor offers a dataset, as its second contribution, that will be the benchmark for our experiments and the ones to follow by both ATE and cybersecurity research communities. This complements the SemEval's SecureNLP [35] information extraction repository. We extend the MalwareTextDB (comprised of 147 cybersecurity reports) to include labeled terminologies as ground truth. The labeled dataset is annotated by cybersecurity practitioners using Term Evaluator [25]. Although for most industries higher coverage and a more timely discovery of cyberthreats will translate into protecting vital data, customer privacy, and sizable funds to name but a few advantages, in aerospace the risk and therefore the reward may be much higher directly resulting in saving human lives in both small and large scales.
Named Entity Recognition Using BERT with Whole World Masking in Cybersecurity Domain.Nowadays the amount of cybersecurity data grows quickly on the Internet, however most of them are textual unstructured data, which is hard for security analysis to understand in time and is not suitable for automated security systems to directly use. The automated and real-Time switching of cybersecurity information from unstructured text sources to structured representations can help the cyber threat intelligence analysis know the cyber situation better. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is able to convert unstructured data into structured data. Recently, a language representation model named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has achieved great improvements among different NLP tasks. In this paper, we apply BERT and its improved version BERT with whole world masking (BERTwwm) to the NER task for cybersecurity. We combine the BERT model with the BiLSTM-CRF architecture, and the experiment reveals that our method achieves greater performance on the precision, recall, and F1 score compared with the state-of-The-Art model whether on the overall entity or single entity.

To Gamify or Not?: On Leaderboard Effects, Student Engagement and Learning Outcomes in a Cybersecurity Intervention. We present a gamified learning experience for cybersecurity education that is designed to provide learners with an understanding of the knowledge and techniques needed to solve everyday problems while simultaneously immersing them in a competitive environment. We provide a framework for measuring skills demonstrated by students within an active learning setting where the primary focus is on practical expertise. We also examine several unique aspects of designing such a gamified framework (e.g. the game itself must be insecure enough to be  hackable , but secure enough not to be abused), and discuss how the framework was used to expose students to various security concepts. We found that our gamified experience heavily engaged students. We also encountered many pain points during our intervention and discovered a number of important aspects of gamified settings that must be carefully considered. For one, the goals of a semi-structured gamified exercise can sometimes lead to learners discovering solutions that do not meet the desired learning objectives. Furthermore, The exploratory nature of such exercises can also lead learners down a rabbit hole that, without a proper  safety net , they may not exit. Finally, complex tasks modeled after real world applications can leave little room for error, frustrating students and limiting instructors' ability to accurately assess different levels of skill. Based on our experience designing this intervention, we provide a number of transferable recommendations. The challenges we faced and the lessons we learned can be invaluable to those considering gamification as a cybersecurity education strategy. active learning. cybersecurity education. gamification

Attack Surface Assessment for Cybersecurity Engineering in the Automotive Domain.Connected smart cars enable new attacks that may have serious consequences. Thus, the development of new cars must follow a cybersecurity engineering process as defined for example in ISO/SAE 21434. A central part of such a process is the threat and risk assessment including an attack feasibility rating. In this paper, we present an attack surface assessment with focus on the attack feasibility rating compliant to ISO/SAE 21434. We introduce a reference architecture with assets constituting the attack surface, the attack feasibility rating for these assets, and the application of this rating on typical use cases. The attack feasibility rating assigns attacks and assets to an evaluation of the attacker dimensions such as the required knowledge and the feasibility of attacks derived from it. Our application of sample use cases shows how this rating can be used to assess the feasibility of an entire attack path. The attack feasibility rating can be used as a building block in a threat and risk assessment according to ISO/SAE 21434. attack feasibility rating. automotive security.

Traffic Analysis in Support of Hybrid SDN Campus Architectures for Enhanced Cybersecurity.The scale and complexity of campus networks continues to accelerate due to recent paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) resulting in a heightened awareness of the need for enhanced cybersecurity. Traditional cybersecurity approaches such as the placement of firewalls and other policy enforcement mechanisms at strategic choke points effectively divide the network into zones and are unable to regulate intrazone host-to-host communication. This traditional approach introduces significant risk as there is little in place to prevent the horizontal propagation of malware or other unwanted traffic within a given zone. In this paper we explore approaches for improving cybersecurity in campus networks by analyzing contemporary campus traffic patterns and propose several architectural enhancements in light of these patterns which introduce strategically placed hardware or hardware-accelerated software data planes which are evaluated from performance and effectiveness perspectives. campus network architecture. cybersecurity 
SafeMan: A unified framework to manage cybersecurity and safety in manufacturing industry.Industrial control systems (ICS) are considered cyber-physical systems that join both cyber and physical worlds. Due to their tight interaction, where humans and robots co-work and co-inhabit in the same workspaces and production lines, cyber-attacks targeting ICS can alter production processes and even bypass safety procedures. As an example, these cyber-attacks could interrupt physical industrial processes and cause potential injuries to workers. In this article, we present SafeMan, a unified management framework based on the Edge Computing paradigm that provides high-performance applications for the detection and mitigation of both cyber-attacks and safety threats in industrial scenarios. Three use cases show specific threats in manufacturing as well as the SafeMan actions carried out to detect and mitigate them. In order to validate our proposal, a pool of experiments was performed with Electra, an industrial dataset with normal network traffic and different cyber-attacks by using a given number of Modbus TCP and S7Comm devices. The experiments measured the runtime performance of anomaly detection techniques based on machine learning and deep learning to detect cyber-attacks in control networks.

Using deep learning for assessing cybersecurity economic risks in virtual power plants. This paper presents an assessment procedure for evaluating economic risks in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) using two deep learning techniques, viz., Naïve Bayes algorithm and J48 bagging tree model. A comprehensive matrix of cybersecurity economic assessment based on threats, motives, impacts, challenges and economic impacts is provided in this paper. Cybersecurity risk quantification and their measurement and Cyber risk mitigation frameworks are also dealt with in this paper. Our cybersecurity risk Return On Security Investment (ROSI) model employs 9-parameters, while our dataset collection is classified into 11 types of attack profiles. The results obtained from Naïve Bayes classifier and CRQ using J48 bagging tree model yield a predictor accuracy of 82%, while the classifier correctly classifies instances in Naïve Bayes with a Receiver-Operator-Characteristic (ROC) area of 0.940 indicating the good classification of the sampled data. the prediction rate is 94.2% for the CRQ-J48. The ROC curve for the naïve Bayes classifier performs its best when the data is at 80% and performs worse when at 10%. Similarly, the J48 performs best when the data is at 85%-90% and worse between 5%-10%. While examining the cost of the data breach of a single instance of compromise, it can be estimated that web server has the maximum exposure and hence the cost of a breach is approximately estimated to be around 19 million dollars in our dataset.

Cyber-Hero: A Gamification framework for Cyber Security Awareness for High Schools Students.People are considered the weakest point in the information systems which causes most of the cyber-attacks successful. The increasing numbers of cyber-attacks indicate that the traditional methodologies of training and awareness are still insufficient to build the necessary cybersecurity skills and capabilities. Gamification represents a promising methodology to change the behavior of people in the early stages. The objective of this research is not only to verify the effectiveness of gamification but also to provide a constructive application and to propose a framework that helps eventually and iteratively in improving the cyber-security skills and capabilities for high school students in early stages. In this research, we propose a novel framework for information security awareness and training programs, known as Cyber-Hero, that will help fight one of the most popular weaknesses in cybersecurity which is human error. The framework helps in transferring the learning of a narrative set of instructions to be acquired in a serious game, in which students in schools can engage with at an early stage. Such an engagement will educate students on how to create a strong password to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. The preliminary results show incremental progress in the skills and capabilities of cybersecurity for the students using the proposed framework. Awareness Campaign. Cybersecurity Exercises.

Cyber-security Enhancement of Smart Grid's Substation Using Object's Distance Estimation in Surveillance Cameras.Cyber-attacks toward cyber-physical systems are one of the main concerns of smart grid's operators. However, many of these cyber-attacks, are toward unmanned substations where the cyber-attackers needs to be close enough to substation to malfunction protection and control systems in substations, using Electromagnetic signals. Therefore, in this paper, a new threat detection algorithm is proposed to prevent possible cyber-attacks toward unmanned substations. Using surveillance camera's streams and based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) V3, suspicious objects in the image are detected. Then, using Intersection over Union (IOU) and Generalized Intersection Over Union (GIOU), threat distance is estimated. Finally, the estimated threats are categorized into three categories using color codes red, orange and green. The deep network used for detection consists of 106 convolutional layers and three output prediction with different resolutions for different distances. The pre-trained network is transferred from Darknet-53 weights trained on 80 classes. cyber-security. fully convolutional deep network. risk assessment. threat detection. YOLO

Resilient Cyber-Security Approach for Aviation Cyber-Physical Systems Protection against Sensor Spoofing Attacks.The aviation industries are transitioning from conventional aircraft systems to Aviation Cyber-Physical Systems (ACPS) based aircraft. However, like any Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the ACPS are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can be mounted by adversaries through the communication network infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel and resilient security protocol for detecting and defending ACPS against sensor spoofing cyber-attacks. First, a communication environment was developed to establish an aircraft Networked Control System (NCS) using the SimEvents toolbox. Then, a cyber-attack detection algorithm based on the positive selection of the Artificial Immune System (AIS) approach was developed and used to detect and drop suspicious communication packets on the aircraft network traffic. Finally, the NCS and the detection algorithm were integrated and tested on real cyber-security attack scenarios. The algorithm's accuracy was 0.96 based on the True Positive and True Negative algorithm detection rate. For further defending the aircraft against cyber-attacks, Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) algorithm was developed to reconstruct or estimate the network dropped packets. The estimation accuracy of the NARX reached 0.99 using the coefficient of determination (R-value) based on the linear regression approach. The real-time simulation test results showed that the sensor spoofing cyber-attack was successfully detected. Also, the communication network of the ACPS was defended against the attack because the ACPS was maintaining the normal performance during the course of the cyber-attack. ACPS.

External Auditors' Assessments of Cyber-Security Risks.The mushrooming occurrences of cyber criminals in the recent years have provoked an alarm about the drawback of technological growth and the increasing dependence of human beings on technology. The severity of this situation in the business world is even greater and greater than other fields, which leads many people raise a question about the response of external auditors-the ones who are responsible for detecting any accounting faults-towards cybersecurity-attacked companies-the ones which can try their best to hide their difficulties from their investors and stakeholders. Hence, this study investigates whether external auditors pay more attention to cybersecurity-attacked companies by applying higher audit fee charges. Using a sample of 100 global small, medium and large companies, the study has found out that there is a positive relationship between audit fees and breach, which means that external auditors find more risks and exert more efforts when auditing the cybersecurity-attacked companies.

Novel Authentication Mechanisms for Hash Code, CAPTCHA and OTP in Cyber Security Domain.The cyber world can be secured only through the systematic development of security measures for both system to network security. It cannot be achieved through haphazard seat-of-the-pants methods. Every system developed by an organization demands a layer of security for its' safe functioning. This security layer is built by various techniques to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational systems. As an entry point of the security layer, authentication mechanisms play a crucial role. The organizations provide user access to the services and systems by using various authentication mechanisms namely, hash code, CAPTCHA, and OTP. If such entry points are made strong, the systems and networks can be protected well from unauthorized intrusions. This article focuses on developing novel authentication mechanisms for hash code, CAPTCHA, and OTP, which tightens the authentication mechanisms of cybersecurity.

Curriculum to Broaden Participation in Cybersecurity for Middle School Teachers and Students.To both broaden and increase participation in any STEM field such as cybersecurity, we need to attract more students. Research shows that to do this, students need to be engaged with cybersecurity during middle school. There is a lack of age-appropriate and classroom-ready cybersecurity curriculum, however, and many teachers feel unprepared to teach the subject. To address this gap, the CyberMiSTS project team created a summer professional development workshop for middle school teachers that integrated a recent research-based understanding of cybersecurity into a curriculum that is accessible to both middle school students and their teachers. The project sought to encourage participation of a broad and diverse set of students in the field of cybersecurity by showing them how human relations play an important role in cybersecurity. We discuss our prior related work using branching web comics to introduce middle school students to cybersecurity concepts and careers, and the state of evidence-based research into effective approaches and methods for cybersecurity education. We identify challenges to broadening the pipeline for a truly diverse cybersecurity workforce that can meet industry's need for cybersecurity professionals with a wide range of experience and skills. The paper introduces our approach for the teacher professional development workshop, maps how we designed the project to meet our research goals, and documents initial findings regarding what is needed to increase teacher self-efficacy about cybersecurity concepts and careers in a middle school classroom. careers. cybersecurity education.

A Voice Assistant for IoT Cybersecurity.The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming more pervasive in the home, office, hospital, and many other userfacing environments (UFEs) as more devices are networked to improve functionality. However, this explosion of networked devices in UFEs necessitates that security systems become easier to help users remain aware of the security of the devices on their network. Users may not have the skills or the time needed to continuously monitor networks of increasing complexity using common open-source tools. Specifically, they are not likely to fully comprehend the data that those tools present, nor are they likely to have a working knowledge of the tools needed to monitor and protect their IoT-enabled network environments. This paper explores development of a system that uses ambient computing to facilitate network security monitoring and administration. Our system is designed to combine machine-learning-enriched device awareness and dynamic visualization of IoT networks with a natural language query interface enabled by voice assistants to greatly simplify the process of providing awareness of the security state of the network. The voice assistant integrates knowledge of devices on the network to communicate status and concerns in a manner that is easily comprehensible. These capabilities will help to improve the security of UFEs while lowering the associated cognitive load on the users. This paper outlines continued work in progress toward building this capability as well as initial results on the efficacy of the system. Ambient Computing. Cybersecurity. Internet of Things.

Vulnerabilities of Cyber Security of Technical Intelligentsia in Relation to Social Engineering. In the field of cybersecurity, the most critical problems are with the human factor and, in particular, the problem of cyber protection of individual and collective consciousness and subconscious. The objects of cyber defense against social engineering, among others, are the individual and collective consciousness and the subconscious. Uncontrolled influences of social networks can have serious consequences for civilization and culture. The causes of vulnerabilities are the peculiarities of the functioning of social networks and the processes of information perception and thinking. Information technology and objective factors of thought processes turned out to be unprotected. Due to the high complexity, some of our models of reality are not based on knowledge, but on faith. The rest of the models can be based on the subconscious. Collective consciousness has certain vulnerabilities due to conflicts. Educated technical intelligentsia falls under some vulnerabilities more than ordinary people. Cognitive distortion  myside bias  forces us to remain faithful to our own worldviews and those of our group. Protection from the trap of distortion is a critical attitude towards yourself and your views. Only this will help us not to get stuck in the  trap of distortion . It must be understood that belief is a conditioned reflex of the mind, a habit, a stereotypical reaction of understanding, an explanation of the situation when a certain stimulus appears. You can work with conditioned reflexes. They can be installed and removed at will. To counteract the automatic reaction and conditioned reflexes, it is recommended to analyze the origin of beliefs, their inconsistency, adequacy and impact on activities. cognitive distortion. collective consciousness. cyber defense.

A Method for Discovering Hidden Patterns of Cybersecurity Knowledge Based on Hierarchical Clustering∗.The construction of cybersecurity knowledge graphs improves the full-dimensional cognitive ability of cyber threats. However, most of the current research on the cybersecurity knowledge graphs focuses on the one-hop or multi-hop correlation queries of knowledge, while ignoring the hidden patterns in the knowledge graphs. Based on the knowledge graph stated in this paper[1], we propose a method for discovering hidden patterns of cybersecurity knowledge based on hierarchical clustering, using the hacker group features of security technologies in the knowledge graph, calculating the distance between the security technology knowledge in the knowledge graph based on the Phicoefficient, and mining cybersecurity technologies that are often used by hacker groups by employing the ward linkage method of hierarchical clustering. The experimental results show that three similar cybersecurity technologies, namely Peripheral Device Discovery, Data from Removable Media and Junk Data, all of which are aimed at stealing or attacking the externally-connected devices of computers, are used by most hacker groups.

In this position paper we outline some of the problems facing machine learning in cybersecurity and argue for a collaborative approach where humans contribute insight and understanding, whilst machines are used to gather, filter and process data into a convenient and understandable form. In turn this requires a convenient representation for exchanging information between machine and human, and we argue that graded concepts are suitable, allowing summarisation at multiple levels of discernibility (granularity). collaborative intelligence.

GRU and Multi-autoencoder based Insider Threat Detection for Cyber Security.The concealment and confusion nature of insider threat makes it a challenging task for security analysts to identify insider threat from log data. To detect insider threat, we propose a novel gated recurrent unit (GRU) and multi-autoencoder based insider threat detection method, which is an unsupervised anomaly detection method. It takes advantage of the extremely unbalanced characteristic of insider threat data and constructs a normal behavior autoencoder with low reconfiguration error through multi-level filter behavior learning, and identifies the behavior data with high reconfiguration error as abnormal behavior. In order to achieve the high efficiency of calculation and detection, GRU and multi-head attention are introduced into the autoencoder. Use dataset v6.2 of the CERT insider threat as validation data and threat detection recall as evaluation metric. The experimental results show that the effect of the proposed method is obviously better than that of Isolation Forest, LSTM autoencoder and multi-channel autoencoders based insider threat detection methods, and it's an effective insider threat detection technology. anomaly detection.

Conscious Machines for Autonomous Agents and Cybersecurity.Although consciousness has been difficult to define, most researchers in artificial intelligence would agree that AI systems to date have not exhibited anything resembling consciousness. But is a conscious machine possible in the near future? I suggest that a new definition of consciousness may provide a basis for developing a conscious machine. The key is pattern recognition of correlated events in time, leading to the identification of a unified self-agent. Such a conscious system can create a simplified virtual environment, revise it to reflect updated sensor inputs, and partition the environment into self, other agents, and relevant objects. It can track recent time sequences of events, predict future events based on models and patterns in memory, and attribute causality to events and agents. It can make rapid decisions based on incomplete data, and can dynamically learn new responses based on appropriate measures of success and failure. The central aspect of consciousness is the generation of a dynamic narrative, a real-time model of a self-agent pursuing goals in a virtual reality. A conscious machine of this type may be implemented using an appropriate neural network linked to episodic memories. Near-term applications may include autonomous vehicles and online agents for cybersecurity. artificial intelligence. autonomous systems. computer security. cyberspace. machine learning. neural networks. pattern recognition. virtual reality

Game Theoretical Dynamic Cybersecurity Defense Strategy for Electrical Cyber Physical Systems.The critical industrial infrastructures are facing increasing cyberspace threats and attacks in most recent years, the cyberspace security of different forms of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) has received much attention. The game theory is considered as an appropriate paradigm for formulating the behaviors of cyberspace attack and defense. This paper proposes a game theory based dynamic cybersecurity defense strategy in the context of electrical CPSs that relies on zero-sum game of incomplete information to identify the expected utility of attacker and defender under Nash equilibrium. The key idea of the proposed solution is to import physical security target and cyber safety index, analyze the asset value of different nodes in a multi-dimensional manner, and update Markov belief dynamically at each stage to reflect the understanding degree of both sides. The proposed solution is assessed through simulation experiments and the CPS testbed at Zhejiang University. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can carry out appropriate strategy for defense resources allocation in electrical CPS with the limited availability of defense resources. cyber attack. electrical cyber-physical system. game theory. multi-dimensional assessment 
Coordination Method of Functional Safety and Cyber Security for Industrial Control Systems.In order to ensure the reliable execution of the functional safety of industrial control systems and effectively resist more and more serious cyber attacks, it is necessary to explore a technical solution suitable for industrial control systems to effectively ensure the compatibility of cyber security and functional security measures. Taking typical SIL3 and SL3 industrial control systems as examples, based on functional safety measures, cyber security measures are analyzed one by one, and potential contradictions between them are identified. Coordination solutions of functional safety and cyber security are given by combining event tree and risk analysis. Finally, integrated protective measures of functional safety and cyber security of industrial control systems are obtained. The results show that the cyber security measures determined by the coordination method are compatible with the original functional safety measures, and the coordination method can be used to guide the cyber security design of industrial control systems. coordination of functional safety and cyber security. cyber security. functional safety.

IoT Cybersecurity: On the Use of Machine Learning Approaches for Unbalanced Datasets.Machine learning can effectively be used to detect cyberattacks in IoT networks by learning patterns from previous attack datasets. Unfortunately, datasets used for training machine learning models to detect cyberattacks are almost always unbalanced. As training methods usually try to minimise the loss function by correctly classifying the instances of the majority class, the minority class instances are more likely to be misclassified. This paper aims to develop an insight into the effectiveness of two different approaches for handling unbalanced datasets - weighted loss function, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) in enhancing the capacity of two machine learning algorithms - artificial neural network (ANN) and light gradient boosting model (LGBM) to correctly classify minority class instances. The results suggest that both SMOTE and weighted loss function enhance the recall rate for minority classes significantly, however, it comes at the cost of slightly reduced precision. Moreover, it is found that LGBM, being an ensemble classifier, has an inherent capacity of learning from unbalanced data and hence, outperforms ANN in detecting minority class instances.

Real-Time Digital Twin of Residential Energy Storage System for Cyber-Security Study.Modern Residential Energy Storage Systems (RESSs) are monitored and controlled using Cloud based Energy Management System (CEMS). Analyzing the cyber-security of such RESSs controlled by CEMS is critical for developing appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems against cyber attacks targeting such RESSs. However, it is impractical and expensive to modify, scale and replicate the physical RESS as per the cyber-security study requirements. This paper presents, a lowcost Real-Time Digital Twin (RTDT) of an interconnected and distributed RESSs controlled and monitored via CEMS. Systematic procedure for the development of RTDT of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is described in detail. The proposed RTDT of a physical RESS test-bed gives flexibility to modify, scale and replicate the system without compromising its real-time fidelity. The development procedure can be easily replicated to develop RTDT of any CPS or micro-grid test-beds. To minimize RTDT development cost, single board computer with Simulink Desktop Real-Time is used instead of using expensive real-time simulators. The CEMS graphical user interface of the RTDT gives flexibility to control interconnected RESSs via the internet cloud. An experimental case study is presented to verify the performance of the RTDT. The RTDT is developed for a commercially available RESS and CEMS, and not for a theoretical system. Cyber-physical system. cyber-security. real-time digital twin. residential energy storage system

Is Your Construction Site Secure? A View From the Cybersecurity Perspective. The construction industry is increasingly using information technologies (IT) and operational technologies (OT) to enhance processes and operations through digitalization. Creating, editing, storing, and sharing information in digital environments is only one side of the coin. the other involves monitoring and controlling physical processes on construction sites. Given the nature of construction sites, where humans and machines/equipment work collaboratively, safety concerns arise. Utilizing interconnected and cyber-physical systems such as (semi)autonomous and remote-controlled machines on-site magnifies the importance of robust cybersecurity. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the threats against each networked equipment, analyze the vulnerabilities, assess the risks, and provide mitigation methods. Cybersecurity frameworks are effective solutions for this purpose. however, they are usually generic and thus require customization to be employed in the construction site environment. Against this background, this paper reviews existing cybersecurity frameworks/standards and selects the most suitable one to implement in the construction environment. The implementation was performed by customizing the selected generic framework considering the needs of a hypothetical construction site that utilizes autonomous earthmoving equipment. For the evaluation, a scoring system that was not included in the original framework was proposed. Given the paucity of studies in this field and lack of cybersecurity awareness in the construction industry, this study aims (1) to raise awareness about the potential cyber threats against construction sites that are increasingly interconnected, (2) to point out the need for a customized cyber assessment method on-site, and (3) help building a security-minded approach within the construction industry.

Cybersecurity Trends and New Challenges for the Space Sector.Referring to the definition provided by the International Telecommunication Union, cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organisation and user’s assets. Having such a large collection defining cybersecurity justifies the large variety and heterogeneity of competences, going from technical skills (e.g. threat intelligence, malware analysis, security operations, etc.) to nontechnical skills (e.g. cyber risk management, governance, education, etc.), required to be prepared against cyber threats. With the increasing number of connected satellite networks, information security has become a top priority for government regulators and companies in the space industry. The lack of specific cybersecurity requirements for the space assets needs to be addressed in order to reduce the potential vulnerability of space-based infrastructures. The growing concern requiring the identification and deployment of relevant cybersecurity measures and solutions in the space sector, is also reflected in the new release of the ESA Technology Tree (v 4.0 - April 2020), which has included new technological areas, such as Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in On-board Data Subsystems, and AI and Data Security in the Space System Software domain. Furthermore, the ‘Quantum Technologies’ have now been detailed in a dedicated technological group. In our paper, we examine the above-mentioned complexity of the cybersecurity field in the space sector, by reviewing both the scientific literature and the worldwide patents. We combined the ESA Technology Tree, with the state-of-the-art in cybersecurity taxonomies (e.g. JRC, ENISA, etc.) developed to facilitate the categorization of cybersecurity competencies. By using specific keywords, we analysed patent and scientific publication data for the period 2010 - 2020. We identified the global trends, the International Patent Classification (IPC), the geographic distribution, the top assignees and funding sponsors, etc. Patent and literature indicators, integrated with market information, provided a clear evaluation of the related technology trends and readiness levels of cybersecurity in the space domain. ,,, .

Ground Station as a Service: A Space Cybersecurity Analysis.Amidst increasing digitalization of space systems, cloud computing has expanded to the space domain by providing new data processing tools to satellite operators and end-users. Cloud computing is now going further by integrating ground station systems – Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS). Established cloud service providers such as Amazon and Microsoft are now delivering services allowing satellite operators to uplink and downlink data from their own satellites and spacecraft and process it within the cloud environment. However, this novel architecture brings cybersecurity risks and an increased attack surface, and threat actors will undoubtedly benefit from this significantly lowered cost of entry to the space environment. Also, while GSaaS brings high cost efficiency through externalization, mutualizing antenna resources comes with a compromise in independence, and opens novel attack vectors. This paper addresses the cybersecurity tradeoffs that Ground Station as a Service represents for the space industry, both from a technical aspect and also from legal and political perspectives. After presenting the GSaaS concept, characteristics, and market leaders, this paper outlines how GSaaS is representative of the new big data driven space economy. In addition, it assesses potential cyber risks affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability such as data breaches, advanced persistent threats, and supply chain compromise. Finally, it analyzes cyber risk management from the standpoint of data sovereignty, legal compliance, and cyber policies.

The cyber kill chain founded in the current cybersecurity framework is to be updated for the data transmission providing by the Esprit module. It concerns both the need of simulation for the lunar networks incoming and data from Earth ground to lunar surface via the Gateway. This cyber kill chain will be able to understand the way to improve the security and the safety of the crew and the spacecraft through an accurate management. And with the Apollo missions and the ISS experience, the cyber kill chain will introduce the cognitive cybersecurity as well the specific components of the space cybersecurity in the deep Space.
From complex to complicated: development of a Model Based Systems Engineering and cyber security approach for a quantum key distribution nanosatellite..Current global security systems are built on the premise that mathematical complexity and limitations of processing power are sufficient to protect data. With the emergence of quantum computing these assumptions are now being challenged. Space based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of encryption key delivery offering significant benefits over ground-based counterparts in terms of range and coverage. Additionally, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers increases in efficiency through cloud avoidance. For an AI enabled nanosatellite for QKD, design engineers must trade the often-conflicting requirements of space, cybersecurity, AI and quantum to progress the design from the complex to the merely complicated. The Responsive Operations for Key Services (ROKS) mission aims to provide QKD services which augment larger scale QKD efforts. The onboarding of AI to detect and avoid cloud has a significant impact on the concept of operations, moving to significant levels of autonomy. In systems engineering terms, added to the design burden of implementing an emerging technology such as QKD, the established principles of operation are also being challenged. Additionally, as nanosatellites have rarely been deployed as nodes in a secure network to date, the project requires the synthesising of different security standards and approaches into a coherent framework. For the programme significant consideration is given to project lifecycle. In the initial phases agile principles are employed, allowing for experimentation in design. With increasing knowledge of the problem space, there is a reduction in the uncertainty in design elements, leading to a transition from an agile based lifecycle to the waterfall-based methods more suitable for Flight Model implementation. Underpinning the project is a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. Enterprise Architect was selected as the MBSE tool of choice during blue sky design stages, allowing a smooth transition from capability level considerations to systems and subsystems design. The Zachman framework offers a consistent, but potentially over flexible, approach to model development. MBSE offers a clear methodology for integrating the model with external simulation tools to provide on ground verification of platform behaviours and porting design effort to support new mission concepts. The application of flexibility in lifecycle management, sound security principles and a model-based approach to technical development has proven to be a highly effective approach in increasing our understanding of complex systems allowing for complicated, but mature, designs to be defined.

Bird's-eye view on the Automotive Cybersecurity Landscape Challenges in adopting AI/ML.The integration of intelligent functionalities in con-nected and autonomous automotive system has great potential to deliver personalised user experience and improve traffic manage-ment. It can benefit the society by improving highway capacity and safety of road users. The adoption of data-driven Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models in the automotive sector is opening venues to new services and business models such as autonomous fleet management, self-driving trucks, robo-Taxi etc. However, where the sharing of mix-critical data brings opportunities, it simultaneously presents serious cybersecurity and functional safety risks.

Investigating operative cybersecurity awareness in air traffic control.Although the feasibility of cyberattacks manipulating air traffic control surveillance data have been demonstrated, the probability that such attacks can occur is seen as very low in the aviation industry. As a consequence, training to prepare for such events is typically not conducted. This paper presents a study using surveillance pictures and low-fidelity simulation to investigate the operative cybersecurity awareness of air traffic control officers (ATCOs). Five licensed ATCOs participated in a 1-1.5-hour remote data collection session. The results show that the participants did not detect the developing cyberattack until it became very obvious. The participant's perception of the situation was changed after they realized it was a cyber-event. Although they focused on traffic resolution and the safety of the aircrafts, they now prepared for situations where the aircraft had to land on their own due to possible further degradation of air traffic management systems. The study also showed the feasibility of using a low-fidelity simulation of ATM scenarios with remote participation. Even though interactivity and realism were limited, this kind of abstracted simulation allowed for learning from and reflecting around the scenarios. The results show the needs for awareness of possible cyber events in the operative environment. air traffic control. awareness. cybersecurity. preparedness. training 
Designing a modular and distributed web crawler focused on unstructured cybersecurity intelligence.There are many use cases for cybersecurity related information available on the Internet. Tasks relating to natural language processing and machine learning require large amounts of structured and labeled data. However, the availability of recent data is limited due to the difficulty in its sanitization, retrieval, and labeling. Data on the Internet is generally diverse and unstructured, and storing this information in a manner that is easily usable for research and development purposes is not an intuitive task. We propose architectural considerations when developing a distributed system consisting of web crawlers, web scrapers, and various post-processing components, as well as possible implementations of these considerations. Our team developed such a system that is capable of applying structure and storing open source intelligence data from the Internet in an easily-searchable software platform called Splunk.
VNWTS: A Virtual Water Chlorination Process for Cybersecurity Analysis of Industrial Control Systems.The rapid development of technology during the last decades has led to the integration of the network capabilities in the devices that are essential in the operation of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Consequently, the attack surface of these assets has increased, putting at risk the nations that depend heavily on them for their continuity and functions. ICS physical and virtual testbeds are ideal platforms that can be used for cybersecurity research. Compared to physical testbeds, virtual testbeds are less expensive, safer to maintain, and more accessible, especially when access to research labs is restricted due to unforeseen circumstances such as COVID 19. Therefore, in this article, we propose VNWTS, a virtual water chlorination process for ICS cybersecurity analysis. VNWTS is composed of virtual components commonly found in physical ICS implementations. In addition, we implemented a set of attacks targeting the memory of the S7-1500 PLC and other VNWTS components such as level sensors, temperature sensors, and pumps. The results obtained from the experimentation phase show that the structure, configuration, and implementation of the VNWTS testbed can be used in ICS cybersecurity research.

Big Data Cybersecurity Monitoring System using Machine Learning.The rapid growth of the Internet, and other technological advances in recent times have led to generation of data at an alarming rate. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is the process of analyzing the large amounts of data generated to uncover information to make business decisions. In addition, the wide variety of applications of this data has made it a very high value target, making cybersecurity increasingly important, while traditional methods fail to keep up with the large scale of data. Our aim is to build an architecture dedicated to medium scale enterprise networks which can be potentially resized to high scale networks and their security monitoring. This Big data monitoring system will use DNS data, NetFlow records, and HTTP traffic to train ML models to analyze and correlate the data, allowing us to detect any type of threat using well-known Big Data frameworks like Spark.

Trends in Cybersecurity Management Issues Related to Human Behaviour and Machine Learning.The number of organisational cybersecurity threats continues to increase every year as technology advances. All too often, organisations assume that implementing systems security measures like firewalls and anti-virus software will eradicate cyber threats. However, even the most robust security systems are vulnerable to threats. As advanced as machine learning cybersecurity technology is becoming, it cannot be solely relied upon to solve cyber threats. There are other forces that contribute to these threats that are many-a-times out of an organisation's control i.e., human behaviour. This research article aims to create an understanding of the trends in key cybersecurity management issues that have developed in the past five years in relation to human behaviour and machine learning. The methodology adopted to guide the synthesis of this review was a systematic literature review. The guidelines for conducting the review are presented in the review approach. The key cybersecurity management issues highlighted by the research includes risky security behaviours demonstrated by employees, social engineering, the current limitations present in machine learning insider threat detection, machine learning enhanced cyber threats, and the underinvestment challenges faced in the cybersecurity domain. behaviour. cyber threat. cybersecurity. machine learning. management. organisation. trends

Plan2Defend: AI Planning for Cybersecurity in Smart Grids.AI Planning (or Automated Planning) is a sub-field within AI which has been applied to several information security sub-fields, particularly vulnerability detection and incident response. Compared to other AI techniques such as machine learning, AI planning has the advantage of requiring no data or datasets to train. Instead, an entity within a domain is modelled, describing the relevant features of an environment, the goals, constraints, and the actions available to the entity. This paper surveys the traditional field of automated planning and explores its application to the field of information security and in particular, automating cyber incident response. Relevant AI planning techniques are then applied to implement a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of automating incident response, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) against smart grid as a use case. The effectiveness of this prototype is validated on a digital twin power delivery system at The University of Queensland Industry 4.0 Energy Testlab. The effectiveness of this prototype is quantitatively assessed with reference to best industry practice before discussing the strengths and weaknesses of adopting AI planning for incident response, and information security domains generally.

Cyber Security Threats and Their Solutions Through Deep Learning: A Bibliometric Analysis.Nowadays a major concern in the field of information technology is Cyber security. Although in the recent times there have been booming advancements in the field of technology, but it has also brought along various risks including malware attacks, cloud abuse hacking, insecure API, cyber scams, data breach and so on. Because cyber-attacks are convenient, cheap and involves less risks, these are the reasons that they go on multiplying [32]. A cybercriminal only needs a few expenses in addition to a computer and an active internet connection. There are no other constraints such as geography and distance[1]. Therefore, to tackle the increasing menace of cybercrimes, researchers have started their work on cyber security making it the most promising field of study. Therefore, in today's world of business, cybersecurity has become an urgent need. Understanding this need, deep learning methods are being used by cybersecurity experts for dealing with various problems foisted by the cyber criminals[2]. This paper reviews various threats in the path of cyber security and it also brings to light various deep learning methods that have been employed to combat with these threats.

Uncertainty Quantification for Trusted Machine Learning in Space System Cyber Security.In recent years, the Aerospace Corporation has been developing machine learning systems to detect cyber anomalies in space system command and telemetry streams. However, to enable the use of deep learning in such high consequence environments, the models must be trustworthy. One aspect of trust is a model's ability to accurately quantify the uncertainty of its predictions. Although many deep learning models output what seem to be confidence scores, current academic research has repeatedly shown that models often return high confidence even when very wrong and are unable to diagnose and respond appropriately to out-of-distribution inputs. This can result in catastrophic overconfidence when models are faced with adversarial inputs or concept drift. Even on routine inputs, without reliable uncertainty quantification, it is hard for human-machine teaming to take place as humans cannot trust the model's reported confidence score. In short, all models are wrong sometimes, but models which know when they are wrong are considerably more useful. To this end, The Aerospace Corporation conducted a literature review and implemented current state of the art methods, including deep ensembles and temperature scaling for confidence calibration, to accurately quantify the uncertainty of deep learning model predictions. We further incorporated and tested these techniques within the existing cyber defense model framework for more trustworthy cyber anomaly detection models. We show that not only are these techniques successful, they are also easy to implement, extensible to many applications and machine learning model variants, and provide interpretable results for a wide audience. From this, Aerospace recommends further adoption of such techniques in high consequence environments. command. confidence calibration. deep learning. machine learning. space. telemetry. trusted artificial intelligence. uncertainty quantification

Cybersecurity Risks in Meat Processing Plant and Impacts on Total Productive Maintenance.Technological changes have been happening in production facilities including food manufacturing industries in an ever-increasing rate. This includes advancement in data capture devices, signal processing, communication capabilities and automated process control systems such as Internet of Things. It is more challenging where production systems are highly reliant on automation and robotics. Remote performance monitoring and controls are becoming progressively vulnerable due to risks associated with cyber security and corporate espionage. May 2021 cyber-Attack forced JBS meats USA to pay 11m in ransom money to stop any further disruptions in services. This heavily impacted JBS global operations including JBS Australian food manufacturing facilities. Food production facilities in Australia have critical control points supported by smart technologies as part of their food safety management systems. Cyber-Attacks on production facilities could result in financial, operational, health and safety consequences. As survey by the Australian Cyber Security Centre in 2020 revealed that Australian small businesses are impacted by cybercime each year with a loss of 300m. To present the potential cyber security threats and their associated risk level, a case study is presented based on the processing and manufacture of meat products in Australia. From this case study, to protect the meat industries from attacks, we identify cyber security attacks and their possible mitigation strategies. This research shows cyber security attacks can severely affect Overall Equipment Effectiveness which motivate us to embed cyber security as an additional pillar in existing 8 pillars Total Productive Maintenance. If cyber security is added as additional pillar, it will improve the quality of end products and overall productivity of manufacturing industries. Critical control points. cyber security.

Digital Twins and Cyber Security - solution or challenge?.Digital twin technology today is diverse and emerging and its full potential is not yet widely understood. The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration. In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence.

Towards the use of Participatory Methods in Cybersecurity research in rural Africa: A grassroots Approach.As a research domain, Cybersecurity has been around for a long time. However, research methods and outputs have been deeply rooted in western epistemologies, thus leaving pockets of communities in rural Africa at possible risk. Even though some research on the African continent aims to address cybersecurity awareness, they still utilize a top-down approach, with interventions designed and developed for rural end users often without their input. This position paper proposes a new research focus in cybersecurity research within rural communities in Africa and for cybersecurity research in rural African communities. Participatory methods have been utilized in human-computer interactions research with greater impact of end-product adoptability, sense of ownership of communities involved and overall design implications for design research as a whole. We therefore argue that for cybersecurity research to have sustainable effects for these communities on the fringes of society, a participatory design approach needs to be considered in cybersecurity research.

Towards modeling of naval systems interdependencies for cybersecurity.To ensure a ship's fully operational status in a wide spectrum of missions, as passenger transportation, international trade, and military activities, numerous interdependent systems are essential. Despite the potential critical consequences of misunderstanding or ignoring those interdependencies, there are very few documented approaches to enable their identification, representation, analysis, and use. From the cybersecurity point of view, if an anomaly occurs on one of the interdependent systems, it could eventually impact the whole ship, jeopardizing its mission success. This paper presents a proposal to identify the main dependencies of layers within and between generic ship's functional blocks. An analysis of one of these layers, the platform systems, is developed to examine a naval cyber-physical system (CPS), the water management for passenger use, and its associated dependencies, from an intrinsic perspective. This analysis generates a three layers graph, on which dependencies are represented as oriented edges. Each abstraction level of the graph represents the physical, digital, and system variables of the examined CPS. The obtained result confirms the interest of graphs for dependencies representation and analysis. It is an operational depiction of the different systems interdependencies, on which can rely a cybersecurity evaluation, like anomaly detection and propagation assessment. Cybersecurity.

Effective Learning of Cybersecurity Concepts with Model-Eliciting Activities.As security is a crucial aspect in the process of developing software systems, software engineers must have a strong understanding of security concepts for an application being developed and tested. There has been a growing demand for these skills to be taught on all knowledge levels in computing courses. This paper builds on a study related to a series of security modules designed to meet that demand for teaching security concepts to students in computer science courses. Six small lessons in three security modules are implemented into a CS2 course, and the outcomes of this implementation are assessed. Each concept in the modules is broken up into a general description of the security problem, sample code written in Java, and sample code of the solution. Along with the security modules, an open-ended, problem-solving Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) was developed as a project for students to demonstrate an understanding of the security concepts. Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the teaching effectiveness of implementing cyber security modules with the MEA project and students' experiences in conceptual modeling tasks in problem solving. After implementing the security modules with the MEA, students showed a good understanding of cyber security concepts, and the instructor's beliefs about teaching shifted from teacher-centered to student-centered. 41.7% of the developed solutions from the MEA groups showed a sufficient degree of creativity, and 58.3% of the solutions seemed suitable for real-world implementation. The initial activities leading to student developed solutions effectively prepared students within the scope of the course, but additional discussion and resources may be necessary to expand on creativity and practicality. cipher. computer science education.

Sharing is Caring: Optimized Threat Visualization for a Cybersecurity Data Sharing Platform.Cyberattacks are increasingly costing organizations billions of dollars annually. To protect against them, cybersecurity information sharing and cyberthreat visualization have become crucial research topics. Our platform, CYBersecurity information EXchange with Privacy (CYBEX-P), implements developments in both areas as an approachable collaborative security tool. CYBEX-P's threat-intelligence graph displays indicators of compromise and their crowd-reported threat levels. Intuitive and efficient data interaction is key for adoption of such a contributor-driven system and is the focus of this work. A user study was conducted with participants from cybersecurity backgrounds to test different visualization configurations. Measurements pertaining to dependent variables such as task accuracy and threat-detection time were recorded. Subsequent analysis revealed that relying on localized color to represent threat comes with serious limitations. Likewise, information density must be carefully considered. We conclude that the misuse of simple visual properties can lead to perilous reductions in accuracy and response-time and provide recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls. cybersecurity information sharing. cyberthreat investigation.

Explainability of Cybersecurity Threats Data Using SHAP.Nowadays, cybersecurity threats have become a worrisome issue that need to be addressed in all of the world. Almost all people have smart devices that are connected worldwide and many are using social media platforms, and thus, most of their personal information is used and shared. An example of cybersecurity threats are malicious URLs and malware, which are very likely to impact general users. For the research community, detecting new types of attacks is a challenge. Most of the past research studies focused on surveying malicious attack detection. The classification models detect the kind of attacks by using machine learning approaches. Interpreting machine learning models is also an important issue. Tree, Deep, and Kernel of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) are well-known techniques, which achieve efficient performance in interpreting the results. In this paper, two cyber data sets are investigated, both being five-class data sets, for which the Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classification, and the Keras Sequential algorithms are applied. The obtained results confirm that applying the classifiers to generate the models are good choices to detect cybersecurity threats. The efficacy of these models' performance was evaluated by measuring the precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix. In addition, three SHAP methods are used to explain the output of the resulting machine learning models for the five-class data sets. DeepShap. Explain. KernelShap. RFC. Sequential. SHAP. TreeShap.

Digital forensics, video forgery recognition, for cybersecurity systems.The major advances in mobile video recording systems have led to an increased number of videos being streamed and uploaded on the internet daily. This has had a major impact on the expansion rate of the IoT with the addition of affordable security systems that capture and stream video content. These systems regularly meet minimal security standards resulting to breaches and data theft. The scientific branch of Computer Forensics has proposed various methods for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of videos, but the need for more robust and effective methods rises as videos grow, in size and number, while compression algorithms are becoming increasingly more efficient. The goal of this paper is to propose a new method on forgery detection, based on the characteristics of Dense Optical Flow. This method is applied on a low-cost device able to capture static CCTV video. The framework is tested for proof of its effectiveness in detecting copy-move, insertion and deletion forgeries. Ultimately, an identification automation method if proposed along with future improvements. Cybersecurity. Digital forensics. Hardware security. Internet of things (IoT). Multimedia tampering.

UltraLearn: Next-Generation CyberSecurity Learning Platform.Learning was always an essential part of our lives to acquire knowledge and move forward. However, the increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore, finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic learning approach using two different groups. Attack. Cybersecurity. Gamification. Online Learning. Training 
Oppositional Human Factors in Cybersecurity: A Preliminary Analysis of Affective States.The need for cyber defense research is growing as more cyber-attacks are directed at critical infrastructure and other sensitive networks. Traditionally, the focus has been on hardening system defenses. However, other techniques are being explored including cyber and psychological deception which aim to negatively impact the cognitive and emotional state of cyber attackers directly through the manipulation of network characteristics. In this study, we present a preliminary analysis of survey data collected following a controlled experiment in which over 130 professional red teamers participated in a network penetration task that included cyber deception and psychological deception manipulations [7]. Thematic and inductive analysis of previously un-analyzed open-ended survey responses revealed factors associated with affective states. These preliminary results are a first step in our analysis efforts and show that there are potentially several distinct dimensions of cyber-behavior that induce negative affective states in cyber attackers, which may serve as potential avenues for supplementing traditional cyber defense strategies.

ACSIMA: A Cyber Security Index for Mobile Health Apps.Mobile health (mHealth) apps can make healthcare more accessible and affordable by enabling users to perform a range of self-service activities to manage their own health and wellbeing. However, the mHealth app market is largely unregulated, potentially exposing app users to substantial cyber security risks. In this exploratory study, we present the Australian Cyber Security Index for mHealth Apps (ACSIMA) as a curated cyber security checklist that can guide the assessment of existing mHealth apps as well as the design/development of new apps. In contrast to existing mHealth app assessment frameworks, ACSIMA (1) focuses exclusively on cyber security, (2) takes a multi-stakeholder approach to cyber security assessment, and (3) is specific to the Australian digital health context. ACSIMA is aimed at raising the level of cyber security acuity among different stakeholder groups, including app users and app developers, and can be considered a first step towards the provision of reliable and trustworthy digital health services. We validate ACSIMA's usability and practicability through an online survey with the different stakeholder groups. The study finds that different stakeholder groups exhibit different levels of familiarity and importance towards the ACSIMA checklist, validating the need for raising the awareness of cyber security concerns in mHealth apps across all stakeholder groups. checklist. mHealth apps. privacy. security 
Distributed Optimal Heating Control of a Residential Building Resilient to Cybersecurity Issues.Predictive control and optimization in buildings proved to be a promising approach in increasing energy efficiency of the sector as one of the largest energy consumer. Zone digitalization is still one of the ongoing issues in older buildings, and has only recently started to be interesting in the residential sector due to high prices of required expert knowledge and automation equipment. However, buildings systems digitalization and networking also brought to fore the system security issues. Distributed approach to zone digitalization and predictive control, enabled by recent advances in embedded technology, implies both hardware topology and control algorithm structure. The paper focuses on a case where each zone holds a separate controller with tailored temperature setpoint prediction and model predictive control algorithm, which independently calculate the optimal heating control laws of the corresponding zones. Furthermore, the controllers are mutually and iteratively bidding toward the joint energy efficiency goal of the whole building. Such control structure enables fast digitalization and optimal joint operation of the building while keeping the independency of the users and retaining the data privacy. Only essential data is transmitted to the central coordinator in form of a summed information, which cannot extrapolate particular user data. Additionally, single zone controller security breach does not inflict damage to the whole system. System resiliency to security issues is therefore strongly increased. Data privacy protection.

CyBERT: Contextualized Embeddings for the Cybersecurity Domain.We present CyBERT, a domain-specific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, fine-tuned with a large corpus of textual cybersecurity data. State-of-the-art natural language models that can process dense, fine-grained textual threat, attack, and vulnerability information can provide numerous benefits to the cybersecurity community. The primary contribution of this paper is providing the security community with an initial fine-tuned BERT model that can perform a variety of cybersecurity-specific downstream tasks with high accuracy and efficient use of resources. We create a cybersecurity corpus from open-source unstructured and semi-unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data and use it to fine-tune a base BERT model with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to recognize specialized cybersecurity entities. We evaluate the model using various downstream tasks that can benefit modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs). The fine-tuned CyBERT model outperforms the base BERT model in the domain-specific MLM evaluation. We also provide use-cases of CyBERT application in cybersecurity based downstream tasks.

Cybersecurity Taxonomy: Research and knowledge areas.In this paper, we proposed a taxonomy to relate areas of knowledge with cybersecurity research. The structure of the taxonomy integrates various areas of knowledge applied in research, congresses, certifications, tools and work roles defined in the ACM curriculum. Through the proposed taxonomy, students in science and engineering can find lines of research and knowledge generated in the field of cybersecurity. In this way, the generation of academic projects and research related to cybersecurity is promoted. The proposal aims to reduce the gap in the search for bibliographic sources by allowing the addition in academic curricula in engineering and science careers. This contributes to the development of new work roles and research methodologies generating knowledge through the cases of cyber-attack suffered by organizations. The basis of the proposed taxonomy is based on the integration of the ACM curriculum with the NICE framework and the topics most relevant to the understanding of cybersecurity. The proposal was validated based on the judgment of experts in higher education resulting in a 54% improvement in the level of knowledge in cybersecurity lines generated by the proposed taxonomy.

Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph Improvement with Graph Neural Networks.Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) help in aggregating information about cyber-events. CKGs combined with reasoning and querying systems such as SPARQL enable security researchers to look up information about past cyberevents that is helpful in understanding future cyber-events or drawing similarity with a known cyber-event recorded in a CKG. CKGs have assertions in the form of semantic triples. The triples describe a relationship between a subject and object, both of which are cybersecurity entities. The quality of information present in the CKG depends on the data source. Since data sources can have varying degrees of reliability, we need a score that should help us benchmark the veracity of the CKG assertions. Verifying the information asserted in the CKG is a challenging task. In this paper, we describe a novel method that associates a score with the semantic triples asserted in the CKG using deep learning. We use semantic triples that we know are correct, in a supervised machine learning algorithm that produces the output for each relationship. In particular, we use Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) on a dataset of CKGs that can be used to ascertain the scores for each semantic triple. Artificial Intelligence. Cybersecurity.

Combating Fake Cyber Threat Intelligence using Provenance in Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs.Today there is a significant amount of fake cybersecurity related intelligence on the internet. To filter out such information, we build a system to capture the provenance information and represent it along with the captured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). In the cybersecurity domain, such CTI is stored in Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKG). We enhance the exiting CKG model to incorporate intelligence provenance and fuse provenance graphs with CKG. This process includes modifying traditional approaches to entity and relation extraction. CTI data is considered vital in securing our cyberspace. Knowledge graphs containing CTI information along with its provenance can provide expertise to dependent Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and human analysts. Cyber Threat Intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence Based Cybersecurity: Two-Step Suitability Test.Enormous network connectivity, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), digitalization of the world, and the use of social websites and apps have brought enormous institutional and individual security challenges. The conventional security system often fails to provide cyber security to institutions and individuals. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is highly adaptive and smart to handle the volatile cyber security environment. AI plays a prudent role in access control, user authentication and behavior analysis, spam, malware, and botnet detection. Machine learning (ML) models are the building blocks of AI. In this research, a novel practical approach is followed to prove the effectiveness of AI in the field of cyber-security. Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied to prove that. A two-step suitability test is conducted in this study. In the 1st step, the KDD'99 data set is used to train and test the AI models. In the second step, train models are repeatedly tested on a fresh data set, NSL-KDD. Finally, the testing results are compared to prove the authenticity of AI in cyber-security. An absolute practical approach and reliable outputs of various AI models prove AI's suitability in cyber-security. Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cyber Security. KDD'99. Machine Learning (ML).

Cybersecurity Threats in Connected and Automated Vehicles based Federated Learning Systems.Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that aims at training an algorithm across decentralized entities holding their local data private. Wireless mobile networks allow users to communicate with other fixed or mobile users. The road traffic network represents an infrastructure-based configuration of a wireless mobile network where the Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) represent the communicating entities. Applying FL in a wireless mobile network setting gives rise to a new threat in the mobile environment that is very different from the traditional fixed networks. The threat is due to the intrinsic characteristics of the wireless medium and is caused by the characteristics of the vehicular networks such as high node-mobility and rapidly changing topology. Most cyber defense techniques depend on highly reliable and connected networks. This paper explores falsified information attacks, which target the FL process that is ongoing at the RSU. We identified a number of attack strategies conducted by the malicious CAVs to disrupt the training of the global model in vehicular networks. We show that the attacks were able to increase the convergence time and decrease the accuracy of the model. We demonstrate that our attacks bypass FL defense strategies in their primary form and highlight the need for novel poisoning resilience defense mechanisms in the wireless mobile setting of the future road networks.

Conducting Malicious Cybersecurity Experiments on Crowdsourcing Platforms.Evaluating the effectiveness of defense technologies mandates the inclusion of a human element, specifically if these technologies target human cognition and emotions. One of the biggest challenges that face researchers in the realm of behavioral cybersecurity is participant recruitment. Researchers often rely on college students, the general public, real-world hackers, or a hard-to-reach population (e.g., professional red teamers) to test the effectiveness of cybersecurity defense techniques. However, recruiting participants from these populations has drawbacks, including but not limited to: high cost, time constraints, and manageability and accessibility issues. This research explored the applicability of using two popular crowdsourcing platforms, Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific, to conduct web hacking experiments. Our study is the first to use crowdsourcing platforms to run hacking experiments for scientific purposes. While the recruitment is challenging, the paradigm of existing crowdsourcing platforms can be useful for understanding adversarial behavior, as it facilitates access to a diverse set of participants and allows researchers to conduct longitudinal and cross-cultural assessments. In particular, crowdsourcing platforms offer a great opportunity for cybersecurity researchers to investigate the Oppositional Human Factors (OHFs) in a manageable and flexible way. Crowdsourcing.

Determining Bring Your Own Device (Byod) Security Policy Compliance among Malaysian Teleworkers: Perceived Cybersecurity Governance as Moderator.Literature evidently shows that many organizations have enabled Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) for their employees as an immediate strategy to cushion the risks of disruption to their business operations. Though these types of environments were typically not designed to support an organization's entire workforce, it certainly made the transition easier as BYOD policy offers organizational flexibility, efficiency, and collaboration in remote work-from-home cases. Although BYOD brings many benefits to organizations and employees, cybersecurity on one endpoint is a critical concern for organizations. Cyber intruders will capitalize on any cybersecurity vulnerabilities to steal valuable data. While organizations have established BYOD security policy as a basis, the issue is whether the teleworkers comply with it. Protection Motivation Theory is used to explain the action taken by teleworkers to protect themselves when under attack and how accounting teleworker's behavior to avoid cyber threat. Intention compliance has been studied by many researchers and recently, there was a call from a researcher to study the actual compliance in ISSPs due to a gap between intention and actual compliance. Hence, ensuring BYOD security policy compliance is crucial among the teleworkers. This paper, supported by Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) in addressing gaps in the literature, presents a conceptual model that examines determinants of BYOD security policy compliance among Malaysian teleworkers. The role of the perceived cybersecurity governance is also incorporated to investigate its interplay with the determinants. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). Cybersecurity Governance.

Cybersecurity Practices at the Initial Stages of the Software Engineering Process.Software Engineering is a foundation of modern computer systems development. The process involves several steps, including Analysis and Design, which are the fundamentals for building software systems. This discipline is offered by several university degrees these days around the world, included among other computer science courses.Nowadays, cybersecurity problems are very related with software weakness or bad designs, as an example one can mention bad implementations, projects with poor quality, lack of testing, among others issues. Overall one bigger problem is the lack of security integration from the inception and designing of the software project.Cybersecurity had gained a lot of attention in recent years. From the everyday desktop software been abused and exploited, such as browser exploits and Windows RDP protocol exploits, to abusing the Internet of Things to create massive botnets capable to disrupt the Internet service, as such as the Mirai attack in 2017.We believe that if security played a basic role from the inception of the software project, a lot of these incidents could be prevented. We previously proposed to introduce cybersecurity basics in the software engineering courses to raise awareness of these problems to future professional software engineers. In this paper, we focus on the first steps of software engineering and how cybersecurity should be embedded as good practices for every student in any given software project. Cybersecurity.

Investigating Cyber Security Factors Influencing the Perception Behavioral Intention of Small and Medium Enterprise.Technological developments have touched various fields of human life, including the economic field. Especially in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, which has a big impact on micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) who have to look for innovations to stay in their business in the midst of a pandemic. Changes in behavior and habits that were initially far from technology, and the arrival of a pandemic that limited many things, especially in communicating between humans, made technology one of the best solutions. But in the use of technology, there is a danger that targets MSMEs, especially those who are new to using technological devices, namely cyber security. The main question is how SMEs perceive cyber security. This study aims to determine the perception of MSMEs on cyber security by using the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) model. Data is collected through surveys. By using a quantitative approach, the data were analyzed using the Smart-PLS software. There are several variables raised in the study which are suspected of having an influence on Protective Behavioral Intention. Based on the results of the study indicate that the variables Perceived Severity (PS) and Self-Efficacy (SE) have a significant and positive effect on Protective Behavioral Intention (PBI). This study also shows that the use of information technology by MSMEs has begun to spread, but there is still no cyber security awareness found, so there is still no planning or mitigation of threats or risks (risk management). component. formatting. insert. style. styling

Network Data Curation Toolkit: Cybersecurity Data Collection, Aided-Labeling, and Rule Generation. Cybersecurity network data curation is the collection, labeling, and packaging of datasets that contain artifacts that are important in the cybersecurity domain. These assets are essential for cybersecurity research and key for defense technologies and systems to detect and respond to anomalies caused by adversaries. However, tools for data curation are lacking in all domains of cybersecurity, including enterprise and the military. Curation fuels empirical research and validation of protection, detection, and prevention techniques. Closing the gap will require the development of research-driven tools and technologies that facilitate and enforce not only collection and labeling, but also standardization and distribution. This paper describes a novel tool, called the Network Data Curation Toolkit (NDCT), which simplifies the process of collecting network traffic, keystrokes, mouse clicks. allows network packet labeling. automatically generates intrusion detection rules. and provides a visualization of results. Moreover, the tool has a built-in mechanism for exporting all data into a single distributable file. The tool is modular to allow extension and to facilitate its incorporation into existing workflows. We demonstrate the use of NDCT in two case studies. We first show how NDCT can augment cybersecurity exercises by having participants label their network data. We then describe a separate system that was embedded with the NDCT, which provides a workspace, allowing users to curate data through a multi-session environment, including generating intrusion detection rules for malware.

Integrating Cybersecurity into a Big Data Ecosystem.This paper provides an overview of the security service controls that are applied in a big data processing (BDP) system to defend against cyber security attacks. We validate this approach by modeling attacks and effectiveness of security service controls in a sequence of states and transitions. This Finite State Machine (FSM) approach uses the probable effectiveness of security service controls, as defined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). The attacks used in the model are defined in the ATTCK™ framework. Five different BDP security architecture configurations are considered, spanning from a low-cost default BDP configuration to a more expensive, industry supported layered security architecture. The analysis demonstrates the importance of a multi-layer approach to implementing security in BDP systems. With increasing interest in using BDP systems to analyze sensitive data sets, it is important to understand and justify BDP security architecture configurations with their significant costs. The output of the model demonstrates that over the run time, larger investment in security service controls results in significantly more uptime. There is a significant increase in uptime with a linear increase in security service control investment. We believe that these results support our recommended BDP security architecture. That is, a layered architecture with security service controls integrated into the user interface, boundary, central management of security policies, and applications that incorporate privacy preserving programs. These results enable making BDP systems operational for sensitive data accessed in a multi-tenant environment. Big data. Cybersecurity. Hadoop 
Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Based on Cognitive Attack Vector Modeling with CVSS Score.The modeling of scenarios of complex multistep targeted cyber attacks is considered. To determine all scenarios for the implementation of an attack, the FSTEC of Russia Methodology for assessing threats to information security and CAPEC attack patterns are used. Attack vector is presented in the form of an attack graph with further formalization in the form of a hierarchical fuzzy cognitive map for the possibility of multiple scale analysis. Automated modeling of a set of possible attacks allows extract information about infrastructure weaknesses, the most dangerous vulnerabilities and potential weaknesses of system components, identify the most successful attack scenarios and assess their consequences for the enterprise. The calculation of the quantitative assessment of the local relative risk is conducted based on the vulnerability severity levels, considering the CVSS environmental metrics for the industrial control system for the transport of commercial oil.

However, the rapid growth in penetration of such technologies carries a number of risks. These risks are related to the security of personal data. This paper examines trends in the use of artificial intelligence in everyday life of people. The authors made an attempt to make a connection between cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Also, the issues of cyberattacks using artificial intelligence and attacks on artificial intelligence are considered. artificial intelligence. cybersecurity. information security 
Using CGAN to Deal with Class Imbalance and Small Sample Size in Cybersecurity Problems.Predictive modelling in cybersecurity domains usually involves dealing with complex settings. The class imbalance problem is a well-know challenge typically present in the cybersecurity domain. For instance, in a real-world intrusion detection scenario, the number of attacks is expected to be a a very small percentage of the normal cases. Moreover, in these applications, the number of available examples labelled is also small due to the complexity and cost of the labelling process: teams of domain experts need to be involved in the process which becomes expensive, time consuming and prone to errors. To address these problems is critical to the success of predictive modelling in cybersecurity applications. In this paper we tackle the class imbalance and small sample size through the use of a CGAN-based up-sampling procedure. We carry out an extensive set of experiments that show the positive impact of applying this solution to address the class imbalance and small sample size problems. A large data repository is built and freely provided to the research community containing 114 binary datasets based on real-world cybersecurity problems that are generated with diversified levels of imbalance and sample size. Our experiments show a clear advantage of using the CGAN-based up-sampling method specially for situations where the sample size is small and there is a large imbalance between the problem classes. In the most critical scenarios associated with extreme rarity and very small sample size, an impressive performance boost is achieved. We also explore the behaviour of this approach when the presence of these problems is less marked and we found that, while CGAN-based up-sampling is not able to further improve the minority class performance, it also has no negative impact. Thus, it is a safe to use solution, also in these scenarios. Class Imbalance. Cybersecurity Datasets. Generative Adversarial Networks. Small Sample Size. Up-sampling 
Extending the Command and Control System to Simulation System Interoperation (C2SIM) Standard to Address Exchange of Cybersecurity Information. The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) approved the Command and Control Systems - Simulation Systems Interoperation (C2SIM) international standard in April 2020. C2SIM standardizes information interchange across command and control (C2) systems, simulation systems, and robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) for scenario initialization, orders, and reports. The C2SIM standard replaces the Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL. SISO-STD-007-2008) and Coalition Battle Management Language (C-BML. SISO-STD-011-2014) SISO standards. The C2SIM standard specifies a core logical data model using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In parallel, the SISO Cyber Modeling and Simulation Product Development Group is developing a Cyber Data Exchange Model (Cyber DEM) standard for exchange of cybersecurity information (devices, networks, events) across simulations. C2SIM provides an opportunity to employ the emerging Cyber DEM standard to exchange such information across a broad set of systems, to include C2 systems, simulation systems, and RAS. This paper describes a technical approach to integrating Cyber DEM with C2SIM, with examples of potential use of the data interchange in federations of systems. C2SIM. CyberDEM. Cybersecurity.

Does Learning Method Matter in Cyber Security Behaviour? Spaced Vs. Massed e-Learning.Besides acquiring knowledge and skills, learning can also have a behavior change purpose. The case of learning compliance and cyber hygiene is an example. It remains a largely unexplored question whether learning methods affect the degree of intention to follow the learned behavior. Spaced learning has been established as a useful presentation style for the retention of information and building skills, but many organisations continue to use a massed e-learning format. This study compares three presentation formats (spaced, massed, and mixed) using a newly developed e-learning tool for the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Mixed methods are used to examine differences as well as to explore user perceptions and preferences. Forty-seven participants completed baseline tests and were randomly allocated to one of the three presentation style conditions. All participants completed immediate post-tests, delayed post-tests, and behavioral intention questionnaires. Despite some large observed differences between individuals, the univariate analyses showed that the gain scores between immediate post-test and delayed post-tests were not significantly different between participants across the three presentation formats. The qualitative analysis revealed emerging themes of presentation, delivery, messenger effects, and motivations. Cyber security behavior. Cyber security education. Learning methods 
Casting a Wide Net: An Internet of Things Testbed for Cybersecurity Education and Research.The last few years have seen an explosive growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) as billions of new low-powered devices are connected to the network in every sector, from household items to sensors, healthcare devices, and industrial controls. Devices often rely on vertical architectures, with each type of device requiring a separate platform for control, data sharing, and storage. New horizontal architectures are needed to allow sharing of resources between devices to optimize hardware efficiency. In addition, new networking paradigms such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) are required to efficiently manage increased delay-sensitive network demand. This broad range of new technologies and skills make entry difficult for students and new researchers, and innovative practical testbeds for IoT systems and SDN will be required for training and research. We propose an IoT testbed with multiple networking layers and heterogeneous devices to simultaneously support networking research, anomaly detection, and security principles applied specifically to IoT for education and research, providing a complex yet practical hands-on environment made entirely of open-source tools and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) materials that can be replicated for use by others seeking to build such a system.

Research on Cybersecurity Testing for In-vehicle Network.The development of technologies such as Information Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), and industrial intelligence has made automotive cybersecurity issues more prominent. Cybersecurity issues have gradually attracted widespread attention in the field of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICV). Cybersecurity testing is an effective means to ensure the cybersecurity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Fuzzing and penetration testing are both important methods of security testing. In SAE J3061 and the impending ISO/SAE 21434, it is clearly mentioned that fuzzing and penetration testing technologies should be applied in the development of automotive cybersecurity activities, but no specific testing details are involved. The WP.29 regulations also require security tests to verify the effectiveness of security measures when conducting type approval with regard to cybersecurity. There is neither a standardized method for how to conduct automotive cybersecurity testing, nor specific testing tools. In this paper, a brief overview of the applied security testing methods in the automotive domain is provided first. Then, we present a cybersecurity testing method, which extends the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) from the perspective of testing processes. Besides, we also design and develop a security testing tool for the in-vehicle network to assist security analysis. Finally, taking Controller Area Network with Flexible Data Rate (CAN FD) as an example, the proposed method is applied to the designed testbed. automotive cybersecurity testing. fuzzing testing. in-vehicle network. penetration testing 
A Survey on Credit Card Fraud Detection Techniques in Banking Industry for Cyber Security.The technological revolution is accelerating due to a number of key enabling technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML), big data, blockchain, cloud computing, Internet of Thing (IoT).

Credit card fraud is one of the most serious threats facing the banking industry worldwide. Credit card fraud is expanding at an alarming rate and has developed into a significant problem, particularly as the volume of financial transactions involving credit cards continues to expand. In this paper, we have reviewed various credit card fraud detection techniques that can strengthen the defense against a range of frauds. Additionally, we analysed the findings and reported the research challenges. Finally, we compared various techniques and highlighted their advantages and disadvantages. This will help provide guidance for determining the most appropriate techniques for credit card fraud detection. Artificial intelligence. Banking. Credit card. Credit card fraud detection. Fraud.

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Distribution Power System Cybersecurity Protection.The sophistication and regularity of power system cybersecurity attacks has been growing in the last decade, leading researchers to investigate new innovative, cyber-resilient tools to help grid operators defend their networks and power systems. One promising approach is to apply recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to aid grid operators in making real-time changes to the power system equipment to counteract malicious actions. While multiple transmission studies have been conducted in the past, in this work we investigate the possibility of defending distribution power systems using a DRL agent who has control of a collection of utility-owned distributed energy resources (DER). A game board using a modified version of the IEEE 13-bus model was simulated using OpenDSS to train the DRL agent and compare its performance to a random agent, a greedy agent, and human players. Both the DRL agent and the greedy approach performed well, suggesting a greedy approach can be appropriate for computationally tractable system configurations and a DRL agent is a viable path forward for systems of increased complexity. This work paves the way to create multi-player distribution system control games which could be designed to defend the power grid under a sophisticated cyber-attack. deep reinforcement learning. distribution power systems. machine learning. resilient energy systems 
A Testbed for Advanced Distribution Management Systems: Assessment of Cybersecurity.This paper presents the initial implementation of cyberphysical testbed for Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS). The testbed is used for cybersecurity assessment of smart power distribution network operation use case of TSO-DSO coordinated reactive power management. The test in our National Smart grid Laboratory (NSGL) demonstrates the impact of a cyber security attack on the operation of the physical power distribution network where intruders alter the voltage reference signals communicated from the control room to the On-load tap changer (OLTC) in the field. This paper highlights the use of laboratory ADMS testbeds for scientifically assessing operational benefits and cyber security vulnerabilities.

Constructing Flow Graphs from Procedural Cybersecurity Texts.Following procedural texts written in natural languages is challenging. We must read the whole text to identify the relevant information or identify the instruction-flow to complete a task, which is prone to failures. If such texts are structured, we can readily visualize instruction-flows, reason or infer a particular step, or even build automated systems to help novice agents achieve a goal. However, this structure recovery task is a challenge because of such texts' diverse nature. This paper proposes to identify relevant information from such texts and generate information flows between sentences. We built a large annotated procedural text dataset (CTFW) in the cybersecurity domain (3154 documents). This dataset contains valuable instructions regarding software vulnerability analysis experiences. We performed extensive experiments on CTFW with our LM-GNN model variants in multiple settings. To show the generalizability of both this task and our method, we also experimented with procedural texts from two other domains (Maintenance Manual and Cooking), which are substantially different from cybersecurity. Our experiments show that Graph Convolution Network with BERT sentence embeddings outperforms BERT in all three domains.
ABET Cybersecurity Continual Course Improvements for Secure Software Development.This is an innovative practice full paper. The need to develop software securely cannot be over-emphasized. The changing legal and regulatory international and local landscape for software requirements is astounding. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Chinese Cybersecurity laws, and the credit card industry's Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) are all upholding higher standards for system development and deployment. Such legal and regulatory changes of necessity require modifications and updating in software development methods that must be incorporated into cybersecurity software development courses to properly prepare students for successfully working in the field. To address these and other changes within the computing field, the Accreditation Board for Engineering (ABET) recently proposed preliminary cybersecurity accreditation criteria for which fewer than 20 universities have both applied and become ABET Cybersecurity accredited. The accreditation requires maintaining continuous course improvement in the core courses including a secure software development course. This research first reports on important topics incorporated into a senior-level secure software development for cybersecurity majors. Our research then analyses student Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved surveys to learn which course components could benefit from continuous course improvements. We apply machine learning to help build categories for ABET continual improvement. Finally, we share lessons learned and plans for future work. application development. cybersecurity.

Reinforcing Cybersecurity Hands-on Training with Adaptive Learning.This Research To Practice Full Paper presents how learning experience influences students' capability to learn and their motivation for further learning. Although each student is different, standard instruction methods do not adapt to individual students. Adaptive learning reverses this practice and attempts to improve the student experience. While adaptive learning is well-established in programming, it is rarely used in cybersecurity education. This paper is one of the first works investigating adaptive learning in cybersecurity training. First, we analyze the performance of 95 students in 12 training sessions to understand the limitations of the current training practice. Less than half of the students (45 out of 95) completed the training without displaying any solution, and only in two sessions, all students completed all phases. Then, we simulate how students would proceed in one of the past training sessions if it would offer more paths of various difficulty. Based on this simulation, we propose a novel tutor model for adaptive training, which considers students' proficiency before and during an ongoing training session. The proficiency is assessed using a pre-training questionnaire and various in-training metrics. Finally, we conduct a case study with 24 students and new training using the proposed tutor model and adaptive training format. The results show that the adaptive training does not overwhelm students as the original static training format. In particular, adaptive training enables students to enter several alternative training phases with lower difficulty than the phases in the original training. The proposed adaptive format is not restricted to particular training used in our case study. Therefore, it can be applied to practicing any cybersecurity topic or even in other related computing fields, such as networking or operating systems. Our study indicates that adaptive learning is a promising approach for improving the student experience in cybersecurity education. We also highlight diverse implications for educational practice that improve students' experience. adaptive learning. case study. cybersecurity. evaluation. tutor model 
BUCEPHALUS: A BUsiness CEntric cybersecurity Platform for proActive anaLysis Using visual analyticS.Analyzing and mitigating the threats that cyber-attacks pose on the services of a critical infrastructure is not a trivial activity. Research solutions have been developed using data about the devices used for implementing the services, services dependencies, network topology, and the vulnerabilities that can be exploited to attack the network. However, most of the proposed solutions fail to consider these aspects in an integrated fashion, allowing the user to understand global dependencies and weaknesses. This paper contributes this issue with BUCEPHALUS, a Visual Analytics solution providing a) a visual overview of the existing relationships among business functions, devices, and vulnerabilities, and b) a what-if analysis scenario, in which the user is supported on making decisions on which vulnerabilities are more appropriate to fix.

Integrating Andragogy Theory into a Multidisciplinary Curriculum to Achieve a Connected Program for a Doctorate in Cybersecurity.This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a case study on constructing and implementing a connected program in the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) in Cybersecurity at Marymount University. We adapted a connected curriculum framework to this professional doctorate program based on two overarching pillars: andragogy theory and a multidisciplinary perspective. We use an andragogical instructional methodology that follows a learner-centered teaching philosophy to promote professional and adult learner engagement. Furthermore, the D.Sc. program takes a multidisciplinary approach to bridge and integrate domain-specific silos such as technology and its evolution, risk management, legal compliance, human factors, machine learning, business impact, and more. This integration helps enhance students' knowledge in multiple disciplinary specializations, focusing on problem-solving skills across the various domains important in cybersecurity. Building on these two pillars, our connected program model integrates five dimensions of connectivity to connect 1) academic learning and research with the workplace, 2) research activities and research-related curriculum over time, 3) various disciplines related to real-world cybersecurity challenges, 4) students with each other, across phases and with alumni, and 5) students with research and researchers across multiple domains. This paper's primary contribution is to demonstrate an innovative andrological and connected approach to tackle the ever-changing cybersecurity threats by cultivating the next generation of cybersecurity leaders with both advanced technical and refined management skills. We further showcase the potential of externalizing this framework in other settings and discuss future research work. Adult Learning Theory. Cybersecurity. Doctoral Students.

Cyber Security Threats Detection Analysis and Remediation.The devices of the organization such as laptops, desktops and mobiles are connected to the internet are vulnerable to cyber attacks, attacking on these components may lead to security breach, credential theft, malware implantation, DDoS attack, man in middle attacks, ransomware attacks and many more. Therefore, to defend against these attacks there requires proper security controls in place to detect the threats in the business environment. Security Threats generally propagates through various SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting or unauthorized excessive login into any servers. These could lead company to huge loss of information and revenue. Suspicious emails are the most dangerous way to attack on any organization by employing techniques such as phishing, fraud, Spam and spoofing the email headers. These emails are sent through outside company environment. It poses extensive threats and it can be a major setback. This work explores confident ways to automate the process of cyber security threat and change in a rules-set. With the help of proposed cyber tool to remediate false positives response time against every attack, these helps the organizations to minimize the suspicious attack. Attack. Cyber Security. Malware.

Automatic Narrative Summarization for Visualizing Cyber Security Logs and Incident Reports. Cyber security logs and incident reports describe a narrative, but in practice analysts view the data in tables where it can be difficult to follow the narrative. Narrative visualizations are useful, but common examples use a summarized narrative instead of the full story's narrative. it is unclear how to automatically generate these summaries. This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. Together, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Misérables character interaction graph. We find that the list of main characters in the automatically generated summary has substantial agreement with human-generated summaries.

Lessons Learnt Conducting Capture the Flag CyberSecurity Competition during COVID-19.This innovative practice full paper describes our experiences conducting cybersecurity capture the flag (CTF) competition for cybersecurity enthusiast participants (inclusive of both tertiary students and working professionals) local and abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning and appreciation of cybersecurity concepts for our participants with little to no technical background can be challenging. Gamification methods such as capture the flag competition style is a popular form of cybersecurity education to help participants overcome this challenge and identify talents. Participants get to apply theoretical concepts in a controlled environment, solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting and gain hands-on active learning experience. CTF competitions can be held at physical locations or virtually. However, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyses all major events that are traditionally held physically to go virtual (likewise for physical CTF events). The pandemic limits our physical interactions, changes the dynamics of our engagements with the participants and how participants learn. We have to adapt our CTF competition design and conduct it in a virtual format during the COVID-19 pandemic that is compliant with local pandemic regulations as well. This paper describes these adaptations for a semi-international CTF competition conducted for our participants. We conduct the competition entirely virtual and adapt the cybersecurity exercises to be attempted without the participant's physical presence. While we devise ways to validate participants' involvement, it is still more challenging to limit cheating than in a physical environment. However, with appropriate mitigating controls in place (reducing risks to acceptable levels), we were able to achieve similar outcomes compared to a physical event despite the lack of physical interactions. Over 1400 participants registered for our competition, and with the help of over 40 staff, we successfully conducted this 48 hours virtual CTF competition. We further analyse the participants' online activity during the competition, their survey responses after the competition and derive our lessons learnt. We hope that these experiences, analysis and findings are useful for educators or organisers who wish to adopt online CTF to improve the learning outcomes of teaching cybersecurity education. capture the flag.

Mirror Mirror on the Wall - What Are Cybersecurity Educational Games Offering Overall: A Research Study and Gap Analysis.Cybersecurity educational games are capable of meeting a variety of goals, including learning of fundamental cybersecurity concepts, exposure to cybersecurity literacy, basic awareness, experiential learning plus situational awareness, and being a medium for K-12 outreach, college level learning plus corporate training. Existing literature shows that there have been several prior research surveys focused on analyzing cybersecurity educational games from various viewpoints. However, to our knowledge, there has been no previous work that has analyzed cybersecurity educational games in terms of their alignment with the current benchmarks in academic and industry standards that include the cybersecurity curriculum plus assessment guidelines in higher education, the K-12 standardized cybersecurity concepts, and the cybersecurity job-related functions. In an effort to address this research gap, we use the CSEC2017 curricular guidelines, the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) model, the National Security Agency (NSA) GenCyber concepts and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework for performing a unique analysis of a list of popular cybersecurity educational games, plus a few Capture the Flag (CTF) instances. The list of cyber educational games, which we study, comprises of Anti-Phishing Phil, Cyber Awareness Challenge, Cyber CIEGE, Cyber Protect, Nsteens, NOVA Labs, What.Hack, PASDJO, CyberStart Go, OnGuardOnline, Safe Online Surfing, and Interland. This non-traditional survey-based research work demonstrates a novel, multi-faceted approach for analyzing popular opensource cybersecurity educational games in terms of their alignment with the standard academic and industry benchmarks. Our survey results include conceptual mapping of these cyber educational games to (1) the CSEC2017 curricular knowledge areas (Data Security, Software Security, Component Security, Connection Security, System Security, Human Security, Organizational Security and Societal Security), (2) the CATS concept inventory topics, including the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI), which pertains to basic first year college concepts, and the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA), which contains core concepts and learning outcomes for a college graduate, (3) the NSA GenCyber concepts (Defense in Depth, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Think Like an Adversary and Keep It Simple), and (4) NICE framework-based specialized skill sets (Analyze, Collect Operate, Investigate, Operate Maintain, Oversee Govern, Protect Defend and Securely Provision). Our research provides a first-of its kind study and a user-friendly analysis of open-source cybersecurity educational games that can serve as an insightful reference for cybersecurity educators and other audiences for using these games. Additionally, in this full research paper, we exhibit how the results of our study can be used for performing an overall gap analysis with cybersecurity educational games in terms which benchmarks they cover and which they do not.

The Evolution of Cyber Security Norm Development in the Digital Age.The development of normative cybersecurity behaviors in cyberspace plays a critical role in the resilience of the global digital supply chain. This case study takes a longitudinal approach in analyzing cyber norm development activities throughout 1997-2020. A total of 216 individual cases were collected, and 233 individual cyber norms were identified and compiled into 25 subject categories, allowing for a longitudinal view of cyber norm activities, and the changes of cyber norm developments over these years. This examination enables us to identify which cyber norms (if any) would work: norms with consistent activity across the timeline were considered successful, while those norms that disappeared completely or for long periods were considered unsuccessful. Considering such trends of success in cyber norm development allows for the prospect of a successful cybersecurity environment in the future. and guides the construction of cybersecurity governance in the digital age.
Evaluating hybrid quantum-classical deep learning for cybersecurity botnet DGA detection. Hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have potentials for current quantum computing technologies since only part of the model is computed by a quantum device. This paper proposes a novel hybrid quantum-classical deep learning model for cybersecurity application: domain generation algorithms (DGA)-based botnet detection. We analyzed our hybrid model's performance compared with the classical model counterpart to investigate the quantum circuit's effectivity as a layer in a deep learning model. We used four features of the Botnet DGA dataset: MinREBotnets, CharLength, TreeNewFeature, and nGramReputation_Alexa. The hybrid model's quantum circuit is a combination of Pennylane's embedding (Angle Embedding and IQP Embedding) and layers circuit (Basic Entangler Layers, Random Layers, and Strongly Entangling Layers). Also, we implemented noise models for assessing the applicability of the model for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology. We found that in some cases, the hybrid model reached high performance (maximum accuracy up to 94,7% using n=100. 93,9% using n=1,000). We discovered that the combination of Angle Embedding and Strongly Entangled delivers high accuracy, superior to the classical deep learning model in n=100 experiments). However, the overall performance is still inferior for the rest cases compared to the classical deep learning model counterpart. Botnet. Cybersecurity. DGA. Hybrid quantum deep learning. QML.

Cybersecurity architecture functional model for cyber risk reduction in IoT based wearable devices.In this paper, we propose a functional model for the implementation of devices that use the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, the number of devices connected to the internet per person has increased from 0.08 in 2003 to a total of 6.58 in 2020, suggesting an increase of 8,225% in 7 years. The proposal includes a functional IoT model of a cybersecurity architecture by including components to ensure compliance with the proposed controls within a cybersecurity framework to detect cyber threats in IoT-based wearable devices. The proposal focuses on reducing the number of vulnerabilities present in IoT devices since, on average, 57% of these devices are vulnerable to attacks. The model has a 3-layer structure: business, applications, and technology, where components such as policies, services and nodes are described accordingly. The validation was done through a simulated environment of a system for the control and monitoring of pregnant women using wearable devices. The results show reductions of the probability index and the impact of risks by 14.95% and 6.81% respectively. cyber risk reduction. Cybersecurity Architecture. Framework. Internet of Things.

Interpretable Identification of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities from News Articles.With the increasing adoption of technology, more and more systems become target to information security breaches. In terms of readily identifying zero-day vulnerabilities, a substantial number of news outlets and social media accounts reveal emerging vulnerabilities and threats. However, analysts often spend a lot of time looking through these decentralized sources of information in order to ensure up-to-date countermeasures and patches applicable to their organisation's information systems. Various automated processing pipelines grounded in Natural Language Processing techniques for text classification were introduced for the early identification of vulnerabilities starting from Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) data, including news websites, blogs, and social media. In this study, we consider a corpus of more than 1600 labeled news articles, and introduce an interpretable approach to the subject of cyberthreat early detection. In particular, an interpretable classification is performed using the Longformer architecture alongside prototypes from the ProSeNet structure, after performing a preliminary analysis on the Transformer's encoding capabilities. The best interpretable architecture achieves an 88% F2-Score, arguing for the system's applicability in real-life monitoring conditions of OSINT data.

To develop this proposal, existing frameworks and models have been taken as a reference, expanding their scope by integrating cloud security and privacy capabilities. In this way, the proposed model is supported by a measurement tool that facilitates diagnosis and result visualization. The evaluation process is performed based on the fulfillment of controls, which are evaluated on a scale of five levels of maturity: 1. Initial, 2. In Development, 3. Defined, 4. Managed and 5. Optimized. The results are grouped by domains and functions. The model was validated with pilot studies in two entities from the financial sector in Lima, Peru. In the performed validation, the preliminary results showed an average acceptance level of 4.3 on a 1 to 5 scale while the obtained maturity level was 3. Those preliminary results allowed us to propose activities which eliminate the gaps found as well as improve the organization's capabilities in the evaluated process. cloud computing. cybersecurity. financial sector. maturity model. privacy data 
Emotional Analysis of Learning Cybersecurity with Games.The constant rise of cyber-attacks poses an increasing demand for more qualified people with cybersecurity knowledge. Games have emerged as a well-fitted technology to engage users in learning processes. In this paper, we analyze the emotional parameters of people while learning cybersecurity through computer games. The data are gathered using a noninvasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to study the signals directly from the users' brains. We analyze six performance metrics (engagement, focus, excitement, stress, relaxation, and interest) of 12 users while playing computer games to measure the effectiveness of the games to attract the attention of the participants. Results show participants were more engaged with parts of the games that are more interactive instead of those that present text to read and type. cybersecurity. Emotional parameters. games

Cyber Security Awareness Game (CSAG) for Secondary School Students.The number of students having access to the Internet increased dramatically in the past 10 years. In Malaysia, a high percentage of secondary students owned a social media account and most of them spent more than five hours every day using such applications. The high usage on social media may expose them to cyber security risks such as cyberbullying and online harassment, inappropriate content of information, online privacy issues and easily get influenced by third party online. Youth today also lack skills in protecting their personal information online and tend to overshare personal information. Although there are many cyber security awareness programs held to motivate students to learn cyber security awareness, the students tend to forget after the seminar. Massive information taught at short period of time during cyber security awareness campaign caused memory retention issue. Therefore, CSAG is developed to attract the interest of students to learn cyber security awareness through games. U nity3D third player shooter game is developed and it allows players to replay or play anytime when they are free. Students are also allowed to check their learning progress and adjust based on their needs. Hence, secondary school students will be able to remember the best practice to be taken when using the Internet and implement this in real life while playing CSAG. cyber security awareness. cyberbullying. gamification. oversharing. safety downloading. web based application

Comparative analysis of Cybersecurity mechanisms in SD-WAN architectures: A preliminary results.Software-defined network in a wide area network (SD-WAN) has become a trend applied by large companies with geographically separated branches. The primary objective is based on a software solution that provides a cost-benefit balance, given the high cost of WAN connections. The growth of SD-WAN has brought numerous solutions by various vendors, but that has also increased the number of threats and vulnerabilities to this technology. This article aims to compare the commercial mechanisms versus opensource solutions implement within a specific architecture. It describes the cyber-attack vectors within SD-WAN and how to respond them within a simulation using the GNS3 software. The topology presented is based on a design with two branches and a headquarters, connected by two links that provide redundancy, one by MPLS and the other by broadband internet. The results of this research report that the commercial solution (Fortigate) provides better security mechanisms that focus on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, the open-source solution (Flexiwan) offers tools for adaptability to future threats thanks to the community's efforts. Cybersecurity. Flexiwan. Fortigate.

Cyber Security Model for Threat Hunting.Data privacy and encryption will still be top security priorities. Threat controls are countermeasures or safeguards used to reduce the chances that a threat will exploit a vulnerability as there is also a lack of understanding and a systematic model on which to base threat hunting operations and quantifying their effectiveness from the start of a threat hunt engagement to the end, as well as analytic rigour and completeness analysis. Threat hunting is a systematic method that aims to discover the location of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) in an area that has not yet been detected by current detection technologies. Using six stages: purpose, scope, equip, plan review, execute, and feedback, this research outlines a survey on this research. Cyber Security. Data Encryption. Threat Hunting. TTP-Based Hunting 
A PUF-based Approach for Sustainable Cybersecurity in Smart Agriculture.The simplicity, low cost, and scalability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have led researchers to study their applications in a wide range of areas such as Healthcare, Transportation, and Agriculture. IoT devices help farmers to monitor the conditions in a field. These are connected to edge devices for real-time analysis. The edge servers send commands to actuators in the farm directly, without human intervention. At the same time, security vulnerabilities are a big concern, concomitant with the increasing utilization of IoT devices. If the duplication of an IoT device occurs and attackers gain access to the system, then the integrity of the entire ecosystem will be at stake, regardless of the application domain. This paper presents a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based hardware security primitive for the authentication of Internet of Agro-Things (IoAT) devices. The proposed security scheme has been prototyped with a testbed evaluation. An arbiter PUF module has been used for the validation of the proposed scheme. The PUF based security primitive is lightweight, scalable, and robust as it mainly depends on inherent manufacturing variations, thereby ensuring no chance for the duplication of IoT devices.

A Literature Review of Machine Learning Techniques for Cybersecurity in Data Centers.Currently, information and communication technologies (ICT) are an essential part of almost any business sector and, therefore, are the target of different cyberattacks. ICT security measures are necessary to protect information from unauthorized access. These measures include network monitoring, threat detection, and prevention. Machine learning is an important part of cybersecurity solutions that allows us to automatically analyze data patterns and learn from them to prevent similar attacks or to predict possible threats. This paper provides a literature review that summarizes different machine learning techniques and feature sets used in cybersecurity for an ICT system security analysis. cybersecurity. deep learning. network analysis. supervised machine learning. unsupervised machine learning 
A Stochastic Network-Interdiction Model for Cyber Security.We propose a general defender-attacker model for security of computer networks, using attack graphs to represent the possible attacker strategies and defender options. The defender's objective is to maximize the security of the network under a limited budget. In computer security, the attacker could be operating from the safety of a foreign country, and the cost of changing attack strategies may be quite low. To capture the ability of the attacker to launch multiple attempts, we represent the attacker's success on each arc of the attack graph probabilistically, and formulate the resulting problem as a two- stage stochastic NI problem. We solve the resulting problem using two-stage stochastic optimization with recourse, and explore the attacker and defender strategies. attack graphs.

Towards the Consolidation of Cybersecurity Standardized Definitions: a Tool for Ontological Analysis.Cybersecurity is defined as information technology security and today managing all the elements involved in this domain is usually quite complex and immense. It is for this reason that companies keep actively looking for efficient and solid solutions in this matter. One of the solutions used by organizations to explore security between assets and possible attacks is Knowledge Graphs (KG). In this context, large amounts of data are generated, which can yield misinterpretations of the results (information) if the data meaning not well characterized and conceptualized. To facilitate an innovative solution to this problem based on KG, this work seeks to facilitate a characterization of the domain supported by the best practices of Conceptual Modeling (specifically in the branch of Ontologies). This paper focuses on conducting studies that allow us to expand our terminological approach, thus generating a large amount of data that allows us to provide a software solution (REST-API) for managing domain data (using NoSQL technologies). Thanks to this ontological analysis platform, the correct use in the development and implementation of KGs by stakeholders will be guaranteed. Cybersecurity Ontologies. Knowledge Graphs.

Research on Cybersecurity Strategy and Key Technology of the Wind Farms' Industrial Control System. Affected by the inherent ideas like  Focus on Function Realization, Despise Security Protection , there are lots of hidden threats in the industrial control system of wind farms (ICS-WF), such as unreasonable IP configuration, failure in virus detection and killing, which are prone to illegal invasion and attack from the cyberspace. Those unexpected unauthorized accesses are quite harmful for the stable operation of the wind farms and regional power grid. Therefore, by investigating the current security situation and needs of ICS-WF, analyzing the characteristics of ICS-WF's architecture and internal communication, and integrating the ideas of the classified protection of cybersecurity, this paper proposes a new customized cybersecurity strategy for ICS-WF based on the barrel theory. We also introduce an new anomalous intrusion detection technology for ICS-WF, which is developed based on statistical models of wind farm network characteristics. Finally, combined all these work with the network security offense and defense drill in the industrial control safety simulation laboratory of wind farms, this research formulates a three-dimensional comprehensive protection solution for ICS-WF, which significantly improves the cybersecurity level of ICS-WF.

Towards the development of the cybersecurity concept according to ISO/SAE 21434 using model-based systems engineering.Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles, are intelligent and networked. Close collaboration between stakeholders from different disciplines is necessary right from the start of development. In the automotive sector in particular, the collaboration of the car manufacturer extends to several suppliers. The increasing complexity in the design of such CPSs makes interdisciplinary and cross-company collaboration more difficult. Here, requirements specifications serve as a support for communication. A lack of overall understanding of such CPSs and their numerous interfaces jeopardizes the assurance of safety-relevant security. ISO/SAE 21434, which applies to the automotive industry, requires the creation of a cybersecurity concept at the beginning of the product development process. The problem is that ISO/SAE 21434 only prescribes WHAT must be done, but does not define HOW this is supposed to be done methodically.Existing methods are not applicable to the concept phase without extensive tailoring, according to the challenges I identified in this paper and the literature review I conducted. Furthermore, I present four papers I have written and four papers I plan to write, which serve as building blocks for the required overall method. Finally, I explain how I plan to evaluate my approach. Cyber-physical systems. ISO/SAE 21434. Requirements engineering. Safety. Security 
Autonomous and Electrical Vehicles Development using Optimized Processes Defined by Cyber Security and Safety Management System.The current trend in automotive is to develop electrical and autonomous vehicles (EVAV). The paper presents an original concept which can be used to develop AVEV, but the same concept can be used also for classical vehicles. The work paper begins with a brief review on the evolution of safety and cyber security standards applicable in the automotive industry. Most of the players in the automotive market do not have dedicated processes for safety and for cybersecurity. The authors propose a list of processes developed based on ISO 26262[1] and ISO/SAE 21434[2] requirements. Beside this proposal they are coming with an innovative concept which is coming into one integrated system called CSSMS (Cybersecurity and Safety Management System). This concept has as main purpose the reduction of time and resources used for development but also the fulfillment of all the requirements of the standards. In the end the concept proposed is partially validated using a steering product and proposes some steps for validating the entire system. autonomous vehicle. cost. cybersecurity.

Towards the Integration of Cybersecurity Risk Assessment into Model-based Requirements Engineering.Engineering projects requires to consider the increasingly significant needs and constraints regarding expected behaviors, services, quality and security. These requirements are introduced into system and software engineering projects as functional and non-functional properties. Satisfying such properties implies rigorous processes that steer the project, from the requirements identification and definition to the system deployment and maintenance. Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) is an effective approach to address security requirements and risk assessment at the early stages of the development life cycle, which enables cost-efficient fixes. The aim of this work is to investigate how cybersecurity risk assessment could be integrated into model-based requirement engineering. We propose a Model-based Cyberisk Assessment (MBCA) method, that comprises: (1) A semantic alignment between risk assessment concepts and system modeling concepts and (2) A modeling language extension to represent security concepts and metrics throughout the system modeling life cycle. To illustrate our approach, validate its applicability and evaluate its expressiveness, we applied it to an industrial in-flight entertainment system. Model-Based Systems Engineering.

A Cyber Security Risk Assessment Methodology for CBTC Systems Based on Complex Network Theory and Attack Graph.Cyber security risk assessment is very important to quantify the security level of communication-based train control (CBTC) systems. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to assess the cyber security risk of CBTC systems that integrates complex network theory and attack graph method. On one hand, in order to determine the impact of malicious attacks on train control, we analyze the connectivity of movement authority (MA) paths based on the working state of nodes, the connectivity of edges. On the other hand, attack graph is introduced to quantify the probabilities of potential attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities in the cyber world of CBTC. Experiments show that our methodology can assess the security risks of CBTC systems and improve the security level after implementing reinforcement schemes. attack graph. communication-based train control. complex network theory. cyber security risk assessment 
Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on E-learning Student's Dropout Levels during Cybersecurity Programs: A Case Study.As the COVID-19 pandemic shakes the human society, most fields had to adapt to online systems in order to keep operating. Such is the case of the Education field, where e-learning became the main (and sometimes the only) tool available to ensure that teaching activities could continue. This work analyzes the case of a cybersecurity program taught online in Chile from 2019 to this day. The available data allowed us to observe some of the impacts that the pandemic had on the student's dropout levels, highlighting some difference between the early months of the pandemic, versus later periods in time.

Cybersecurity as the protection of cyberspace.Humans in the 21st century engage in technology mediated communication much of our lives. It has become a dimension of human existence, and since the COVID-19 pandemic is found increasingly in work, study, and leisure. If we search for a meaning in this communication message, we may describe the totality of this communication technology as cyberspace. Cyberspace is a combination of mass media and technology in a new form. Complete with its own practices, behaviors, and manifestos, functioning cyberspace can be considered a global basis of human existence in the same way as unpolluted air or the absence of a pandemic. While cyberspace is resistant to totalizing control, it is nevertheless fragile, and requires protection if humans are to achieve its benefits. Cybersecurity can be considered simply the protection of immediate, practical and ongoing technology elements. Yet to protect any part of cyberspace, it is necessary to protect all of cyberspace. cybersecurity. Cyberspace. digital. on-line. technology trust

Model-based Cybersecurity Analysis: Past Work and Future Directions. Model-based evaluation in cybersecurity has a long history. Attack Graphs (AGs) and Attack Trees (ATs) were the earlier developed graphical security models for cybersecurity analysis. However, they have limitations (e.g., scalability problem, state-space explosion problem, etc.) and lack the ability to capture other security features (e.g., countermeasures). To address the limitations and to cope with various security features, a graphical security model named attack countermeasure tree (ACT) was developed to perform security analysis by taking into account both attacks and countermeasures. In our research, we have developed different variants of a hierarchical graphical security model to solve the complexity, dynamicity, and scalability issues involved with security models in the security analysis of systems. In this paper, we summarize and classify security models into the following. graph-based, tree-based, and hybrid security models. We discuss the development of a hierarchical attack representation model (HARM) and different variants of the HARM, its applications, and usability in a variety of domains including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Software- Defined Networking, and Moving Target Defenses. Moreover, we discuss the pros and cons of each variant of HARM based on its applications and usage. Furthermore, several security metrics have been developed to be used with the graphical security model (including HARMs) to analyze the security posture of the systems and evaluate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms which is also being taken as input into optimization algorithms to compute optimal defense deployment. Thus, we provide the classification of the security metrics, including their discussions. Finally, we highlight existing problems and suggest future research directions in the area of graphical security models and applications. As a result of this work, a decision-maker can understand which type of HARM will suit their network or security analysis requirements. Attack Graphs. Attack Trees. Evaluation. Moving Target Defense.

Sec4ML: An approach to support Cybersecurity Data Publishing for Machine Learning tasks.Despite the exponential growth of the World Wide Web since its creation, there are still few available datasets of cybersecurity incidents to be reused due to several issues, such as privacy-preserving concerns and data publication format standardization. As a result, the domain incidents analysis are precarious impacting on the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development. The LOD (Linked Open Data) practices, which allows the sharing of data on the Web as a large and interconnected data graph, together with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, which guides the publication of data for reuse, can support the sharing of cybersecurity incidents datasets. Furthermore, anonymization techniques can be used to handle privacy concerns. Moreover, Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to improve IDS effectiveness. This article proposes the Sec4ML approach which supports the preparation of cybersecurity incident datasets for ML techniques using LOD practices and following FAIR principles, involving, among others, anonymization and preprocessing subprocesses, which are illustrated using data extracted from the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

Studying The Perception of Using Visualization Dashboard to Measure Cybersecurity Maturity Stage.At the current stage, the complexity of digital threat has increased along with the exponential changes in the technology's advancement. Moreover, the infrastructure for technology continuously improves through the border of security measures well beyond controls of the organization. To resolve this concern, assessment of cybersecurity maturity on dashboard is proposed to facilitate cybersecurity implementation plan and make it easier for organization to improve their cybersecurity through visual cues. This article aims to study the Technology Acceptance Model on the acceptance of Maturity Dashboard and examine the proposed research model framework. Through the adaptation of TAM based questionnaire of Visual Dashboard for Cybersecurity Maturity, the research will be able to gauge the proper visualization dashboard design suitable for employees in MNC companies of ICT industry and thence, comes up with a visualization dashboard which caters to the requirements specified by the employees.

A Customizable Web Platform to Manage Standards Compliance of Information Security and Cybersecurity Auditing.Information security and cybersecurity are key subjects in modern enterprises' management, being ISO-27001:2013, NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO-27009 some of the most implemented international frameworks and standards. Their main goal is to globally reduce the risk, by leveraging enterprises' competitiveness in global markets and enhancing business processes and collaborators' cyber awareness. Auditing processes examine and assess a list of predefined controls. For each control, a set of corrective measures could be proposed, to increase its compliance with the standard being used. These processes are time-consuming, involve on-site intervention by specialized consulting teams on the intervened enterprises, and a set of status reports of all the interventions should be elaborated and delivered. The existing auditing information systems are not developed to meet Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) requirements, as they are mostly proprietary and expensive, ground usually on off-the-shelf applications, and are not generic to be used by several standards with different checklists and auditing methodologies. In this paper, a generic and web-integrated cybersecurity auditing information system is described. Its architecture, design, and data model enable it to be used in a wide set of auditing processes, by loading a predefined controls checklist assessment and their corresponding mitigation tasks list. It was designed to meet both SMEs and large enterprises' requirements, and stores auditing and intervention-related data in a relational database. The information system was tested on an ISO-27001:2013 information security auditing project, which has integrated fifty SMEs. The results obtained during the project are promising and reveal the appropriateness of using this information system in further similar auditing processes. Auditing. Cybersecurity.

Cheat Detection In Cyber Security Capture The Flag Games - An Automated Cyber Threat Hunting Approach.Capture-the-flag style cyber security games (CTF) are one of the most popular ways of learning and teaching ethical hacking. These CTF games usually present a set of hacking tasks or challenges that simulate a vulnerability to be compromised. When the participant compromises the vulnerability they are presented with a secret flag that is uploaded to prove a participants completion of a challenge. Whilst this secret flag confirms successful completion of a challenge, it does little to verify the legitimacy of a participant's activities. We propose a process for plagiarism detection in web application CTF games via automated cyber threat hunting techniques. Using log data captured from penetration testing courses, we develop a series of indicators of compromise for each CTF challenge that are attributed to a participant's activities. We develop an automated querying tool that interfaces with the Elastic Stack to query these IOCs for classifying participant activities as suspicious or benign without false positives.

Cybersecurity for Flight Deck Data Exchange.Recent flight deck advancements include rapidly expanding applications for Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs), high-bandwidth air-ground data links using Internet Protocols (IP), and the introduction of Aircraft Interface Devices (AIDs) that connect legacy avionics busses, EFBs, and the IP communication links. These advances allow the flight deck to participate in system-wide information sharing and enable pilots to more fully and collaboratively participate in air traffic management decision making. However, the introduction of these connected aircraft systems potentially expose the applications and networks on board the aircraft to a variety of new cybersecurity threats. This paper reviews a generic networked aircraft architecture that uses the EFB, AID IP Data Links to implement two sample applications and performs a qualitative cybersecurity analysis on the resulting system. The cybersecurity analysis assumes typical aviation security measures are in place and is used to identify any residual risks and makes recommendations for additional security measures where required. air traffic services. communications. connected aircraft. cybersecurity.

Research and Application of Risk Assessment Method for Automotive Cybersecurity.Automobile intelligent driving systems and communication services bring the widespread application of information technology and network technology. Meanwhile, there are increasing number of exploitable security vulnerabilities and risks in modern vehicles. These risks may cause serious consequences such as casualties and property losses for drivers. Risk assessment is an important activity in the life cycle of automobile cybersecurity and can provide a guarantee for the formation of correct cybersecurity requirements of products. Considering the current wide recognition standard for threat analysis and risk assessment, this paper proposes a systematic risk assessment method for automotive cybersecurity combined with risk assessment use cases. Finally, a typical use case of security-related component IVI is applied to illustrate the proposed risk assessment method and analysis process of cybersecurity assessment results.
Impact Analysis of PLC Performance When Applying Cyber Security Solutions Using Active Information Gathering.ICS Controllers such as the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED), and Remote Terminal Units (RTU) are the primary components responsible for the operation of a control system. Dedicated security solutions are required to protect these devices from advanced cyber threats. Security solutions which operate passively are gradually being introduced into the Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, most utilities are opposed to the installation of security solutions which actively generate requests to the devices owing to maintenance contracts or concerns about device malfunctions. To overcome these issues, it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the impact of the security solutions on the control device. This study proposes a detailed analysis procedure considering the characteristics of the controllers. The experimental results are shared using a CompactLogix PLC to help stakeholders aiming to strengthen the security of their control devices. ICS security. Performance impact analysis. PLC 
Link Prediction for Cybersecurity Companies and Technologies: Towards a Survivability Score.On the cybersecurity market, novel entities – technologies and companies – arise and disappear swiftly. In such a fast-paced context, assessing the survivability of those entities is crucial when it comes to make investment decisions for ensuring the security of critical infrastructures. In this paper, we present a framework for capturing the dynamic relationship between entities of the Swiss cybersecurity landscape. By using open data, we first model our dataset as a bipartite graph in which nodes are represented by technologies and companies involved in cybersecurity. Next, we use patents and job openings data to link the two entities. By extracting time series of such graphs, and by using link-prediction methods, we forecast the (dis)appearance of links. We apply several unsupervised learning similarity-based algorithms, a supervised learning method and finally we select the best model. Our preliminary results show good performance and promising validation of our survivability index. We suggest that our framework is useful for critical infrastructure operators, as a survivability index of entities can be extracted by using the outputs of our models.

A Cybersecurity Curricular Framework for IT Undergraduates in South Africa.Many organisations have reported a dramatic shortage of cybersecurity skills to counteract cyberattacks. Academia and industry should be responsible for working together to investigate possibilities in closing this cybersecurity skills gap. The IT curricula of many South African universities are based on the outdated IT2008 curricular guidelines, which make no mention of cybersecurity. In order to address this increasing cybersecurity skills gap, universities offering computer-related qualifications need to adapt their curricula accordingly. This paper proposes a framework for integrating cybersecurity into IT undergraduate curricula in South Africa. As the cybersecurity needs of industry continue to evolve, the proposed framework will provide a structure that aligns IT curricula to the cybersecurity workforce needs by considering the NIST NICE framework, CSEC2017, and IT2017. Furthermore, the proposed framework discussed in this paper will serve as an academic guide for communicating cybersecurity content to address specific industry work roles. The implementation of this IT Cybersecurity Curricular Framework aims to impact the development of the cybersecurity workforce positively and reduce the cybersecurity skills gap between academia and industry.

Novel Maturity Model for Cybersecurity Evaluation in Industry 4.0.The opportunities offered by Industry 4.0 for manufacturing companies are enormous but are in danger of remaining unexploited due to inadequate IT security measures. Increasing networking in the production environment leads to a growing number of attack surfaces that need to be protected by appropriate security measures. The overarching goal of this paper is therefore to provide companies with an easy-to-use tool with which they can self-assess their own cybersecurity maturity level, identify vulnerabilities and, based on this, implement secure, digitally networked production themselves. The Fraunhofer IPT has therefore developed the Production Security Readiness Check, which is presented in this article and the result of a study of 28 companies that have carried out the check is highlighted.

Communicating Cybersecurity Vulnerability Information: A Producer-Acquirer Case Study.The increase in both the use of open-source software (OSS) and the number of new vulnerabilities reported in this software constitutes an increased threat to businesses, people, and our society. To mitigate this threat, vulnerability information must be efficiently handled in organizations. In addition, where e.g., IoT devices are integrated into systems, such information must be disseminated from producers, who are implementing patches and new firmware, to acquirers who are responsible for maintaining the systems. We conduct an exploratory case study with one producer of IoT devices and one acquirer of the same devices, where the acquirer integrates the devices into larger systems. Through this two-sided case study, we describe company roles, internal and inter-company communication, and the decisions that need to be made with regard to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We also identify and discuss both challenges and opportunities for improvements, from the point of view of both the producer and acquirer. Case study. Cybersecurity. IoT. Open-source software.

Game-based learning for cybersecurity awareness training programmes in the public sector.This paper aims to identify an effective and sustainable learning experience by designing a users’ experience model on the cybersecurity awareness for public sector using game-based learning. Efforts driven to build cybersecurity awareness to community is as important as strengthening the public sectors’ (government) capacity in dealing with cybersecurity threats. Public sectors’ capacity to use electronic systems should move in parallel with the awareness and ability to protect these. In most organizations, if not all, the topic of cybersecurity awareness is the initial touch point to educate employees on various fields. Learning from a cybersecurity awareness training can only be effective if done in a safe environment where repetitive failure is seen as input for learning optimization. A simulated environment for practice can facilitate the transfer of learned theories to practice. Reinforcing the learning content with innovative learning experience and digital technologies like (serious) games can make learning more effective and engaging. This study provides a survey of online serious games used in cybersecurity awareness and analysis of the motivational core drives used in the game mapped through the Octalysis framework. While the Octalysis gamification framework is widely used in the design of serious games, it is still rarely implemented to tackle cybersecurity challenges. This paper demonstrates the connection of cybersecurity awareness trainings to motivational factors and the help of a systematic approach, such as Octalysis framework, in comparing the various aspects of different awareness programmes. The paper also presents results from the key informant interviews from experts and implementors of cybersecurity awareness programmes, and serious games on key consideration to integrate the cybersecurity awareness initiatives and game-based learning to improve learning outcomes. The study gathers user journey experience from public sector to sustain their learning experience. Finally, the study presents a users’ experience design which can optimize learning and sustain learning experience in cybersecurity awareness with game-based approach. Cybersecurity awareness.

Examining attitudes towards cybersecurity compliance through the lens ofthe psychological contract.This research proposal defines the aim to explore the perceptions and experiences of employees through a global pandemic. In an exploratory qualitative study, utilising thematic analysis, the intention is to take an interpretivist position to examine participants' accounts of working from home during a pandemic, by looking through the psychological contract (Rousseau, 1996a) lens to better understand this phenomenon. This research serves to offer a potential line of enquiry when it comes to the human factors of cyber and information security behaviour and any themes which may overlap with psychological contract breaches (PCB). Previous research has suggested that the psychological contract can impact on employee commitment towards their organisations (Jabeen, Behery and Hossam, 2015), and employees' attitudes towards cyber security affect the frequency in engaging in risky online behaviours, (Hadlington, 2018), this study aims to draw out any themes around these areas through semi-structured interviews with employees in a global law firm.

A comprehensive survey on big data technology based cybersecurity analytics systems.The traffic data in Internet is enormous as most of the population in the world uses Internet nowadays. Due to the improvement in the speed of modern communication links in Internet, huge volume of traffic data can be generated in a small amount of time. These two aspects characterize Internet traffic data as Big Data. The proper analysis of traffic data helps network administrators in managing their network and cybersecurity professionals to identify security events in their network. Recently, many cybersecurity systems leveraging big data technologies for examining security events have been developed at both academic and industry. These systems need to process a huge amount of packet captures (PCAP) to detect and mitigate security attacks. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey on Big Data Technology based Cybersecurity Analytics (BDTCA) system that utilizes big data technologies for analyzing security events. This survey paper identifies the various big data technologies, datasets and feature selection algorithms that are used in BDTCA systems. This paper also reports different methods that are used to read packet trace files from Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Finally, observations, recommendations and future directions in the area of BDTCA systems are presented. Big data. Cybersecurity. Hadoop. HDFS. Network. PCAP 
Searching for the strong AI for cybersecurity.Currently, the creation of strong artificial intelligence (eng. Strong Artificial Intelligence (AI)) to ensure the required cybersecurity of digital platforms Industry 4.0 is one of the most interesting scientific and technical problems of our time. In the 1940s, when Norbert Wiener's book Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and in the Machine, and other scientific papers on this topic were published, when the first computers of the von Neumann architecture appeared and began to be distributed. The mentioned problem was transferred from the field of science fiction to the field of real theoretical research and engineering developments. Since then, experts in the field of cyber security have been eagerly awaiting the emergence of fundamentally new technical information protection systems, the level of intelligence of which will be comparable to that of humans. That is, such engineering solutions, the distinctive ability of which will be the independent association and synthesis of new knowledge. Let's take a brief look at the history of the issue and dwell in more detail on the possible formulation of tasks for creating strong cybersecurity artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence.

Translating space cybersecurity policy into actionable guidance for space vehicles. Actionable guidance is currently lacking for space system developers, mission owners, and operators concerning cybersecurity threats and defensive countermeasures. Existing policy guidance is too abstract to address cybersecurity threats in a tangible manner. Conversely, extremely specific and technical lists of security controls for space systems without traceability to mission needs, nor alternative defensive solutions, stifles efforts to ensure controls are being implemented effectively and commensurate with the threats space systems face. This paper assists space system designers and operators to tailor cybersecurity guidance to their specific systems. In this paper, existing cybersecurity guidance that has been vetted for other industries is highlighted and applied to the space vehicle domain, where applicable. Identification of gaps in existing guidance where space vehicle-specific concepts are necessary is also addressed. A streamlined decision tree process to guide space system developers and operators through security considerations to address cybersecurity in a holistic manner is proposed. Sample mission-specific security guidance and recommendations are proposed to demonstrate the use of the decision tree. As threats evolve and cyber capabilities change over time, the specific guidance identified in the example may require modification. yet the decision process proposed should remain intact.

The linkstar cybersecurity sandbox-a platform to test cubesat vulnerabilities within the small satellite community.Cubesats are becoming ubiquitous in Low Earth Orbit with operators ranging from the U.S. Government to commercial businesses, university teams and even hobbyists. However cubesats are vulnerable to range of cyberattacks on the ground segment, the link segment and the Space Segment. Testing and understanding the range of threats to all segments of a cubesat mission can be daunting, especially for teams that are not well funded or lack the resources for test and development. sci_Zone with the AIAA and the Aerospace Cybersecurity Working Group created the LinkStar Cybersecurity Cubesat Test Platform, a sandbox to test vulnerabilities a cubesat can experience. The LinkStar Cybersecurity Cubesat Test Platform, open to qualified members in the satellite community, is to provide a sandbox to continually probe a range of vulnerabilities for all mission segments and to share the results and lessons learned back to the cubesat community. The LinkStar Cybersecurity Cubesat Test Platform provides all three segments to test and probe and utilizes an actual cubesat on the ground with an operational space based communications system. For this presentation will present the architecture, and how a team can gain access to test, learn, probe and try to hack the satellite.
Multi-paradigmatic approaches in cybersecurity economics.In cybersecurity economics, the selection of a particular methodology is a matter of interest and importance for the researchers. Methodologically sophisticated research forms an essential basis for understanding the challenges and opportunities for the richer descriptions of the behavior of cybersecurity practitioners (i.e., what they are doing and why they are doing it). This requires a broad and self-reflective approach to understand the use of a technique in socio-technical research within cybersecurity economics. Such understanding recognizes that research in this field involves more than just applying a method to create knowledge and diffuse it throughout society, organizations, and governments. This paper argues in favor of a multi-paradigmatic approach to cybersecurity economics research. Rather than adopting a single paradigm, this study suggests that results will be more prosperous and reliable if different methods from different existing paradigms are combined. Hence, it puts forward the desirability and feasibility of the multi-paradigmatic approach in cybersecurity economics research. It also outlines several practical guidelines that help design multi-paradigmatic research studies. These are illustrated with a critical evaluation of three examples of studies.

Consulting the Oracle at Delphi – Combining risk I and risk in cyber security.Risk may be analyzed implicitly or explicitly. From industrial experience, the former is less commonly used than the latter on a day-to-day basis, even though the former makes up the primary content of most commercially available risk analysis and management methodologies. Paradoxically, the latter is also more commonly baked into the process and technology used by organizations and its culture of risk management. Hence this represents a sociotechnical issue which requires the resolution of both conflict of methods and ambiguity in the interpretation and application of risk analysis. We propose an approach for resolving these issues, based on experience in the wild, and creating a Delphic convergence between the results of both approaches. Ultimately, we would aim to create a methodology for this purpose and propose some criteria for its creation. Analysis. Cyber security. Risk. Sociotechnical 
Is cyber-security the new lifeboat? An exploration of the employee’s perspective of cyber-security within the cruise ship industry.After the International Maritime Organisation introduced the Maritime Cyber Risk Management in Safety Management Systems Resolution in 2017, with the compliance date set for January 2021, the Maritime industry has displayed an increased focus on its cyber-security. This quantitative research, supported by the socio-technical perspective, explores the employee perceptions of cyber-security onboard cruise ships. The results show that the cruise industry has made an attempt to increase its cyber-security by introducing a formal policy and training their employees. Employees, as a consequence, perceive cyber-security to be important. However, employee perceptions are not reflective of their behaviours onboard. This is because there are various technical and organizational obstacles to their cyber-security practices which have been overlooked. As a result, the cruise industry could do more to prioritise cyber-security on a day-to-day level in order to make sure that the employee experience is in alignment with cyber-security policies.

Design considerations for developing a game-based learning resource for cyber security education.An effective cyber-security training calls for change of behaviour that requires more than providing information about risks and reactive behaviours as in existing instructional approach. This involves complementing traditional lectures with active learning experiences. The young learners that are exposed to digital technologies all their lives, often referred to as'Millennials' (Brinkworth et al, 2009) are not particularly motivated by traditional, one-way lecture/presentation-based learning within the classroom setting. Consequently, there is an increasing pressure on educators to promote student engagement by being not just deliverers of content, but facilitators of the learning process (Hamari et al, 2004). This is often accomplished through active learning strategies such as the flipped classroom, technology integration and use of game-based learning methods. In this paper, we present the design considerations for developing game-based learning resources for cyber security education within the higher education setting. The discussion in this paper is based on the experience of designing a cyber security game for a second-year cyber security module to introduce concepts penetration testing and information gathering to students. The paper explores the challenges in designing a game-based learning resource for cyber security education. The particular focus is on the impact of using game jams and student-centric co-creation methods in game design. The paper further elaborates on how the learning objectives and pedagogical intent were mapped to the appropriate game mechanics during the game design process ensuring the game-based learning resource do not compromise on learning. The paper presents initial results of field-trialling the game among 16-17 year old learners. Co-creation. Cyber security game. Game-based-learning. Student-centric 
BioSecure Digital Twin: Manufacturing Innovation and Cybersecurity Resilience.U.S. national security, prosperity, economy, and well-being require secure, flexible, and resilient Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing. The COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed that the biomedical production value-chain is vulnerable to disruption and has been under attack from sophisticated nation-state adversaries. Current cyber defenses are inadequate, and the integrity of critical production systems and processes are inherently vulnerable to cyber-attacks, human error, and supply chain disruptions. The following chapter explores how a BioSecure Digital Twin will improve U.S. manufacturing resilience and preparedness to respond to these hazards by significantly improving monitoring, integrity, security, and agility of our manufacturing infrastructure and systems. The BioSecure Digital Twin combines a scalable manufacturing framework with a robust platform for monitoring and control to increase U.S. biopharma manufacturing resilience. Then, the chapter discusses some of the inherent vulnerabilities and challenges at the nexus of health and advanced manufacturing. Next, the chapter highlights that as the Pandemic evolves, we need agility and resilience to overcome significant obstacles. This section highlights an innovative application of Cyber Informed Engineering to developing and deploying a BioSecure Digital Twin to improve the resilience and security of the biopharma industrial supply chain and production processes. Finally, the chapter concludes with a process framework to complement the Digital Twin platform, called the Biopharma (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) OODA Loop Framework (BOLF), a four-step approach to decision-making outputs from the Digital Twin. The BOLF will help end users leverage twin technology by distilling the available information, focusing the data on context, and rapidly making the best decision while remaining cognizant of changes that can be made as more data becomes available.

Conceptual Model for a Shared Cybersecurity Operations Center for ICS.The article offers an analysis of the scope of a conceptual model for a Shared Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Cybersecurity Operations Center (SCOC). It ensures continuous proportional ICS protection against malicious actors and in accordance with regulations and standards. The focus of the research is on the three basic functions of the cybersecurity cycle – proactive functions, security operations management, and cybersecurity incident response. The aim of the study is to increase the effectiveness of cybersecurity for all Shared SOC subscribers, to overcome the problem of staff shortages, and allow each company to focus on its core business. The proposed analysis provides reference points for synthesizing a private solution for multiple clients of Shared SOC, a basis for the concept of operations and preparation for technical design. Shared SOC provides a powerful tool for meeting the requirement for multi-layered cyber protection, which is already a fact in many regulatory measures. Shared SOC creates conditions for all subscribers with ICS to increase their level of maturity in cybersecurity. Our contribution is in determining the meta scope of operations performed by the SCOC team. Center. centre. Cyber. ICS. Operations. Security. Shared 
On ICS cybersecurity assessment with the help of delay calculation.Today, cybersecurity is a well-known concept systematically manipulated in the context of corporative and personal life. Many stormy debates on reducing cyberthreats are sparked off in every single IT security event. A multitude of techniques for preventing cyberattacks are utilized daily. However, most of these cyber considerations and appropriate methods are hyper-focused on threats and attacks themselves and have very little concern about how to make an adequate quantitative cybersecurity estimation. The article presents a mathematically valid approach for the cybersecurity assessment. Unlike the majority of cybersecurity analyses considering globally connected devices, the presented solution deals with industrial control systems and their local area networks and does not regard the Internet. Demonstrating availability as the most critical property of cybersecurity in the control system context and carrying out a survey of availability definitions, the IEC 62443 availability interpretation is elected as the most suitable for the quantitative evaluation. A delay of the signal transmission from a source to a receiver is used as a measure of the assessment. For calculations, a theory of deterministic queueing systems Network calculus is utilized. Two issues associated with delays are raised in the article. The first one, when the arrival flow is known, a standard technique for the delay calculation can be used. The second, when the arrival flow is unavailable, a delay calculation from a backlog bound can be carried out. The first technique helps to solve the general problem of how potential cyberattacks affect system availability, and the second, the problem of process scheduling. Availability. Backlog. Cyberattack.

Cybersecurity for quantum computing.With rising cyberattack frequency and range, Quantum Computing companies, institutions and research groups may become targets of nation state actors, cybercriminals and hacktivists for sabotage, espionage and fiscal motivations as the Quantum computing race intensifies. Quantum applications have expanded into commercial, classical information systems and services approaching the necessity to protect their networks, software, hardware and data from digital attacks. This paper discusses the status quo of quantum computing technologies and the quantum threat associated with it. We proceed to outline threat vectors for quantum computing systems and the respective defensive measures, mitigations and best practices to defend against the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We subsequently propose recommendations on how to proactively reduce the cyberattack surface through threat intelligence and by ensuring security by design of quantum software and hardware components.

Casting a wide net: An internet of things testbed for cybersecurity education and research.The last few years have seen an explosive growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) as billions of new low-powered devices are connected to the network in every sector, from household items to sensors, healthcare devices, and industrial controls. Devices often rely on vertical architectures, with each type of device requiring a separate platform for control, data sharing, and storage. New horizontal architectures are needed to allow sharing of resources between devices to optimize hardware efficiency. In addition, new networking paradigms such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) are required to efficiently manage increased delay-sensitive network demand. This broad range of new technologies and skills make entry difficult for students and new researchers, and innovative practical testbeds for IoT systems and SDN will be required for training and research. We propose an IoT testbed with multiple networking layers and heterogeneous devices to simultaneously support networking research, anomaly detection, and security principles applied specifically to IoT for education and research, providing a complex yet practical hands-on environment made entirely of open-source tools and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) materials that can be replicated for use by others seeking to build such a system.

A Look at Usability, Accessibility and Cybersecurity Standards in Software Development.The access and use of the websites regardless of the hardware, software, geographic location or network infrastructures available to the user, are a necessity and topics addressed in the usability and accessibility standards. In this sense, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has provided the set of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), in order to ensure an equivalent user experience for people with disabilities, as well as cybersecurity has gained widespread attention in organizations in the attention of the dependence on ICT, and information management as an asset, managed by technologies and vital for decision making.

Establishing Cyberpsychology at Universities in the Area of Cyber Security.Cyberpsychology deals with the question of the extent to which people interact with technologies, such as computers, and how this can lead to different types of behavior. It also investigates the extent to which behavior and one's own identity can change, depending on the current sphere of activity - either online or offline. Therefore, Cyberpsychology can be a powerful addition to the currently technical oriented Cyber Security. In addition, an overview is provided of what other universities and colleges in and outside Europe offer in the field of cyberpsychology in terms of modules. To the end of the methodology module contents, learning outcomes and the final implementation are discussed. This includes a model with different phases like call for lecturers, preparing transcripts and presentations. Additionally, the European ECTS to hour ratio will be used to determine an appropriate number of working hours. In conclusion, the design of the branch of cyberpsychology at universities is described as future-oriented and promising, while the development at other colleges and universities is undergoing similar changes. Although not necessarily in the field of cyberpsychology, the technical courses of study, and especially computer science, are increasingly oriented towards cyber security and the like.

Repeatable Experimentation for Cybersecurity Moving Target Defense. The scientific method emphasizes that repeatable experimentation is critical for several reasons. to facilitate comparative analysis, to recreate experiments, to re-validate reported results, to critique and propose improvements, and to augment the work. In the field of cybersecurity moving target defense, where assets are shuffled to thwart attackers, it is critical to know what strategies work best, the success factors, and how these strategies may impact system performance. While some researchers make their algorithms, models, and tools available as open source, it is difficult and, in some cases, impossible to recreate studies due to the lack of the original operating environment or no support for software components used within that environment. In this paper, we present the repeatable experimentation system (RES), which aids in creating and recreating networked virtual environments to conduct comparative network studies. Experiments are composed of virtual machines, containers, automation scripts, and other artifacts that are needed to recreate and re-run a study. This includes data collection and analysis. We provide a case study where we incorporate two publicly available moving target defense implementations that use different underlying software components. We present how RES can be used for fully automated experimentation along with an analysis on the results obtained from parallel and sequential executions. We have packaged the case study into a RES file that can be used by other researchers to repeat, modify, and improve on these and other works. Cybersecurity. Dynamic defense. Moving target defense.

A Cyber Security Digital Twin for Critical Infrastructure Protection: The Intelligent Transport System Use Case.The problem of performing cybersecurity tests over existing industrial control systems is well-known. Once it is deployed, a critical system cannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attack and thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actual test outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is required for critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for new projects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach to introduce security straight from the early development phases. However, the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee the cost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is an extremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is often costly or impossible. To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific view in the system’s architectural blueprint, called the Cybersecurity Digital Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the system specifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in order to devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physical infrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodology to a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating the system security of the obtained solution.

MAKG: A Mobile Application Knowledge Graph for the Research of Cybersecurity.Large-scale datasets for mobile applications (a.k.a.app) such as AndroZoo++ and AndroVault have become powerful assets for malware detection and channel monitoring. However, these datasets focus on the scale of apps while most apps in them remain isolated and cannot easily be referenced and linked from other apps. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we present a mobile application knowledge graph, namely MAKG, which aims to collect the apps from various resources. We design a lightweight ontology of apps. It can bring a well-defined schema of collected apps so that these apps could share more linkage with each other. Moreover, we evaluate the algorithms of information extraction and knowledge alignment during the process of construction, and select the competent models to enrich the structured triples in MAKG. Finally, we list three use-cases about MAKG that are helpful to provide better services for security analysts and users. Knowledge alignment. Knowledge graph. Mobile applications 
Random flip-flop: Adding quantum randomness to digital circuits for improved cyber security, artificial intelligence and more. Harnessing quantum randomness for the generation of random numbers is an important concept crucial for information security and many other computer-related applications. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are evolving from bulky, slow, and expensive implementations towards chip-sized devices. Since computers are deterministic devices, and as such incapable of generating randomness, the prevailing modus operandi is that a QRNG is added to a computer, realizing what is known as  probabilistic Turing machine . State-of-the-art QRNGs use different hardware ports (USB, PCIe,...) and manufacturer-specific bit-transfer protocols, which limits their use by both hardware and software developers. In this work we propose an entirely different approach to use of randomness in a general digital environment (computers included), via a new, dedicated logic circuit: the random flip-flop (RFF), which is fully inter-operable with the standard logic circuits and can form an integral part of microprocessors, ultimately as an instruction-set extension. RFFs can be regarded as the missing link that closes the full set of logic elements. we show their use in digital and analog applications. We also build an RFF on a silicon chip using CMOS process. That, in principle, allows having any number of RFFs on a particular chip (e.g. microprocessor, FPGA, ASIC, ...), enabling both a very fast and massively parallel random number generation. Applications are endless, including recent trends in artificial intelligence, biomimetic stochastic computer and graphics processors. Integrated RFF does not need hardware ports nor bit-transfer protocols and allows an easy integration of randomness into higher programming languages. Logic circuits. Quantum random number generator.

Towards a framework for assessing cybersecurity risks in internet of things (IOT) devices.The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a broad class of devices used by business entities as well as consumers to provide or consume a broad array of services. All these devices share their need to connect to the internet to deliver their native functionality. This connection requirement exposes the devices to the cybersecurity threats found on the internet. Existing literature on IoT cybersecurity solution models has shown that different technologies, such as communication technologies, mobile-app based authorization framework, graph-theoretic approach or block-chain technologies, have been majorly proposed to solve IoT security issues. However, these studies only focus on some specific IoT security issues like data theft or security issues on some specific layer across the whole IoT architecture. Therefore, there is a lack of systematic framework to solve IoT cybersecurity issues. This paper presents a framework for assessing such risks.. In the qualitative analysis results, the device threats seem more severe than data confidentiality and privacy issues. This surprising finding highlight the significances of security taxonomy because both two issues are based on different technical requirements. Our study has important managerial and practical implications for users, managers and policy makers. Adoption. Cybersecurity. Internet of Things. Risk

Modeling and simulation approaches for cybersecurity impact analysis: State-of-the-art.Designing resilient critical infrastructures involves ensuring the secure operation of the underlying systems and their components. Due to the ever-increasing integration of cyber components to monitor and control physical processes in such systems, cyberattacks can not only compromise the cyberinfrastructure but can also disrupt, delay, or thwart the physical processes and operations. Thus, a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment framework mandates analyzing the potential impact that successful exploits may have on such systems. In this paper, we survey the existing literature to aggregate the diverse modeling and simulationbased approaches that have been used to define and/or characterize the impact of attacks on cyber-physical and industrial control systems. The resulting analysis provides insight into the varying definitions of impact and domains of application, providing recommendations to guide future impact analysis studies. Cyber-physical systems.

A cybersecurity data science demonstrator: Machine learning in IoT network security.The punctilious understanding of where and how Data Science creates a value-added in IoT network security lies in the applied experimental session evaluating the performance of particular machine learning models for attack detection. Results stand as a base demonstrating the benefits of the emerging technologies integration for predicting threats issues. Furthermore, implementing machine learning to intelligent security systems deepens the need for a multi-disciplinary approach and data e-infrastructure to manage the whole lifecycle (Software Engineering end-to-end, including ML and Data DevOps). Comparative performance analysis of the algorithms that have proven helpful in mitigating security in IoT domains such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forrest, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree is presenting. The case study is accomplished by conducting experiments with the public available IoT-23 dataset containing labeled information of malicious and benign IoT network traffic. The benign scenarios were obtained from original hardware and not simulated. That allowed to be analyzed real network behavior. As a result, models produce accurate outputs usable to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Besides, the lab could be multiplicate for creating business and industrial demonstrators to present the advantages of developing intrusion detection tools featuring machine learning algorithms.

Improving Cyber Security Risk Assessment by Combined Use of i∗ and Infrastructure Models.In an ever more connected and software controlled world, managing cyber security risks has become critical. Most industrial domains have grown a cyber security risk evaluation process combining its two risk factors (1) the impact on business domain assets and (2) the feasibility of threats at infrastructure level. Many available methods and tools to conduct such analysis rely on a rather bottom-up approach, anchored at the infrastructure level with only coarse grained links with the business domain. This paper explores the benefits of a more balanced approach combining a precise modelling of the business level using i∗ strategic rationale model, of the technical level using an infrastructure model and of the way the infrastructure layer supports the business layer. We show better reasoning and automation to conduct and update cyber security risks analysis. We implemented our approach on the EBIOS ISO27005 compliant methodology using the open source piStar and IriusRisk community toolset.

An Event-Based Parameter Switching Method for Controlling Cybersecurity Dynamics.This paper proposes a new event-based parameter switching method for the control tasks of cybersecurity in the context of preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics. Our parameter switching method helps avoid excessive control costs as well as guarantees the dynamics to converge as our desired speed. Meanwhile, it can be proved that this approach is Zeno-free. A new estimation method with adaptive time windows is used to bridge the gap between the probability state and the sampling state. With the new estimation method, several practical experiments are given afterwards. Cybersecurity dynamics. Event-based method. Preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics 
SARR: A Cybersecurity Metrics and Quantification Framework (Keynote). Cybersecurity Metrics and Quantification is a fundamental but notoriously hard problem and is undoubtedly one of the pillars underlying the emerging Science of Cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an novel approach to addressing this problem by unifying Security, Agility, Resilience and Risk (SARR) metrics into a single framework. The SARR approach and the resulting framework are unique because: (i) it is driven by the assumptions that are made when modeling, designing, implementing, operating, and defending systems, which are broadly defined to include infrastructures and enterprise networks. and (ii) it embraces the uncertainty inherent to the cybersecurity domain. We will review the status quo by looking into existing metrics and quantification research through the SARR lens and discuss a range of open problems. Agility. Cybersecurity management.

Development and Validation of Serious Games for Teaching Cybersecurity.Serious games have shown great potential as an instructional tool in various fields by providing improved accessibility to simulations, modeling of environments, and visualizations. However, a challenging problem in the design of serious games has been to strike a fine balance between gaming and the pedagogical elements such as content, methodology of instruction, and evaluation. Several models and frameworks have been proposed to support the serious game’s design and analysis to address the above-mentioned gap. In this paper, we present a serious game design and validation process in the context of cybersecurity education. We assess the effectiveness of a serious game as an educational tool by using a game designed to teach network firewalls and validate the game’s effectiveness to meet the learning objectives by performing a preliminary analysis consisting of objective and subjective parts. The objective analysis is performed by capturing the player’s interaction data, while the subjective analysis consists of a survey study to understand the user experience. Furthermore, we also perform an analysis of our game using the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics framework to highlight the interrelations between gaming and learning features. Our study demonstrates the significance of objective and subjective analysis, and our preliminary results on using our game to teach security have been found to be encouraging.

Supporting human-centered design in psychologically distant problem domains: The design for cybersecurity cards.Increasingly digital products and services make cybersecurity a crucial issue for designers. However, human-centered designers struggle to consider it in their work, partially a consequence of the high psychological distance between designers and cybersecurity. In this work, we build on the Design for Cybersecurity (DfC) Cards, an intervention to help designers consider cybersecurity, and examine a project-based design course to understand how and why specific DfC cards were used. Three findings result. First, designers found the intervention useful across all design phases and activities. Second, the cards helped design teams refocus their attention on the problem domain and project outcome. Third, we identify a need for support in framing and converging during user research, opportunity identification, and prototyping. We argue that the psychological distance between designers and the problem space of cybersecurity partially explains these findings, and ultimately exacerbates existing challenges in the design process. These findings suggest that design interventions must consider the psychological distance between designer and problem space, and have application in design practice across many complex problem domains.

An attandck-kg for linking cybersecurity attacks to adversary tactics and techniques?.Leveraging knowledge graph techniques to detect and analyze cyber attacks is a promising research direction at the interface between the semantic web and security research communities. In this paper, we build on prior work and develop a vocabulary to extend a cybersecurity knowledge graph with adversary tactics and techniques. Using this vocabulary, we represent rich threat intelligence instance data from MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) in a knowledge graph. This knowledge can be used to contextualize indicators of compromise from log messages, identify potential attack steps, and link them to cybersecurity knowledge. To demonstrate the benefits of the approach, we link low-level threat alerts produced by community rules to the cybersecurity knowledge graph. ATT&CK. Attack Pattern. Cybersecurity. Knowledge Graph 
Cybersecurity ontology for dynamic analysis of IT systems.Today's IT systems are characterized by a high complexity and the increasing number of sub-systems, as well as the physical equipment needed. That raises the problem of keeping the whole architecture secure, as it has been revealed in recent years by numerous scandals related to data leaks from inadequately secured systems. Several ontology-based approaches tied to the cybersecurity domain have been developed aiming at solving the problem of identifying vulnerabilities in real world systems. Unfortunately, these approaches do not address the essential problem: since real IT system architectures are dynamic and highly variable, it is necessary to enable real-time inventory and observation of all system components, as well as to retrieve up-to-date data about those systems and potential risks. The current paper has a threefold purpose. First, we examine the existing cybersecurity ontologies and identify the deficiencies that prevent us from using them in real, dynamic IT systems. Next, we introduce and propose a framework based on the Dynamic CyberSecurity Ontology, which fills the existing gaps in current solutions. Finally, we outline a monitoring system based on the developed ontology, which implements automatic data mining mechanisms that aggregate results from dynamic knowledge sources, such as Shodan or Censys. As a result, the ontological examination of systems over time becomes possible. Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity knowledge acquisition. Cybersecurity ontology. Ontology 
Cybersecurity and sustainable development.Growing interdependencies between organizations lead them towards the creation of inter-organizational networks where cybersecurity and sustainable development have become one of the most important issues. The Environmental Goods and Services Sector (EGSS) is one of the fastest developing sectors of economy fueled by the growing relationships between network entities based on the ICT usage. In this sector the Green Cybersecurity is an emerging issue because it secures processes related directly and indirectly to the environmental management and protection. In the future the multidimensional development of the EGSS can help European Union to overcome the upcoming crises. At the same time computer technologies and cybersecurity can contribute to the implementation of the concept of sustainable development. The development of environmental technologies along with their cybersecurity is one of the aims of the realization of sustainable production and domestic security concepts among the EU countries. Hence, the aim of this article is a theoretical discussion and research on the relationships between cybersecurity and sustainable development in the inter-organizational networks. Therefore, the article is an attempt to give an answer to the question about the current state of the implementation of cybersecurity in relation to the EGSS part of the economy in different EU countries.

Cybersecurity in active and healthy ageing era.The active and healthy ageing paradigm is gaining momentum as technology is turning the futuristic scenarios envisioning smart homes into reality. An ecosystem of services and devices devoted to risk prevention, prediction and early intervention will support older people in extending the time they live independently. Despite the similarities found between the field of Active and Healthy Ageing and the Internet of Things, there are two main aspects that justify a dissociated analysis. First, most of the targeted users can be somehow considered vulnerable, either because of their lack of technological literacy or because they may even suffer some kind of cognitive impairments (although this might be in a very early stage). Second, such ecosystems are thought to be deployed in one of the most private spheres of a human being, as it is the home. For this reason, special protection should be granted to the devices and services deployed in this domain. However, this contrast with the current state of the cybersecurity for Active and Healthy Ageing. There are no specific studies, standards or guidelines available to assist manufacturers and developers in their work. This does not apply to ethical or general security concerns that have been adequately addressed. In this sense, it is necessary to complement existing ethical and data privacy and security guidelines, with other aspects related to the security of IT systems for this particular application field. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a general analysis of the main issues that require special attention from a cybersecurity perspective. Active and healthy ageing. Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity for Data Science: Issues, Opportunities, and Challenges.Cybersecurity (CS) is one of the critical concerns in today’s fast-paced and interconnected world. Advancement in IoT and other computing technologies had made human life and business easy on one hand, while many security breaches are reported daily. These security breaches cost millions of dollars loss for individuals as well as organizations. Various datasets for cybersecurity are available on the Internet. There is a need to benefit from these datasets by extracting useful information from them to improve cybersecurity. The combination of data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) techniques can improve cybersecurity as machine learning techniques help extract useful information from raw data. In this paper, we have combined DS and ML for improving cybersecurity. We will use the CS dataset, and ML techniques will be applied to these datasets to identify the issues, opportunities, and cybersecurity challenges. As a contribution to research, we have provided a framework that will provide insight into ML and DS’s use for protecting cyberspace from CS attacks. Attacks. Cybersecurity. Data science. IoT.

New approach towards cyber security for nuclear power control system.Digital control system of nuclear power necessitated highest safeties, whereas this safety faces challenges of untraditionally threats from network cybersecurity, Network attacks made by monstrous human intelligence are insecure, unknowable and changeable, which are serious challenges to nuclear power safety operations. Currently the network cybersecurity solutions of the digital control system in a nuclear power plant are not well advanced as according to the requirements. Based on our technology of the virtual control system and previous work new research and development experiences, we added a new solution for network cybersecurity of digital control systems in a nuclear power plant, it run on virtual control system with the heterogeneous Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), this unique algorithm adds that if the network attacks happen, the control system can be switched to the operator manual state correctly on time. Which is the ultimate cybersecurity of the nuclear power control system and showing it' feasibility with current state of researcher. Communication system security. Cyber Security. Digital Control.

Conceptual Approach to Implementation of Adaptive Protection of Operational Cybersecurity Centers.The article approaches conceptual aspects of analyzing and modeling adaptive protection systems of operational cybersecurity centers. The conditions of global information environment are constantly changing which provides security systems an opportunity to automatically adapt to requirements of modern software. The problem of integrating a complex security system into an operational cybersecurity center and defining interaction rules between the functional components consists of several tasks. The main of them are analysis and implementation of various formalized procedures for ensuring integrated security. An adaptive integrated security system is considered as an object that either implements the ability to control and promptly build a protection model, depending on the problem being solved, or assists in preventing or eliminating an incident. The approach proposed is conditioned by two primary reasons. The first one is increasing functionality of modern technologies. The second one is strict requirements for adaptive integrated solutions that must have a scalable architecture to provide protection against a large variety of threats. The use of a complex security system within the framework of the approach proposed is expected to allow for prompt responds to incidents of both external and internal nature. Therefore, the amount of time spent on neutralization of the incident consequences will be reduced. The adaptive integrated security system, as a common platform, will provide timely monitoring, context and control capabilities in various situations. The development of such an integration platform will increase automation degree and improve the quality of information provided by information security products. Complex adaptive systems.

Deep Learning Applications on Cybersecurity.Security has always been one of the biggest challenges faced by computer systems, recent developments in the field of Machine Learning are affecting almost all aspects of computer science and Cybersecurity is no different. In this paper, we have focused on studying the possible application of deep learning techniques to three different problems faced by Cybersecurity: SPAM filtering, malware detection and adult content detection in order to showcase the benefits of applying them. We have tested a wide variety of techniques, we have applied LSTMs for spam filtering, then, we have used DNNs for malware detection and finally, CNNs in combination with Transfer Learning for adult content detection, as well as applying image augmentation techniques to improve our dataset. We have managed to reach an AUC over 0.9 on all cases, demonstrating that it is possible to build cost-effective solutions with excellent performance without complex architectures. Cybersecurity.

CySecAlert: An Alert Generation System for Cyber Security Events Using Open Source Intelligence Data.Receiving relevant information on possible cyber threats, attacks, and data breaches in a timely manner is crucial for early response. The social media platform Twitter hosts an active cyber security community. Their activities are often monitored manually by security experts, such as Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). We thus propose a Twitter-based alert generation system that issues alerts to a system operator as soon as new relevant cyber security related topics emerge. Thereby, our system allows us to monitor user accounts with significantly less workload. Our system applies a supervised classifier, based on active learning, that detects tweets containing relevant information. The results indicate that uncertainty sampling can reduce the amount of manual relevance classification effort and enhance the classifier performance substantially compared to random sampling. Our approach reduces the number of accounts and tweets that are needed for the classifier training, thus making the tool easily and rapidly adaptable to the specific context while also supporting data minimization for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Relevant tweets are clustered by a greedy stream clustering algorithm in order to identify significant events. The proposed system is able to work near real-time within the required 15-min time frameand detects up to 93.8% of relevant events with a false alert rate of 14.81%. Active learning. CERT.

CyberRel: Joint Entity and Relation Extraction for Cybersecurity Concepts.Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, while new attack techniques are emerging, causing serious harm to businesses and even countries. Therefore, how to analyze attack incidents and trace the attack groups behind them becomes extremely important. Threat intelligence provides a new technical solution for attack traceability by constructing Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG). The CKG cannot be constructed without a large number of entity-relation triples, and the existing entity and relation extraction for cybersecurity concepts uses the traditional pipeline model that suffers from error propagation and ignores the connection between the two subtasks. To solve the above problem, we propose CyberRel, a joint entity and relation extraction model for cybersecurity concepts. We model the joint extraction problem as a multiple sequence labeling problem, generating separate label sequences for different relations containing information about the involved entities and the subject and object of that relation. CyberRel introduces the latest pre-trained model BERT to generate word vectors, then uses BiGRU neural network and the attention mechanism to extract features, and finally decodes them by BiGRU combined with CRF. Experimental results on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) data show that the F1 value of CyberRel is 80.98%, which is better than the previous pipeline model. Joint model. Knowledge graph.

Scalable Learning Environments for Teaching Cybersecurity Hands-on.This Innovative Practice full paper describes a technical innovation for scalable teaching of cybersecurity hands-on classes using interactive learning environments. Hands-on experience significantly improves the practical skills of learners. However, the preparation and delivery of hands-on classes usually do not scale. Teaching even small groups of students requires a substantial effort to prepare the class environment and practical assignments. Further issues are associated with teaching large classes, providing feedback, and analyzing learning gains. We present our research effort and practical experience in designing and using learning environments that scale up hands-on cybersecurity classes. The environments support virtual networks with full-fledged operating systems and devices that emulate realworld systems. The classes are organized as simultaneous training sessions with cybersecurity assignments and learners' assessment. For big classes, with the goal of developing learners' skills and providing formative assessment, we run the environment locally, either in a computer lab or at learners' own desktops or laptops. For classes that exercise the developed skills and feature summative assessment, we use an on-premises cloud environment. Our approach is unique in supporting both types of deployment. The environment is described as code using open and standard formats, defining individual hosts and their networking, configuration of the hosts, and tasks that the students have to solve. The environment can be repeatedly created for different classes on a massive scale or for each student on-demand. Moreover, the approach enables learning analytics and educational data mining of learners' interactions with the environment. These analyses inform the instructor about the student's progress during the class and enable the learner to reflect on a finished training. Thanks to this, we can improve the student class experience and motivation for further learning. Using the presented environments KYPO Cyber Range Platform and Cyber Sandbox Creator, we delivered the classes on-site or remotely for various target groups of learners (K-12, university students, and professional learners). The learners value the realistic nature of the environments that enable exercising theoretical concepts and tools. The instructors value time-efficiency when preparing and deploying the hands-on activities. Engineering and computing educators can freely use our software, which we have released under an open-source license. We also provide detailed documentation and exemplary hands-on training to help other educators adopt our teaching innovations and enable sharing of reusable components within the community. cyber range. cybersecurity education. educational data mining. interactive learning environment. learning analytics. learning technology. sandbox. virtual machines 
Toolset for Collecting Shell Commands and Its Application in Hands-on Cybersecurity Training.This Full Paper in the Innovative Practice category presents and evaluates a technical innovation for hands-on classes. When learning cybersecurity, operating systems, or networking, students perform practical tasks using a broad range of command-line tools. Collecting and analyzing data about the command usage can reveal valuable insights into how students progress and where they make mistakes. However, few learning environments support recording and inspecting command-line inputs, and setting up an efficient infrastructure for this purpose is challenging. To aid engineering and computing educators, we share the design and implementation of an open-source toolset for logging commands that students execute on Linux machines. Compared to basic solutions, such as shell history files, the toolset's novelty and added value are threefold. First, its configuration is automated so that it can be easily used in classes on different topics. Second, it collects metadata about the command execution, such as a timestamp, hostname, and IP address. Third, all data are instantly forwarded to central storage in a unified, semi-structured format. This enables automated processing of the data, both in real-time and post hoc, to enhance the instructors' understanding of student actions. The toolset works independently of the teaching content, the training network's topology, or the number of students working in parallel. We demonstrated the toolset's value in two learning environments at four training sessions. Over two semesters, 50 students played educational cybersecurity games using a Linux command-line interface. Each training session lasted approximately two hours, during which we recorded 4439 shell commands. The semiautomated data analysis revealed different solution patterns, used tools, and misconceptions of students. Our insights from creating the toolset and applying it in teaching practice are relevant for instructors, researchers, and developers of learning environments. We provide the software and data resulting from this work so that others can use them in their hands-on classes. command-line history. cybersecurity education. educational data mining. host-based monitoring. learning analytics. learning technology. sandbox.

Four-Factor Authentication with Emerging Cybersecurity for Mobile Transactions.Cybersecurity is very much essential for Mobile Transactions to complete seamlessly. Mobile Commerce (Mcom.) is the very basic transaction type, which is very commonly used (two in five people use mobile as transaction medium). To secure this, there are various technologies used by this research. The four factors formally known as Multi-Factor-Authentication are: two of them are Traditional methods (User Login password and One Time Password (aka OTP)) with addition of Geolocation and Facial Recognition. All the data is converted to a text file, which is hidden in an image (using Babushka algorithm). The end-point then decrypts the image using the same algorithm. 4FA. Babushka. Facial recognition.

Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity: A Preliminary Study of Automated Pentesting with Offensive Artificial Intelligence.In this paper, we seek to define an experimental framework for the application of a new industrialization method for penetration testing. This work- in-progress research is placed in a particular business context: that of a company with an extensive and decentralized information system. The objective of this research is to give companies the tools to develop a penetration test task force capable of testing any system in a fully automated way and to form proper communication channel and support for risk assessment reporting. It is based on the use of artificial intelligence to make the penetration test autonomous. This research considers the conduct of penetration tests both through their technical issues and through the managerial issues specific to a decentralized information system. Cybersecurity.

A Proposal for the Classification of Methods for Verification and Validation of Safety, Cybersecurity, and Privacy of Automated Systems.As our dependence on automated systems grows, so does the need for guaranteeing their safety, cybersecurity, and privacy (SCP). Dedicated methods for verification and validation (V&V) must be used to this end and it is necessary that the methods and their characteristics can be clearly differentiated. This can be achieved via method classifications. However, we have experienced that existing classifications are not suitable to categorise V&V methods for SCP of automated systems. They do not pay enough attention to the distinguishing characteristics of this system type and of these quality concerns. As a solution, we present a new classification developed in the scope of a large-scale industry-academia project. The classification considers both the method type, e.g., testing, and the concern addressed, e.g., safety. Over 70 people have successfully used the classification on 53 methods. We argue that the classification is a more suitable means to categorise V&V methods for SCP of automated systems and that it can help other researchers and practitioners. Automated system.

UAS Cyber Security Hazards Analysis and Approach to Qualitative Assessment.In this paper, some cybersecurity vulnerabilities of modern UASs were considered. Vulnerabilities of communication, navigation, control, and surveillance equipment of modern UASs were analyzed. The cyber threats analysis and assessment algorithm were presented. The proposed algorithm is focusing on possible intruders’ portrait that can be important when qualitative risk assessment. The approach to assess the UASs cyber hazards connected with considered vulnerabilities and threats was made. It was stressed that the particular assessment highly depends on the properly defined mission, potential intruders, and even social and political situation. A short overview of the recommendations to mitigate risk connected with cyber hazards was done. Cyber hazards assessment. Cybersecurity. UAS 
A-SPICE for Cybersecurity: Analysis and Enriched Practices.The automotive industry has recently evolved to include most of its functionalities electronically controlled and has evolved to become a connected solution that can communicate with the mobile phone and the internet world. This has derived the industry attention to its linked cybersecurity and privacy risks. In June 2020, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has developed the first ever internationally harmonized and binding norms in the area of automotive cybersecurity. The new regulation that will apply to the car manufacturers, is tackling the fields of Managing vehicle cyber risks, Securing vehicles by design, Detecting and responding to security incidents across vehicle fleet and providing safe and secure software. In parallel, In February 2021, the Quality Management Centre (QMC) operating as part of the German Automotive Industry Association (VDA) has published their first draft for Automotive Spice for Cybersecurity. The new processes is targeting to evaluating the maturity of the cyber security activities that are being performed by either the vehicle manufacturers or suppliers. This paper is targeting to add some enrichment to these processes from industry and ISO21434 point of view, in order to ensure more control over the evolving cyber security threats.

Asset Driven ISO/SAE 21434 Compliant Automotive Cybersecurity Analysis with ThreatGet.With the trend towards connectivity and automation in the automotive domain, automotive cybersecurity and the protection against cyber attacks is increasingly important. This is mirrored in the upcoming regulation on cybersecurity for UNECE Type Approval. Therefore a structured and systematic approach to automotive cybersecurity risk management is needed. Risk management in general focuses on, What to protect and How could it be damaged. The combination of these allows to identify and rate existing cybersecurity risks and enables further steps of risk management. Risk management in the automotive domain will be based on an international standard that is currently developed. The draft of ISO/SAE 21434 was published in 2020 and the publication of the final version is expected in 2021. This standard does not describe a strict risk management approach but rather defines a framework of activities which need to be conducted, without specifying a process or methods. It is therefore important to investigate existing approaches, consider the guidance in standards and regulation and apply and evaluate resulting processes and methods. We report here experiences collected during the application of an asset driven automotive cybersecurity analysis with the Tool ThreatGet which is compliant with ISO/SAE 21434. The considered use cases for this application is a gateway and communication ECU developed by TTControl. Automotive security. Gateway and communication ECU. ISO/SAE 21434 
Nicolas Cage is the Center of the Cybersecurity Universe.Nicolas Cage, prolific actor, Oscar winner but also master of ham acting, star of many excellent films and of at least as many really bad ones. A conspicuous number of these films directly revolve around cybersecurity or can be used to explain cybersecurity notions in such a way that they can be understood by non-experts. This paper is part of a research program that I have been carrying out on how to use films and other artworks to explain cybersecurity notions, and thus provide a form of cybesecurity show and tell (in which telling, i.e., explaining notions in a formal, technical way, can be paired with showing through visual storytelling or other forms of storytelling). Here, I focus on 15 of Cage’s films in which he has played a wide variety of roles: a stunt motorcyclist, a paroled ex-con and former U.S. Ranger, a U.S. Marine in World War II, an agent of an authoritarian agency, a retired master car thief, a criminal mastermind, an illegal arms dealer, a master sorcerer, a treasure hunter historian, a Batman-like superhero, Spider-Man Noir, Superman, an NSA employee, and a hacker star-nosed mole.
Automotive Cybersecurity - Training the Future.The automotive domain is moving towards connected and automated vehicles [13] with a high degree of dynamic and adaptive behaviour, driven by software.

First Experiences with the Automotive SPICE for Cybersecurity Assessment Model.The Automotive SPICE for Cybersecurity Assessment Model has been published as a first version in February 2021. It will be used for cybersecurity homologation assessments of projects. A new UNECE norm requires from summer 2022 onwards the presence of a CSMS (Cybersecurity Management System) for organisations and the VDA AK13 published in Feb 2021 a new assessment model for the cybersecurity of Automotive development projects. The SOQRATES group as a working party of Automotive suppliers and research and training bodies has developed a cybersecurity engineer job role and training and best practice examples of how to cover the new security engineering practices. Also, first trials of using the new security related questions have been done and first experiences are shared in this paper. Automotive SPICE for cybersecurity. Cybersecurity assessment.

Impact of the New A-SPICE Appendix for Cybersecurity on the Implementation of ISO26262 for Functional Safety.In the world of automotive industry, the usage of network communications and cloud services is an unavoidable need, which jeopardizes the vehicle systems to cyber-attacks, causing loss of money, vital information, or may be safety hazards. Hence, just as safety became a critical part of the development in the late 20th century, the automotive domain started to consider cyber-security as an integral part of the development of modern vehicles, which led the VDA to release the new A-SPICE appendix for Cybersecurity. For years, the co-design of automotive solutions depended on the integration of ISO26262 standard for Functional Safety with the SAE J3061 cybersecurity-guide-book SAE [International, a global standards development organization and professional association of engineers and technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries]. In this paper, a demonstration will be presented through a case study performed with a certain methodology to illustrate the impact of the new Automotive SPICE standard for Cybersecurity on the implementation of ISO26262 standard for Functional Safety.

The Cybersecurity Extension for ASPICE - A View from ASPICE Assessors.ASPICE has been introduced to development of embedded systems at automotive suppliers to assess the capability of processes. ASPICE covers processes for software, system, quality assurance, configuration management, problem resolution, change management, project management and supplier monitoring. It defines a scheme for determining the capability of the process based on the underlying PAM. HW Spice is also taken into consideration, because it is also necessary for Cybersecurity, but not mechanical Spice. Based on ASPICE VDA defined processes for Cybersecurity Engineering, Cybersecurity Risk Management and Supplier Request and Selection. This means additional effort for the assessors and also the engineering team when the ASPICE assessment is extended by processes of Cybersecurity to satisfy the requirements of standard ISO/SAE 21434. This paper investigates for the method of mapping the base practices (BP) of cybersecurity process defined by VDA to BP of ASPICE process(es) to reduce the time of an assessment by merging the Base Practices of Processes from Cybersecurity with the Base Practices of Processes from ASPICE.

Punish and perish: The human factor in cybersecurity. According to many prominent experts, IT users are the weakest link in cyber-security chain. This assumption has important consequences on the definition of cyber-security policies which are often rooted in the fear of sanctions. We argue in this paper that such policies miss the point of security because they create wrong incentives for users who make mistakes or undergo the maneuvers of social engineers. Doing so, most cyber-security policies are in fact scapegoat processes more that effective guidelines for fighting cyber attacks. We argue that alternative cyber security policies, breaking up with the  Weakest Link  paradigm, are required in order to make significant improvements in facing cyber threats, especially in times of COVID-19.

OT cyber security frameworks comparison tool (CSFCTool).This paper proposes a holistic cybersecurity online tool to support implementation activities of the National Framework for Cybersecurity & Data Protection, one of its contextualizations, as well as the fifteen Essential Cybersecurity Controls. It also aims at promoting its wide dissemination by SMEs. All the regulations, standards and national/international laws mentioned as Informative References for each Subcategory in the Framework Core are, in fact, made available through a web application where they can be consulted with a few clicks, guiding even less experienced users in the creation of their cybersecurity compliance projects. The research and analysis activities conducted with a systematic, global and conceptual approach - consistent with the original document - have been aimed at highlighting the substantial differences between IT/OT cybersecurity requirements in order to increase, through a comparative analysis, the cyber resilience of national critical infrastructures. Meanwhile, since an important step towards cyberspace security is a global increase in the level of cyber risk awareness, the tool aims to be used for education and training programs too, both at the corporate and academic levels, in order to bridge the skills gap in the job market between job seekers and employers. For this purpose, some of the main reference standards used for auditing, vulnerability assessment and risk management activities have been included. Critical infrastructures security.

Cybersecurity impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy.The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed companies to the extensive use of digital services, to implement home working and provide online services to people in lockdown. As a consequence, it is interesting to study how this has affected the number, kind and distribution of cybersecurity attacks. This paper gives an empirical evaluation of the cybersecurity attacks at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, based on data collected from the questionnaires of the annual Digital Attacks Observatory. It shows that the overall number of attacks has not increased, but attacks have affected smaller companies than before. This can be explained with the fact that the Italian industrial scenario is mostly populated by small and medium enterprises, that have been obliged to a quick reconversion of their IT systems and typically lack the necessary cybersecurity culture.

Critical information infrastructure protection: Between cybersecurity and policymaking.The concept of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) is intrinsically interdisciplinary, as it depends on the development of informed estimates of potential threats, the individuation of appropriate responses and preventative measures and finally the proposal, application, and execution of relevant strategies. This poses the challenge of managing a field where regulation and cybersecurity collide, as the critical nature of the goods and services depending on CII's correct and uninterrupted functioning force policymakers to intervene in an environment shaped by the issues and assumptions typical of cyberspace. In espousing this view, this paper seeks to explore the challenges arising from the intersection of these two perspectives, focusing first on a broad overview of CIIP's links with policymaking and cybersecurity and then mapping the reciprocal influence CII and selected geopolitical elements exert on each other at an international level.

Enhancing cyber security in the Philippine academe: A risk-based it project assessment approach.Cybersecurity devices such as anti-virus, intrusion detection, and prevention system, firewall, network access control, are reactive responses to cyber-attacks because it is based on the known signature. However, security analytics and security information, and event manager are devices, that can gather data about the historical behavior of attacks and correlate it to one another. The significance of this research is to precisely predict if an attack were about to happen, many industries only act if an attack was already happening inside their network or has done significant damages already to the business. This research would significantly help industries, to gain insights on the security events on their network. Artificial Intelligence can instantly predict and suggest if a person can potentially harm based on people's record of good behavior. This can be related to a computer’s normal pattern of behavior in the network and once an anomaly happens an unusual behavior can be detected. Hence, the best application of Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security is to put out a fire before it spread out, preventing data breaches that can cause damages to people's lives and material assets.

The Marriage Between Safety and Cybersecurity: Still Practicing.Emerging technologies, like self-driving cars, drones, and the Internet-of-Things must not impose threats to people, neither due to accidental failures (safety), nor due to malicious attacks (security). As historically separated fields, safety and security are often analyzed in isolation. They are, however, heavily intertwined: measures that increase safety often decrease security and vice versa. Also, security vulnerabilities often cause safety hazards, e.g. in autonomous cars. Therefore, for effective decision-making, safety and security must be considered in combination. This paper discusses three major challenges that a successful integration of safety and security faces: (1) The complex interaction between safety and security (2) The lack of efficient algorithms to compute system-level risk metrics (3) The lack of proper risk quantification methods. We will point out several research directions to tackle these challenges, exploiting novel combinations of mathematical game theory, stochastic model checking, as well as the Bayesian, fuzzy, and Dempster-Schafer frameworks for uncertainty reasoning. Finally, we report on early results in these directions. Attack trees. Fault tree-attack tree integration. Fault trees. Interaction. Model-based. Safety. Security 
Cyber-Security in Digital Metering Value Chain for Mountain Landslide Warning.The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) are initiating a digitalization process that involves the use of a digital metering value chain and cloud computing. The main objective of this study is to investigate how NVE can ensure cyber-security in digital meters and the cloubased metering value chain for mountain landslide warning. The study is based on a qualitative approach including methods like document analysis and semi structured interviews used as input to a risk analysis based on the ISO 31000 standard. The risk analysis covered three different scenarios from NVE. Those three scenarios were internal, external Norwegian, and transnational value chains for metering landslide warning. The results of the risk analysis showed that the largest risk was loss of metering data caused by failures in complex digital value chains combined with the risk of human error. We concluded that the risk is significantly higher for the transnational digital value chains, and that the recommended risk mitigation is a combination of organizational and technical countermeasures.

A Review on Cybersecurity of Internet of Things.Internet of things (IOT) is the fastest growing technology in today’s world and has changed the world completely. It has become an integral part of our lives and from smart home to smart cities everything is connected to the internet which has reduced the human effort and made our lives easier. As it is all about the internet, so with it comes some repercussion which are the cyber threats. These threats need to be dealt with in a proper and a phased manner so that it won’t lead to any device failure or data breaches. As there have been a lot of attacks in the past so the issue of cybersecurity in IOT is of huge importance and needs to get much more attention. This paper discusses about the ways in which the important sectors like smart cities, healthcare and industries, apply IOT on day-to-day basis and the different ways in which these sectors deal with the cybersecurity issues. This paper deeply analyses the various kinds of cyber threats as well as the consequences the system has to face because of these attacks and what preventive measures can be taken to avoid the attacks.

Adapted SANS cybersecurity policies for nist cybersecurity framework.Cybersecurity Framework has been developed by NIST as a framework for improving cybersecurity in critical infrastructures, but soon it has been found out that it is applicable for any organizational type. The Framework Core defines a set of five activities (functions) for cybersecurity achievements. The functions are subdivided into categories and the last ones in subcategories. Finally, informative references are supplied as examples of applicable standards and specifications. The framework can be used to plan cybersecurity activities in the organization: Current Profile of the organization has to be developed and then Target Profile as a plan to achieve a particular cybersecurity level. The problem with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework adoption in non-English speaking countries like Bulgaria is the informative references. They are in English and are appropriate for staff with technical background. On the other hand, plans (Target Profile) have to be approved by the senior management – it must be in Bulgarian. Therefore. Another problem with NIST Cybersecurity Framework adoption is that only a few standards and specifications can be used as informative references in Bulgaria. These are mainly international standards, specifications, and EU directives. SANS offers a set of template policies organized around the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. These policies refer to a minimal set of informative references. In such a way, the policies can be translated into Bulgarian for the senior management and the informative references can remain in English for the technical staff.

Supplier cybersecurity risk assessment methodology. Supplier cybersecurity risk has increased significantly with the galloping introduction of new mobility trends in vehicle technologies and the emergence of fast to market providers of electrical components hardware. The risk for OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) is compounded based on the tiered structure of the automotive supply chain. The global nature of the supply chain additionally exacerbates the issue due to local state policies and requirements. Lack of common standards further elevates the risk level. The demand for supplier risk assessment springs from the automotive manufacturers mission to provide safe and secure transportation. Their responsibility in safeguarding personal data and human lives is the utmost driver behind making supplier decisions. The demand lies in the fundamental cybersecurity industry asks for a reliable tool to assess risk level and make well-grounded business decisions. The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology for assessing third party cybersecurity risk on a component, sub-system, system, and enterprise levels. This methodology will deliver the following improvements: assess status with a live, reconfigurable model. provide the dollar amount for a particular risk level. feed into common requirements and set future product requirements. define company policies. -develop risk mitigation strategies. generate synergies between connected vehicle ecosystems and smart cities, and provide flexibility for a modular approach with interdependencies between modules.

Assessing Small Institutions’ Cyber Security Awareness Using Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q).For large financial institutions, the available resources allocated to cyber security greatly exceed the capabilities of smaller financial institutions, such as credit unions and community banks. However, the sensitivity of personally identifiable information (PII) and associated risks to the institutions and respective consumers in the event of security breaches are the same no matter the size of the financial institution. These facts when assessed in tandem yield a false equivalency: how can a smaller institution with significantly fewer resources keep consumer and company data secure at standards equivalent to large financial institutions? In this research, Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaires (HAIS-Q) are voluntarily completed by six employees of a small financial institution and 25 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in computing courses at a small four year collegiate institution and are quantitatively analyzed/discussed to evaluate potential relationships between employee knowledge, attitude, and behavior (KAB model).

Locating the Perpetrator: Industry Perspectives of Cellebrite Education and Roles of GIS Data in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics.Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data is incorporated into cybersecurity and digital forensics at many levels from the development of secure code, to the metadata stored by systems and employed during civil and criminal cases. This paper reports on the role of GIS Data in the development of both systems and the development of legal probable cause. Specifically, we report on how GIS data is incorporated into three advanced courses: Wireless Security, Secure Software Development, and Forensic Investigation of Wireless Network and Mobile Devices. GIS data needs to be accurate for many reasons including probable cause. We report on IRB-approved student surveys about their experience in the three courses. We find that overall students liked the courses and offered insights into future course improvements. Crime. Forensic Investigation of Wireless Network and Mobile Devices.

Building a knowledge representation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities using natural language processing.The rising amount of cybersecurity incidents puts our systems at risk. Cybersecurity experts can hardly keep up with the quantity of information they are confronted with. Consequently, joint approaches, referred to as threat intelligence have been developed to gather historic information and increase our systems resilience. However, not all the information presented is directly usable and requires manual interaction. To stay up to date with current developments in the threat landscape, it is essential to consider automation. Therefore, we propose a hybrid method capable of extracting relevant information from structured formats, as well as unstructured text and apply Natural Language Processing to entries of the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Moreover, we discuss an ontology capable of representing the extracted data as a knowledge base. The ontology helps to performs a set of queries as well as logical and inference operations for in-depth cyber risk analysis. Cybersecurity. Natural language processing. Ontology.

MTLAT: A Multi-Task Learning Framework Based on Adversarial Training for Chinese Cybersecurity NER.With the continuous development of cybersecurity texts, the importance of Chinese cybersecurity named entity recognition (NER) is increasing. However, Chinese cybersecurity texts contain not only a large number of professional security domain entities but also many English person and organization entities, as well as a large number of Chinese-English mixed entities. Chinese Cybersecurity NER is a domain-specific task, current models rarely focus on the cybersecurity domain and cannot extract these entities well. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multi-Task Learning framework based on Adversarial Training (MTLAT) to improve the performance of Chinese cybersecurity NER. Extensive experimental results show that our model, which does not use any external resources except static word embedding, outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the Chinese cybersecurity dataset. Moreover, our model outperforms the BiLSTM-CRF method on Weibo, Resume, and MSRA Chinese general NER datasets by 4.1%, 1.04%, 1.79% F1 scores, which proves the universality of our model in different domains.

Compositional Sonification of Cybersecurity Data in a Baroque Style.Compositional sonification is a musical mapping algorithm that transforms a dataset into a soundscape for humans to hear numbers within a musical structure. In this study, we used three methods to sonify data: 1) a Baroque-style gestural mapping algorithm that emphasized timing and rhythm using an analog method of handwritten composition, 2) an electronic online pitch sequencer, and 3) the classical instrument Harp performing notated music. We investigated related sound mapping algorithms and the sensitivity of pattern representation of cybersecurity data, including the malware distribution network datasets. Our preliminary experiments showed that a Baroque-inspired timing element based on gestures plays a critical role in aural sonification. Using a sequencer with visualizers helped listeners grasp the patterns more effectively since they were able to watch and hear the results simultaneously. Performing the sonified data live on the harp helped make the compositions more relatable and thus connected with a broader audience. The harp also added a visual element which helped listeners identify patterns. We found that listeners were able to accurately identify the sonified data patterns in both the baroque-style analog handwritten compositions performed on harp and the compositions produced by the Online Sequencer. While non-musicians were able to answer questions about the data patterns they heard with a high percentage of accuracy, their results improved when visual elements were added. AI. Augmented reality.

Evaluation Strategies for Cybersecurity Training Methods: A Literature Review.The human aspect of cybersecurity continues to present challenges to researchers and practitioners worldwide. While measures are being taken to improve the situation, a vast majority of security incidents can be attributed to user behavior. Security and Awareness Training (SAT) has been available for several decades and is commonly given as a suggestion for improving the cybersecurity behavior of end-users. However, attackers continue to exploit the human factor suggesting that current SAT methods are not enough. Researchers argue that providing knowledge alone is not enough, and some researchers suggest that many currently used SAT methods are, in fact, not empirically evaluated. This paper aims to examine how SAT has been evaluated in recent research using a structured literature review. The result is an overview of evaluation methods which describes what results that can be obtained using them. The study further suggests that SAT methods should be evaluated using a variety of methods since different methods will inevitably provide different results. The presented results can be used as a guide for future research projects seeking to develop or evaluate methods for SAT. Awareness. Evaluation. Methods. Security. Training. User 
The Development of a Multidisciplinary Cybersecurity Workforce: An Investigation.The unexpected digital transformation that was forced due to COVID-19 found many citizens and organizations unprepared to deal with the relevant technological advances and the cyber threat landscape. This outcome highlighted once more the cybersecurity skills shortage and the necessity to address this gap. A solution to this, is to consider a multidisciplinary cybersecurity workforce with professionals originating from different backgrounds, beyond the traditional ones such as computing and IT. To be able to engage people though, they need to be aware of the possibilities that exist in cybersecurity for those that originate from non-traditional disciplines. Moreover, cybersecurity professionals need to be aware of the added value when collaborating with these professionals. These are aspects that need to be extensively investigated to provide insights to academia and industry, to develop education and training curricula towards building a multidisciplinary cybersecurity workforce. This paper investigated these aspects in a Further Education and Higher Education College in the UK, where 88 students from 5 disciplines were surveyed, providing valuable observations as to the interest of students, and future professionals, to work in cybersecurity industry and their perception on the subject disciplines relevant to cybersecurity jobs.

A Wolf, Hyena, and Fox Game to Raise Cybersecurity Awareness Among Pre-school Children.Currently, children have a greater exposure to cyberspace and cyber threats than any previous generation. Digital technologies are evolving continuously with the result that cell phones, tablets and similar devices are more accessible to both young and old. Technological advancements create many opportunities, however it also exposes its users to many threats. Pre-school children are especially vulnerable to these threats, as they are rarely made aware of, or empowered to defend themselves against these threats. An approach to solving this problem is to create a mobile serious game that promotes cybersecurity awareness among pre-school children. The focus of this paper is the part of the game that promotes the use of strong passwords and not sharing these passwords with one’s friends. Online safety for pre-school children.

Cyber Security in Healthcare Organisations.The aim of the research described in this paper was to develop a cyber security survey for the purpose of assessing the state of cyber security controls in a selection of healthcare organisations in South Australia. To achieve this aim, a gap analysis was conducted, using the collected data, that identified cyber security controls which had not been implemented satisfactorily, according to management. An acceptable level of cyber security is dependent on a specific set of controls that should have been implemented in order to maintain the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of digital healthcare data and the risk appetite of the organisations. Specifically, in this case, healthcare management was concerned about the increasing number of cyber threats to Patient Health Information (PHI). In this era of a connected world, information is highly sought after and vulnerable to cyber security breaches. In this context, cyber security can be seen to be very similar to personal hygiene, such that, personal hygiene is only achieved if the appropriate practices, routines, actions, and behaviours are in place.

A Reference Point for Designing a Cybersecurity Curriculum for Universities.The objective of this study is to propose a cybersecurity curriculum from a best practice perspective for universities and other higher educational institutions. Cybersecurity is a fast-growing part of the overall job market and cybersecurity skills shortage is a factor that needs attention worldwide. An updated approach is needed to build the cybersecurity labour force. A scoping literature review was applied on academic databases for proposed cybersecurity skills curricula. It was also applied on cybersecurity curricula offered by top universities as well as by studying cybersecurity curriculum frameworks and guidelines. The knowledge, skills, abilities and modules from the aforementioned were integrated to compile a holistic reference point for a cybersecurity curriculum. The study found that there is a global need for cybersecurity degrees and specifically for African countries like South African. More cybersecurity professionals need to be trained in the necessary technical abilities, combined by the necessary soft skills to be productive and fill the gaps in industry. This is possible by concentrating on this study’s proposal namely a reference point for cybersecurity modules to be included in a cybersecurity curriculum. Curriculum. Cybersecurity. Education.

Analysis of the Application of Steganography Applied in the Field of Cybersecurity. The image files have data areas that are not very important for the visualization of the corresponding image and, if these areas are changed or altered, the image does not have a perceptible visual change, therefore they can be used to hide information, having almost certainty that the image has not been altered. The least significant bit (LSB) method consists in replacing the last bit of each byte and can do it in several bytes at the same time and the image will not have a noticeable change. Each substituted bit is part of a letter of the message that you want to hide in the given image. In general, images with PGM extension are very useful to apply the technique (LSB) since they are images whose content is given without following some algorithm of compression. This means that the content of the file is more readable and easy to work since it is in the ascci format (US standard code for information exchange). The content of an image with PGM extension, can be visualized using a simple text editor, so that the ASCII information can be seen as a representation of whole numbers, the value of these numbers will represent the intensity of color, 255 is white and 0 is black. If each row of the matrix represents an image data and every last digit, which is the least significant bit, is altered, then the eight bits corresponding to each altered byte would represent a letter belonging to a hidden message word. If this sequence is repeated several times you can hide more information such as phrases or sentences. Steganography is a useful tool in the field of computer security where it is required to verify that private information is correctly used by the user determined using the encryption in the personal key. There are already several software products that are responsible for carrying out this process, one of these cases is OpenStego, which encrypts the information using steganography and through passwords ensures that only the bearer of it will be able to visualize said information. We will show that the use of the Fortran, MatLab programming language presents great advantages for steganography since access to memory spaces through pointers allows freeing up memory at runtime, which provides a high degree of efficiency in the execution of a Program. Fortran, being a programming language oriented to mathematical calculation in general, has tools that facilitate its application and expressly the matrix calculation used in steganography.

Cybersecurity and Digital Exclusion of Seniors: What Do They Fear?.The rapid development of digitalization has led to a more or less endless variety of ways for individuals to communicate and interact with the outside world. However, in order to take advantage of all the benefits of digitalization, individuals need to have the necessary skills. Seniors represent a group that, compared to other groups, lives in a digital exclusion to an excessive extent, mainly due to the fact that they lack the necessary knowledge to use digital technology and digital services. Based on empirical data collected from seniors partaking in digital training, we have analyzed their perceptions of why they and other seniors are digitally excluded. Our findings point out that a major barrier for seniors to be more digitally included is different variants of fear of using digital technology and digital services. The common denominator can be traced down the possibilities to be exposed to frauds, scams, viruses, and faulty handling, which in turn cause undesired consequences. Consequently, we propose a research agenda where digital training and digital inclusion measurements should be studied side by side with cybersecurity behavior. Thus, making cybersecurity a fundamental part of digital inclusion has the potential to minimize the fears identified in this research as inhibitors to technology adoption. Cybersecurity. Digital divide. Digital exclusion. Fear 
SherLOCKED: A Detective-Themed Serious Game for Cyber Security Education.Gamification and Serious Games are progressively being used over a host of fields, particularly to support education. Such games provide a new way to engage students with content and can complement more traditional approaches to learning. This article proposes SherLOCKED, a new serious game created in the style of a 2D top-down puzzle adventure. The game is situated in the context of an undergraduate cyber security course, and is used to consolidate students’ knowledge of foundational security concepts (e.g. the CIA triad, security threats and attacks and risk management). SherLOCKED was built based on a review of existing serious games and a study of common gamification principles. It was subsequently implemented within an undergraduate course, and evaluated with 112 students. We found the game to be an effective, attractive and fun solution for allowing further engagement with content that students were introduced to during lectures. This research lends additional evidence to the use of serious games in supporting learning about cyber security. COVID-19. Cyber security. Detective. Education. Emergency online learning.

Human Individual Difference Predictors in Cyber-Security: Exploring an Alternative Scale Method and Data Resolution to Modelling Cyber Secure Behavior.With the increase in reliance upon technology in our everyday lives, users are more vulnerable than ever to cybercrime and data security breaches. Whilst it is important, and valued, to develop technology-based interventions to mitigate this risk, it is also important to consider the impact of human error on cyber safety, and how this can be measured. Data collected from a diverse sample of 189 participants using an alternative measurement scale to more traditional Likert scales, the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), was adopted for previously researched measures of individual differences (age, gender, education level, personality, decision-making style, risk-taking preferences, acceptance of the internet, and related Theory of Planned Behavior and Protection-Motivation Theory concepts) to expand understanding of the relationships between individual differences and user-end cybersecurity behaviors, and explore the significance of this alternative measure in the field of Cyber Psychology. Findings demonstrate the use of VAS can be a reliable and valid method capable of identifying a variety of potential human vulnerabilities and strengths on an individual level. These findings highlight the importance of considering a human-centered approach to cyber-security, and future research should consider then importance of these individual differences in tailoring practical interventions.

At the same time, different cybersecurity competitions are being organized to identify leading countries in cybersecurity domains. One such competition is European Cyber Security Challenge in which countries across Europe participate annually to showcase their cyber capabilities. In this research, we present a first of a kind study that focused on identifying selection and training strategies of national cybersecurity teams for international cybersecurity competitions. In the study, we identified countries with major talent pools, their selection and training methodologies, and the training platforms they used. Cyber security. Education. Team building. Training 
Understanding the Last Line of Defense: Human Response to Cybersecurity Events. Cybersecurity in consumer, corporate, and military settings, continues to be a growing concern in the modern and technologically driven world. As Wiederhold (2014) puts it, the human factor remains the security’s weakest link in cyberspace. A literature review related to human response to cybersecurity events reveals three phases involved in the cybersecurity response process, including: (1) Susceptibility, the phase preceding an event, which primarily encompasses behaviors that impact vulnerability to a cybersecurity event. (2) Detection of the event when it occurs. and (3) Response to the event after it occurs. In order for an individual to effectively protect themselves and their organizations from cybersecurity breaches, they must understand and be sensitive to the susceptibility of their devices, and when a potential breach occurs, must exhibit rapid and effective response. The goal of this effort was to examine the human factors surrounding non-expert response to a cybersecurity vulnerability or event and create a framework based on the literature. Recommendations for what steps can be taken to better prepare individuals to respond to cyber events is provided. Cybersecurity. Decision making. Human factors. Information security.

Study on the Impact of Learning About Information Security Measures on Mental Models: Applying Cybersecurity Frameworks to Self-learning Materials.The shortage of information-security workers is a problem. Appropriate mental models are considered important to encourage learners to appropriately plan, understand, and act on security measures. We aim to create materials to help security staff members acquire the right mental model in their learning and improve the learning effect. To create such materials, it is important to investigate the current mental model of the staff, how the model changes through learning, and its impact on the learning efficiency. A preliminary experiment was conducted on individuals who had not received such education and individuals who had participated in security-related work for a few to several years. The participants self-studied both standard and revised materials on information security measures, and we conducted tests and semi-structured interviews to examine the changes in their performance and confidence as well as the changes to their mental models before and after self-learning. Four mental models were identified during the experiment: role-based, timeline/phase-based, framework-based, and unstructured models. After learning, for those with security-related work experience, we identified examples of changing to a framework-based model, and for groups with no security education, we identified examples of acquiring a role-based model. Instances when the model did not change were also noted. The test scores and degree of confidence of both groups improved after the self-learning, and a significant difference was shown for questions regarding which security measures contribute to which security function based on a small sample size .

Beyond Murphy’s Law: Applying Wider Human Factors Behavioural Science Approaches in Cyber-Security Resilience: An Applied Practice Case Study Discussing Approaches to Assessing Human Factors Vulnerabilities in Cyber-Security Systems. Traditional approaches to cyber-security resilience, assuring the overall socio-technical system is secure from immediate known attacks and routes to potential future attacks, have relied on three pillars of people, process, and technology. In any complex socio-technical system, human behaviour can disrupt the secure and efficient running of the system with risk accumulating through individual and system-wide errors and compromised security behaviours that may be exploited by actors with malicious intent. Practitioners’ experience and use of different assessment methods and approaches to establish cyber-security vulnerabilities and risk are evaluated. Qualitative and quantitative methods and data are used for different stages of investigations in order to derive risk assessments and access contextual experience for further analyses. Organisational security culture and development approaches along with safety assessment methods are discussed in this case study to understand how well the people, the system, and the organisation interact. Cyber-security Human Factors practice draws on other application areas such as safety, usability, behaviours and culture to progressively assess security posture. the benefits of each approach are discussed. This study identifies the most effective methods for vulnerability identification and risk assessment, with focus on modelling large, dynamic and complex socio-technical systems, to be those which identify cultural factors with impact on human-system interactions.

Disadvantaged by Disability: Examining the Accessibility of Cyber Security.Today, we are living in a digitally dependent world. Through the use of digital technologies, life is meant to be easier and streamlined. This includes giving access to services that previously were unavailable to many due to disability. Although technology has evolved immensely over the past few decades, reducing the digital divide, authentication methods have changed very little. Authentication is the forefront of securing users’ information, services and technology, yet for many it still poses issues in terms of usability and security, due to specific characteristics of different disabilities. In this paper, drawing upon a literature review, a review of recognized disabilities, and the results of a small questionnaire study, we review the current authentication methods and discuss the potential issues that users with different disabilities face when interacting with these methods. We identify the specific aspects of disabilities that lead users to struggle to authenticate themselves. The results of this study lead to several recommendations, and suggestions for extending the existing inclusive technology framework to the authentication context. Through extending the framework, this could guide the development of future technologies, systems and services, ensuring that they are not only digitally inclusive in their function, but digitally inclusive in their security.

Digital Human in Cybersecurity Risk Assessment.Cybersecurity focuses on technological solutions, skills, and setup. Nevertheless, advanced cyber attacks include aspects of social engineering and exploit the weaknesses of an individual. Advanced persistent threat actors are invisible. Therefore, after harvesting large amounts of publicly available data, they have overabundant time to stage a possible attack and choose a victim as the weakest link. On social media, people tend to disclose personal information in implicit and explicit ways. User profiles and What is on your mind messages on the social network can contain sensitive and private data, e.g. location, address, and birth date. However, user comments, Likes, and shared photos can determine the user’s personality during a personality trait analysis. Habits, interests, locations, and exposed loved ones are vulnerabilities that can be exploited during the cyber attack. Comprehensive image analysis, application of state of the art recognition techniques could be used to analyse shared photos of the individual, assume specific weaknesses, and predict behaviour-related features. The work aims to build a formal ontology-based model for cybersecurity risk assessment that considers digital human characteristics. A multi-layered architecture solution was build as a proof of concept to maintain a set of artificial intelligence algorithms and specially developed questionnaires for data gathering and processing. The prototype enabled us to organise a small scale experiment to validate trait analysis methods. Also, it opened further research directions. Artificial intelligence. Cybersecurity. Digital human.

Improving the Cyber Security by Applying the Maturity Model Case: Electricity Industry of Iran.Continuity and reliability of electricity supply in a country are vital to the operational continuity of the critical infrastructure and government. High levels of cyber security are required to achieve such key measures in the electricity industry. We propose solutions and models on how to improve the cyber security using the maturity model in order to achieve continuity of electricity supplies. Maturity levels start from the relative level (level 1) and continue to the adaptive level (level 4). A total of 10 domains are defined in the model. The practices of cyber security are clustered into domains. The model is used for assessment of the strength and weakness factors for the organizations from the model. The case to demonstrate the concepts is from Iran. Cyber security. Electricity industry. Iran. Maturity model. Operational continuity 
It’s Not My Problem: How Healthcare Models Relate to SME Cybersecurity Awareness.Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) make up a significant part of European economies. Despite their economic importance, they are often described as poorly placed to deal with cyber risks because of resource constraints or commercial interests. Providing appropriate tooling would facilitate a greater appreciation of the risks and provide mitigation strategies. In a series of workshops demonstrating visualization tools for cybersecurity, constructs from healthcare models such as awareness, self-efficacy, and a willingness to engage were investigated to throw light on the likelihood that the technologies would be adopted. Although most constructs were validated, it turns out that self-efficacy could more appropriately be interpreted as a desire to understand a broader company narrative rather than empowering any individual to identify and manage cyber risk. As part of an ongoing examination of technology acceptance, this work provides further evidence that technology must be contextualised to make sense for the individual as part of the SME rather than as individual employee.

Human Characteristics and Genomic Factors as Behavioural Aspects for Cybersecurity.Modern behavioural genetic studies of personality investigate the genetic and environmental contribution to the development of personality and the genetic and environmental covariance with a range of characteristics, as well as stress, impulsiveness, and addiction. Cyber kill chains are used to define stages of the incident and to position an event. The risky behaviour, possible human addictions, and weaknesses are used in the evaluation, selecting the best human-to-human or human-machine-human interactions strategy. An unintentional human error can cause cybersecurity breaches, because stress, long working hours, and set of wide-range responsibilities lower caution and increase the impact of individual characteristics on the decision rationality. This work aims to hypothesise a possible holistic architecture for specific human behaviour factors involved in cybersecurity risks. A good cybersecurity habit could prevent incidents and protect against attacks. Habits are mostly initiated automatically. Therefore, they can dominate personal behavioural patterns under specific circumstances. Genetic heritability of impulsiveness is considered as moderate from 33% to 50%. Genomic data study of particular individuals can help identify one’s behaviour patterns and show the risks in cybersecurity for that individual. An individual risk profile could be generated by combining known genome variants linked to a trait of particular behaviour analysing molecular pathways of Dopamin, Serotonin, Catecholaminergic, GABAergic, neurons migration, Opioid, cannabinoid system and other addiction genes. Construction of a model strategy when including genomic information results for the specification of human behavioural characteristics might benefit towards higher risk assessment in cybersecurity processes.

Electronic Voting Technology Inspired Interactive Teaching and Learning Pedagogy and Curriculum Development for Cybersecurity Education.Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important to individuals and society alike. However, due to its theoretical and practical complexity, keeping students interested in the foundations of cybersecurity is a challenge. One way to excite such interest is to tie it to current events, for example elections. Elections are important to both individuals and society, and typically dominate much of the news before and during the election. We are developing a curriculum based on elections and, in particular, an electronic voting protocol. Basing the curriculum on an electronic voting framework allows one to teach critical cybersecurity concepts such as authentication, privacy, secrecy, access control, encryption, and the role of non-technical factors such as policies and laws in cybersecurity, which must include societal and human factors. Student-centered interactions and projects allow them to apply the concepts, thereby reinforcing their learning. Curricula. Electronic voting. Interactive teaching and learning 
Minimizing Cognitive Overload in Cybersecurity Learning Materials: An Experimental Study Using Eye-Tracking. Cybersecurity education is critical in addressing the global cyber crisis. However, cybersecurity is inherently complex and teaching cyber can lead to cognitive overload among students. Cognitive load includes: 1) intrinsic load (IL- due to inherent difficulty of the topic), 2) extraneous (EL- due to presentation of material), and 3) germane (GL- due to extra effort put in for learning). The challenge is to minimize IL and EL and maximize GL. We propose a model to develop cybersecurity learning materials that incorporate both the Bloom’s taxonomy cognitive framework and the design principles of content segmentation and interactivity. We conducted a randomized control/treatment group study to test the proposed model by measuring cognitive load using two eye-tracking metrics (fixation duration and pupil size) between two cybersecurity learning modalities – 1) segmented and interactive modules, and 2) traditional-without segmentation and interactivity (control). Nineteen computer science majors in a large comprehensive university participated in the study and completed a learning module focused on integer overflow in a popular programming language. Results indicate that students in the treatment group had significantly less IL (p &lt. 0.05), EL (p &lt. 0.05), and GL (p &lt. 0.05) as compared to the control group. The results are promising, and we plan to further the work by focusing on increasing the GL. This has interesting potential in designing learning materials in cybersecurity and other computing areas.

Tackling Cybersecurity Regulatory Challenges: A Proposed Research Framework.Although concerns about cybersecurity have been around for more than a decade with significant attention by governments and regulators, the problem has actually continued to increase. So, it is clear that whatever is being done is not working. The research question for this study is: To what extent does compliance help or hinder cybersecurity for the organization – and why/how. When trying to understand the interplay between compliance and cybersecurity, generally, two scenarios may occur: (1) compliance helps security or (2) compliance hinders security – or maybe both. This research attempts to provide a better understanding of the factors by evaluating compliance as a critical factor in the organization’s cybersecurity strategy through a series of corporate and government interviews to affirm, refute, and refine our initial hypotheses.

CyberSecurity Privacy Risks.Privacy is one of the greatest cybersecurity risks due to the extensive reliance on the internet. With the increase in work, social interactions, financial and medical transactions accomplished almost totally online during the pandemic, businesses’ and users’ critical data is at increased risk of exposure or theft. This stolen data can be used to steal corporate secrets, commit espionage or fraud or to steal a person’s identity and financials. Cyber risks cannot be eliminated, they must be managed, there must be an identification of what vulnerabilities will allow threats access to privacy information so that mitigations can be put in place to reduce the probability of the loss of information and privacy.

How Safely Do We Behave Online? An Explanatory Study into the Cybersecurity Behaviors of Dutch Citizens.The Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model states that people’s behavior can be explained by their capabilities, opportunity, motivation, and the interaction between these components. This research focuses on applying the COM-B model to Dutch citizens’ cybersecurity behavior. Data are used from a Dutch cross-sectional online survey (N = 2,426). Multivariate analysis was performed with multivariate linear regression models. The results suggest, in line with the literature, that people that have relevant knowledge, and are motivated to protect themselves, report more cyber secure behavior. The opportunity people have to protect themselves was found to be only partly related to self-reported cybersecurity behavior. Explanations are provided for these findings, as well as opportunities for future research. Cyber hygiene. Human vulnerability. Information assurance. Precautionary behavior 
Towards federated learning-based collaborative adaptive cybersecurity for multi-microgrids.Multi-microgrids (MMGs) provide economic and environmental benefits to society by improving operational flexibility, stability and reliability of a smart grid. MMGs have greater complexity than conventional power networks due to the use of multiple infrastructures, communication protocols, controllers, and intelligent electronic devices. The distributed and heterogeneous connectivity technologies of the MMGs and their need to exchange information with external sources as well as the vulnerabilities in the communication networks and software-based components, make MMGs susceptible to cyberattacks. In this work, we present a conceptual framework for collaborative adaptive cybersecurity that is able to proactively detect security incidents. The framework utilizes federated learning for collaborative training of shared prediction models in a decentralized manner. The methodology used in this research is mainly analytical. This involves analysis of how the principles of a collaborative adaptive cybersecurity can be applied to the MMG environments resulting in the development of theoretical models which can then be validated in practice by prototyping and using real time simulation.

Goal and threat modelling for driving automotive cybersecurity risk analysis conforming to ISO/SAE 21434.As cars are increasingly connected and autonomous, they also become more exposed to cyber security threats. Providing strong protection and reactive response to such threats in a large industry involving many tiers and complex safety critical systems is challenging and required the development of the new ISO 21434 standard. Along with ISO 2626 dedicated to safety, it provides solid grounds for safety-security co-engineering. This paper focuses on how to provide effective and efficient support to the risk assessment phase based on a model-based approach. A rich goal-oriented meta-model is proposed to capture automotive assets and system properties, to estimate the impact of damage scenarios, to identify threats and to assess their feasibility. The approach is implemented as proof-of-concept through the meta-model adaptation of a generic co-engineering platform and is illustrated on the car light control sub-system. Copyright . Automotive.

Federated Blockchained Supply Chain Management: A CyberSecurity and Privacy Framework.The complete transformation of the supply chain in a truly integrated and fully automated process, presupposes the continuous and endless collection of digital information from every stage of the production scale. The aim is not only to investigate the current situation, but also the history for every stage of the chain. Given the heterogeneity of the systems involved in the supply chain and the non-institutional interoperability in terms of hardware and software, serious objections arise as to how these systems are digitally secured. An important issue is to ensure privacy and business confidentiality. This paper presents a specialized and technologically up-to-date framework for the protection of digital security, privacy and industrial-business secrecy. At its core is Federated Learning technology, which operates over Blockchain and applies advanced encryption techniques. Blockchain. Cyber-Security. Federated Learning. Industry 4.0. Meta-learning.

Statistical Reliability of 10 Years of Cyber Security User Studies.Background. In recent years, cyber security user studies have been appraised in meta-research, mostly focusing on the completeness of their statistical inferences and the fidelity of their statistical reporting. However, estimates of the field’s distribution of statistical power and its publication bias have not received much attention. Aim. In this study, we aim to estimate the effect sizes and their standard errors present as well as the implications on statistical power and publication bias. Method. We built upon a published systematic literature review of 146 user studies in cyber security (2006–2016). We took into account 431 statistical inferences including t-, χ2 -, r-, one-way F-tests, and Z-tests. In addition, we coded the corresponding total sample sizes, group sizes and test families. Given these data, we established the observed effect sizes and evaluated the overall publication bias. We further computed the statistical power vis-à-vis of parametrized population thresholds to gain unbiased estimates of the power distribution. Results. We obtained a distribution of effect sizes and their conversion into comparable log odds ratios together with their standard errors. We, further, gained funnel-plot estimates of the publication bias present in the sample as well as insights into the power distribution and its consequences. Conclusions. Through the lenses of power and publication bias, we shed light on the statistical reliability of the studies in the field. The upshot of this introspection is practical recommendations on conducting and evaluating studies to advance the field. Cyber security. Effect estimation. Publication bias. SLR. Statistical power.

Refining the Blunt Instruments of Cybersecurity: A Framework to Coordinate Prevention and Preservation of Behaviours.Background. Cybersecurity controls are deployed to manage risks posed by malicious behaviours or systems. What is not often considered or articulated is how cybersecurity controls may impact legitimate users (often those whose use of a managed system needs to be protected, and preserved). This oversight characterises the ‘blunt’ nature of many cybersecurity controls. Aim. Here we present a framework produced from a synthesis of methods from cybercrime opportunity reduction and behaviour change, and a consideration of existing risk management guidelines. Method. We illustrate the framework and its principles with a range of examples and a potential application focusing on online abuse and social media controls, relating in turn to issues inherent in cyberbullying and tech-abuse. Results. The framework describes a capacity to improve the precision of cybersecurity controls by examining shared determinants of negative and positive behaviours in a system. This identifies opportunities for risk owners to better protect legitimate users while simultaneously acting to prevent malicious activity in a managed system. Conclusions. We describe capabilities for a novel approach to managing sociotechnical cyber-risk which can be integrated into typical risk management processes. This includes consideration of user activities as a system asset to protect, and a consideration of how to engage with other stakeholders to identify behaviours to preserve in a system. Cyber risk.

Multifactor Authentication for Smart Grid Cyber Security.Deployments of smart grids have made the operations of power systems more efficient by using distributed computing power grid—interoperation schemes. The development and evolution of information and communication technologies (ICT) in traditional power systems further increase the improvement of cyber-physical systems (CPS) on the smart grid. IoT-based smart grid systems are critical infrastructures, and they also have complex architectures and include critical device communication systems that can lead to national security deficits, disruption of public order, loss of life, or large-scale economic damage when confidentiality, integrity, or communication availability is broken down owing to cyber threats. There is ample research scope in the industry, government, and academia to strengthen smart security. Authentication is one of the very critical requirements in the design of cyber security. In this paper, multifactor authentication using RSA securID has been proposed to ensure that only approved users can access sensitive grid information with RSA’s proven, self-risk engine.

On the Middleware Design, Cyber-Security, Self-monitoring and Self-healing for the Next-Generation IoT.Internet-of-Things (IoT) is one of the most important technological advances in the realm of Internet-powered cyber-physical and cyber-secure systems of the last decade and likely for many years to come. As such, IoT poses a number of research challenges when it comes to system scalability, availability, inter-operability, security and reliability. We study the programming abstractions, smart middleware, multi-agent systems and cyber-security aspects of what it will take to enable a reliable, secure, inter-operable and human-friendly next-generation IoT. In particular, three important aspects of the NG IoT are discussed in this paper. One, we address software design challenges and appropriate programming abstractions for the software agents that would provide IoT's inter-operability, enabling different users, devices and platforms to effectively communicate and coordinate with each other. We revisit agent-based computing, and especially the Actor model as a potentially perfectly suited programming paradigm for an inherently open, distributed and heterogeneous infrastructure such as NG IoT. Second, we discuss some critical capabilities of the next-generation IoT middleware. Last but not least, to address cyber-security aspects of IoT holistically, we outline several key elements of computational intelligence that could enable the self-healing and self-recovery capabilities of the NG IoT. With such self-defense/self-healing/self-recovery capabilities, future cyber-attacks would be less likely to cause a major disruption to the IoT infrastructure and users. Cyber-security.

Cyber Security Education and Future Provision.Cybersecurity education is a crucial element to provide a workforce for the future to have an awareness together with the skills and knowledge enabling them to adapt and diversify in the field. Cybercrime is covered by the need for distinct aspects of security and measures of control on subsequent systems and devices. As the need for Cybersecurity specialists has increased in recent years and during the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, the provision of education in secondary, post-16 and higher education sectors needs to be met. Utilisation of strategies and innovations to meet industry and educational expectations is key for future provision. Drive for different strategies and innovations in place by governments and organisations throughout the world, as provision in education is not balanced enough to cope with the increasing demand for a cybersecurity workforce. This study will inform recommendations for effective provision of future cybersecurity education. Cybersecurity. Education. Future. Provision 
Cybersecurity and Privacy Capabilities Model for Data Management Against Cyber-Attacks in the Health Sector.In this paper, we propose a model of capabilities that identify the reliability degree of Cybersecurity and Privacy elements applied to the Health Sector. The increasing interactions between technology and the health sector have brought a new set of risks to be confronted, such as data breaches and cyberattacks. However, in order to improve, a greater understanding of their current situation is needed. The proposal identifies the capability level for the organizations to know their maturity level comprehensively. This was achieved by selecting existing models, frameworks, and regulations, increasing their complexity, integrating their privacy and cybersecurity capabilities, and health data management. In this way, the proposal is supported by a tool prepared for outcome estimation and diagnosis. The model structure is organized into categories and subcategories, and the assessment is made according to the level of compliance with controls, for which five levels of maturity were defined: 1. Basic, 2. In Progress, 3. Defined, 4. Differentiated, 5. Continuous Improvement. The model was validated and proven in a private hospital in Lima, Peru. The preliminary results are related to the model application in the selected process. As a result, we found that the private hospital obtained a level of maturity of 2-In Progress. Based on this, we made some recommendations to improve the capacities of the assessed health provider. A comparison was made between the proposed model's results and the ones obtained through its root components. Said results were similar, thus proving that a coherent and comprehensive integration was achieved. Cyber threat intelligence. Cybersecurity. Dark web. Maturity model 
Possibilities of improving the cyber security of mobile devices based on the integration of dynamic biometric methods.The article discusses the possibilities of using biometric authentication methods to improve the cybersecurity of the infrastructure of mobile devices and wearable electronics. It has been established, that approaches for collecting and analyzing parameters are also suitable for the formation of authentication systems for the Internet of things. Analysis and selection of characteristics required for identification are carried out. Biometric methods are based on identifying a person according to his inherent characteristics. The main advantage of biometric methods is that such signs cannot be stolen or transferred to another person. Biometric authentication does not identify a user with absolute precision. There is always a possibility of errors of the first (access denial) and second kind (false access).To solve the problem of providing an additional intermediate layer of data protection and encryption on a physical device, a mobile client-server application has been developed based on the technology of using dynamic biometric authentication methods.

Smart Hospitals and Cyber Security Attacks.Until now, the Covid-19 pandemic was infected more than 37,167,291 people around the world in 212 countries and territories, killed 1,071,181 people since its appearance in December in Wuhan, of which more than 7,876,942 people in the United States, 6,979,434 people in the India and 5,057,958 people in Brazil (Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports - World Health Organization (WHO), 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the U.S -. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – CDC, china Travel Advisory - U.S. State Department, accessed January 31, 2020.). This large number of infected people caused saturation in hospitals and put a big pressure on the intensive care units and hospital beds. While the medical staff are fighting to save the lives of these patients, others are playing with these lives by making cyber-attacks on research centers and health institutions, recently case was in September 2020, a woman in Germany died during a ransomware attack on the Duesseldorf University Hospital. Smart hospitals are one of the most affected because they use its technology (Smart hospitals) that generates a lot of personal and critical data, these hospitals are equipped with things that are used for patient monitoring, maintenance, remote operation and control like wearables, smart pills, smart beds, remote monitoring systems, RTHS (Real-time Health Systems), biosensors, glucose measurement devices, robots, equipment monitoring devices, and more. In this paper, we will propose a new secured system model to keep these hospital systems safe against cyber-attacks by using verification and classification of treatment requests and controlling the patients’ health using sensors to ensure the safety of the requested operations.

Fidelity of Statistical Reporting in 10 Years of Cyber Security User Studies.Studies in socio-technical aspects of security often rely on user studies and statistical inferences on investigated relations to make their case. They, thereby, enable practitioners and scientists alike to judge on the validity and reliability of the research undertaken. To ascertain this capacity, we investigated the reporting fidelity of security user studies. Based on a systematic literature review of 114 user studies in cyber security from selected venues in the 10 years 2006–2016, we evaluated fidelity of the reporting of 1775 statistical inferences using the R package statcheck. We conducted a systematic classification of incomplete reporting, reporting inconsistencies and decision errors, leading to multinomial logistic regression (MLR) on the impact of publication venue/year as well as a comparison to a compatible field of psychology. We found that half the cyber security user studies considered reported incomplete results, in stark difference to comparable results in a field of psychology. Our MLR on analysis outcomes yielded a slight increase of likelihood of incomplete tests over time, while SOUPS yielded a few percent greater likelihood to report statistics correctly than other venues. In this study, we offer the first fully quantitative analysis of the state-of-play of socio-technical studies in security. While we highlight the impact and prevalence of incomplete reporting, we also offer fine-grained diagnostics and recommendations on how to respond to the situation. Cyber security. SLR.

Taxonomy of Cyber Security in Medical Science.Recently, an incrementing number of cyber-attacks in the medical field have resulted in great losses. In the health care industry, since medical information plays an essential role in human health. To prevent from these types of cyber attacks, there are various steps are taken by Hospital Institute Management Systems (HIMS) regarding to its security which is also called cyber security as it is related to computer technology. In response, we have been discussing this misconduct and trying to increase the awareness of researchers, but it seems that there is a lack of research that presents guidelines for editors to help them protect themselves against these threats In this paper, we understand more about cyber security in medical field and a brief overview of cyber securities is presented along with building of cyber securities is explained for the better understanding. We then explain the details involved in each type of attack. Clouds. Cyber crimes. Cyber security. Cyber-attacks. Malware. Phishing. Ransomware 
Cybersecurity enhancement using recurrent neural networks and keystroke dynamics.Three-factor authentication is the best available option for cybersecurity enhancement, which includes ‘know’ (password), ‘have’ (username, token, or card) and ‘are’ (biometrics). Each one makes this process stronger and more secure. Imagine an international team working on a long-term project by remotely logging into a secured server. In such a context, adding keystroke biometrics to authentication will definitely improves the cybersecurity. We propose to develop a set of recurrent neural network (RNN) models of utilizing keystroke dynamics as ones’ biometrics to enhance cybersecurity. Keystroke dynamics refers to the process of measuring and assessing human’s typing rhythm on digital devices. Keystroke timing information such as di-graph, dwell time and flight time are used in our experimental datasets. We propose to apply support vector machine and recurrent neural network to keystroke dynamics. Experimental results show the proposed methods are promising in contrast with traditional methods like nearest neighbor and Manhattan distance. Cybersecurity enhancement. Deep learning.

Implementing Cybersecurity in IoT Using IPAI Algorithm.The Internet of Things (IoT) may be a set of interconnected electronic systems, mechanical and digital systems, items, and species. Or those with identifiers (UIDs) that are able to transmit data over a network without human-to-human or human-to-computer communication being needed. The Internet of Things is the fastest evolving example of the potential of individuals and organisations to transform physical activity. In various areas such as nursing, education and learning, resource management and information processing, the platform has found useful. To extend the cyber protection of networks against ID devices and DDoS attacks that use bandwidth on advanced Internet of Things (IoT) devices, preventive technology has been suggested. Such systems are decentralised and self-configurable and do not need current facilities and protection has become a major concern to be taken into account due to the absence of immense volatile node movements. The suggested solution focuses on the study of the bandwidth attacks inquiry, which primarily targets DDoS, which can be a very difficult task and difficult to track, which decreases network performance. The diagnostic procedures of IDS, which are called add-ons to the intrusion detection system, recognise intrusion security mechanisms in IoT systems to persistently secure and avoid intrusion.

My security: An interactive search engine for cybersecurity.Large volumes of Cybersecurity-related data is generated every day from various sources at high speed to adapt to the fast-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. It drives the emergence of challenges such as the efficient gathering of in-demand information from unstructured and heterogeneous data sources. After collecting sufficient data, it is hard for users to understand the message hidden behind without adequate security domain knowledge. To help address this problem, in this paper, we present My Security, an innovative search engine for gathering, managing, and understanding cybersecurity-related data. My Security is based on a novel indexing approach that stores both the information of data sources (e.g., publication date, authorship) and the pragmatics messages, including security category (e.g., ransomware, data breach) and corresponding security components (e.g., time of the event, impacted systems). With the established index, users can retrieve cybersecurity information through comprehensive approaches. Fetched results are provided with interpretations leveraged from pragmatics indexing. Additional data mining and visualization techniques enhance the interactivity of My Security by presenting the retrieved results in a clear and comprehensible manner with cybersecurity expertise. It is demonstrated that My Security is efficient at satisfying users' requirements for searching security data and helping people gain better insights into cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity risk assessment framework for externally exposed energy delivery systems.Securing the energy delivery system (EDS) from complex, nonlinear, and evolving cyber threats requires a complex set of changing and interwoven classes of technologies, policies, relationships, and personnel. One key area in this technological milieu is assessment methodologies to compare information, gathered by a variety of means, about networked devices with publicly known possible threat information about said devices. This information is used to generate risk-based characterizations that allow for the adjudication and proper corresponding management action chains to be assigned. To address the current cybersecurity needs in the operational technology (OT) domain, we developed a novel relative-risk assessment framework and a software application called MEEDS that can detect exposed OT systems. This paper presents the detailed architecture of relative-risk assessment framework methodology and its integral role in the MEEDS software. The efficacy of the presented framework is demonstrated by testing with the real-world systems and vulnerabilities pertaining to the industrial control systems (ICS) in critical infrastructures.

Constructing a methodology for developing a cybersecurity program.This paper serves to introduce the problem of constructing a methodology to develop a cybersecurity program. The goal of the program is to prepare students graduating from an accredited two-year college for success in cybersecurity careers. Several challenges must be addressed such as program accreditation, workforce development, and DHS/NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) designation. All of these serve as inputs in constructing a methodology to develop such a program to meet local industry needs for cyber professionals.
Revealing the cyber security non-compliance Attribution gulf.Non-compliance is a well-known issue in the field of cyber security. Non-compliance usually manifests in an individual's sins of omission or commission, and it is easy to conclude that the problem is attributable to their personal flawed decision making. However, the individual's decision not to comply is likely also to be influenced by a range of environmental and contextual factors. Bordieu, for example, suggests that personal habitus influences decisions. We identified a wide range of possible explanations for non-compliance from the research literature and classified these, finding that a number of the identified factors were indeed habitus related. We then used Q-methodology to determine which of these non-compliance explanations aligned with public attributions of non-compliance causatives. We discovered an attribution gulf, with popular opinion attributing non-compliance primarily to individual failings or ignorance. The existence of this attribution gap means that those designing cyber security interventions are likely to neglect the influence of habitus on choices and decisions. We need to broaden our focus if non-compliance is to be reduced.
Organizational aspects of cyber security in family firms - An empirical study of German companies.In the context of increasing digitalization and networking, the importance of cyber security for family businesses is also growing and is moving onto the management agenda as a cross-divisional, group-wide challenge. A study of 184 German companies shows that although family businesses identify cyber security as a relevant field of action, they do not take sufficient account of the organizational framework and process implementation. This paper is dedicated to the investigation of this phenomenon. Possible causes of this phenomenon are discussed. Based on this, recommendations for action are given.
Enhancing cybersecurity capability in local governments through competency-based education.Local government agencies face significant challenges related to cybersecurity. Advances in cybersecurity threats have been part of the difficulty, but government agencies, particularly communities, also face unique challenges given their broad mandates and challenges. This is particularly true in large metropolitan areas where activities cross many local and county jurisdictions yet require a coordinated and collaborative response. Local jurisdictions face differing cybersecurity challenges related to local issues such as criminal activity, population, and the mix of land use as well as external considerations such as ports, airports and international borders requiring enhanced coordination with state and federal authorities. Rapid ongoing changes in technology also provide a relentless pattern of change which must be managed. These widely differing challenges, along with resource constraints, lead neighboring communities to possess widely varying cybersecurity capabilities. This research project is an effort to speed the process of training and developing talent to meet these challenges.
Does high cybersecurity capability lead to openness in digital trade? The mediation effect of e-government maturity.Cybersecurity risks threaten the digital economy, including digital trade enabled by digital technologies. As parts of cybersecurity capability building, governments implement fragmented, in-flux policies to manage cybersecurity threats from cross-border digital activities. However, the lack of shared understandings of cybersecurity within cross-border digital innovations raises an increasing debate about how cybersecurity capability building policies can impact digital trade restrictions. This study develops a National Cyber Trade Behavior model to examine the relationship between national cybersecurity capability and digital trade restrictions. Utilizing the PLS-SEM-based path analysis, we draw empirical evidence to verify the developed model and reveal that building cybersecurity capability can indirectly support an open digital trade system, mediated by E-government maturity.
Mahive: Modular analysis hierarchical intrusion detection system visualization event cybersecurity engine for cyber-physical systems and internet of things devices.Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), including Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks, have become critical to our national infrastructure. The increased occurrence of cyber-attacks on these systems and the potential for catastrophic losses illustrates the critical need to ensure our CPS and ICS are properly monitored and secured with a multi-pronged approach of prevention, detection, deterrence, and recovery. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) lack features that would make them well-suited for CPS and ICS environments. We report on the initial results for MAHIVE: Modular Analysis Hierarchical IDS Visualization Event cybersecurity engine. MAHIVE differs from traditional IDS in that it was specifically designed and developed for CPS, ICS, a IIoT systems and networks. We describe the MAHIVE architecture, the design, and the results of our evaluation using two ICS testbed penetration testing experiments.
Organizational cybersecurity: Advanced cyber defense, cyber analytics, and security minitrack overview.Cybersecurity touches all aspects of organizational management, with organizational systems, networks and critical infrastructures increasingly targeted by determined malicious actors with advanced skills and resources. Such attacks have the potential for major disruption of our society including damage to assets, people, and the environment. Organizations, of all sizes and at all levels, are faced with the challenge of continuously, effectively, and efficiently protecting their systems while enabling and ensuring their mission. Organizational cybersecurity aims to advance knowledge on the theory and practice of cybersecurity management.
Simulating municipal cybersecurity incidents: Recommendations from expert interviews.As cyberattacks on city and public infrastructures become increasingly common and harmful, it is critical that we train the professional workforce to prepare and respond appropriately. This paper supports the development of educational simulations and related experiential learning exercises that help prepare city and public infrastructure personnel to effectively respond to cybersecurity attacks. Specifically, it synthesizes the findings from 8 expert interviews including 12 cybersecurity experts from federal, state, city organizations, as well as academics with relevant expertise. We organize the findings into key learning outcomes, scenarios, roles, and issues that simulation designers should consider. The result paints a vivid picture of the complex socio-technical context of city and public infrastructure attacks and responses and the most salient skills needed to respond to them.
One single click is enough - An empirical study on human threats in family firm cyber security.The present study focuses on the tension between human versus technical risks in German companies. It examines how employees counter cybercrime and how this affects the company. Aim is to analyze human threats in family businesses and to create opportunities to use the human factor as an opportunity in the context of technological change. For this, an empirical study among 184 German firms was conducted. In general, the results demonstrate an insufficient awareness of the topic in the companies. Although companies are aware of the need for trained employees, there is a backlog of demand for workshops and awareness raising. Employees are detected as the main security risk, especially in family businesses. Better employee training is therefore indispensable. However, even training courses cannot prevent employees from making mistakes in the area of cyber security. Therefore, it can be emphasized that additional organizational security measures are necessary.
Ethical Principles for Designing Responsible Offensive Cyber Security Training.In this paper we present five principles for designing ethically responsible offensive cyber security training. The principles can be implemented in existing or new study plans and target both academic and non-academic courses. Subject matter experts within various cyber security domains were consulted to validate and fine tune the principles, together with a literature review of ethical studies in related domains. The background for designing the principles is the continuous popularity of offensive cyber security (penetration testing, ethical hacking). Offensive cyber security means actively trying to break or compromise a system in order to find its vulnerabilities. If this expertise is placed in the wrong hands, the person can cause severe damage to organizations, civilians and society at large. The proposed ethical principles are created in order to mitigate these risks while maintaining the upsides of offensive cyber security. This is achieved by incorporating the ethical principles in offensive cyber security training, in order to facilitate the practitioners with ethical knowledge of how and when to use their acquired expertise.

Skill mismatch evidence for cybersecurity skills in Morocco. Skill mismatch is worldwide issue as it can be effect job satisfaction, wages and multiple other factors. Analyzing selft-reported skill mismatch is highly studied in prior work. In this paper we study evidence of skill mismatch between three categories: Professionals, Students and Faculty member. We collect data from a survey. In this paper we use the Chi-Test to find evidence of skill mismatch between Professionals, Faculty members and students. We suppose that the three proportions are equals which means they agree on the importance of skills. If the hypothesis in not true we use the Marascuillo procedure to make comparisons between all pairs of groups Results of our paper shows that categories agree on the importance of skills categories especially programming languages. However, we find evidence of a mismatch between skills types especially Databases and Audit and risk analysis. We also find agreement between groups for some skills such as C++, as participants agree that this skill is not highly used in the cybersecurity job market.Skill mismatch

National Time Synchronization Augmenting Cybersecurity.The essential matter is to get the time synchronization of country-linked communication infrastructures, computer systems and devices to the IST (Indian Standard Time). The competence to demonstrate its sequence of traceability to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) originated by BIPM, with adequate lawful/governing support. This has acute share in real-time applications in critical service sector and to national security. Given the significance of cybersecurity and cybercrime angle developing the formation of Distributed Timing Infrastructures to several critical sectors and customer-centric timing delivery methods is the requirement of time. The International Standards ISO/IEC 18014 under a generally used title of Information technology—Security techniques—Time stamping services consisting of three parts, including a general notion, time stamping service model, data structures as well as protocols in its part 1(2008), 2(2008) & 3(2009) and Part 4(2015) for traceability of time sources has been adopted in many countries. It gives a speedy thought to have a precise Nationwide Timing strategy that shall address time delivery services that could be chosen by the wide range of users with acceptable level of uncertainties.

A university's developmental framework: Creating, implementing, and evaluating a K-12 teacher cybersecurity micro-credential course. At present, there is a gap in research surrounding cybersecurity micro-credentials and their impact on K-12 teachers. This work evaluates a university's development of a computing-based learning and teaching environment for K-12 teachers, focusing on a cybersecurity micro-credential course. This ongoing work consists of pre-pilot and pilot research over an academic year (2020-2021). The primary research question explores the extent to which the cybersecurity micro-credential was considered helpful to K-12 teachers. The authors developed two modules: Introduction to cybersecurity and CIA Triad. Nine K-12 teachers enrolled in the course, with five participating in all aspects of the pilot study. The authors utilized quantitative and qualitative data collection via four methods: 1) Assessment scores (quantitative). 2) five semi-structured interviews (qualitative). 3) two bi-weekly progress reports (qualitative) and 4) one focus group (qualitative). They assessed teachers' knowledge gains in specific cybersecurity and computing. Interview questions, focus group and bi-weekly progress reports were coded and grouped into major themes by searching descriptive words. The work showcases innovative tools for teaching cybersecurity. Lastly, the authors describe a method to deliver cybersecurity content through a micro-credential based virtual professional development for K-12 teachers. The main limitation in this work is the small sample size. Copyright . Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity education. Microcredential. Virtual professional development 
Inadequacy of IT Approaches to Manage Cyber Security in ICS Context.The paper Inadequacy of IT approaches to manage cyber security in ICS context gives an overview of the application of different IT solutions to deal with cyber security for industrial control systems (ICSs). The real time aspect is important for ICSs to monitor and control effectively different processes. On the other hand, some traditional IT solutions for cyber security do not comply with it. After a careful analysis, it is concluded that there is no ISO 27001 requirement to meet the non interference cyber security goal, used by the working group PCSRF in the System Protection Profile for ICSs to ensure that the security functions are implemented in a non-interfering way and do not affect the performance constraints of ICSs. Therefore, a new component, called Cyber Safety, is proposed to be added to the existing ones (confidentiality, integrity and availability). Its role would be to check the safety requirements (controls or measures) before their implementations. It is proposed a new model for the management of the cyber security risks that reuses existing results issued from the safety risk analysis and may add safety requirements. Critical infrastructure.

Evaluating cybersecurity attitudes and behaviors in Portuguese healthcare institutions.The growing digitization of healthcare institutions and its increasing dependence on Internet infrastructure has boosted the concerns related to data privacy and confidentiality. These institutions have been challenged with specific issues, namely the sensitivity of data, the specificity of networked equipment, the heterogeneity of healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, administrative staff and other) and the IT skills they have. In this paper we present the results obtained with a study made with healthcare professionals on evaluating their awareness level with the information security, namely by assessing their attitudes and behaviours in cybersecurity. The methodology consisted in translating, adjusting and applying two previously validated and already published Likert-type response scales, in a healthcare institution in Portugal, namely Centro Hospitalar Barreiro Montijo (CHBM). The scales used were cybersecurity risky behaviour (RScB) and cybersecurity and cybercrime in business attitudes (ATC-IB). Although there were no significant statistical differences between the sociodemographic factors and the scores obtained on both scales, the results showed a relationship between acquired behaviours and the attitudes of involvement with work and organizational commitment, establishing a bridge for the quantification in awareness.
Cybersecurity of Technological Facilities and Industries in the Era of Digital Transformation.Information technology has become the basis of modern management and economic systems. Without it, the functioning of all types of infrastructures, the development of the state and the maintenance of the vital functions of an ordinary person are no longer possible. The demand for the protection systems of technological facilities and industrial control systems from cyber threats, both external and internal, will grow every year, and will increase with the increase in the number of implemented automated systems and digitalization of the fuel and energy complex. Any illegal interference in the network can bring significant damage to both a single citizen, and for a particular enterprise and the state as a whole. The article discusses several echelons of protecting systems of automated process control systems of enterprises from cyber-attacks, considers promising technologies for protecting information from cyber threats up to 2030 for industrial systems. The short-term, medium-term and long-term tasks facing the state of the Russian Federation in the direction of ensuring information security of process control systems are considered.

Evaluating the Cybersecurity of an Enterprise Based on a Genetic Algorithm.Most of the extremely important objects used in practical human activities are systems. They have a complex structural organization and (or) functioning. Herewith, it is important to note that the structural integrity and functioning of systems can be ensured by stabilizing their features and properties. In this connection, the security of these systems begins to play an extremely important role. The structural and functioning stability depends on factors affecting the system, which can be defined as security threats, vulnerabilities, and measures to ensure system security. Each of the components listed is a complex parametric structure with many properties and parameters. In these circumstances, to evaluate the system security, it is required to correlate threats, vulnerabilities, and security measures. The parameters of threats and vulnerabilities may have both quantitative and qualitative specifications, which limits the possibility of applying mathematical methods. For this reason, these parameters should be formalized in a numerical form. To solve this issue, a pairwise comparison of linguistic structures can be used. A feature of the approach proposed herein is the possibility of its implementation in the form of algorithmic provision and software that will allow automating the work of analysts responsible for the development of tactics and strategies to ensure the security of any institution or organization. This fact reflects the practical usefulness of the approach proposed. Genetic algorithm. Mathematical modeling. Measures to combat threats. Security. Security threats. System vulnerabilities 
Systems Important for NPP Safety: Software Verification and Cybersecurity.Software verification and validation is the principal and most common type of activity for ensuring the quality of software systems, including those with a rising risk of the operation, throughout the entire life cycle. The software for systems important for nuclear power-plant (NPP safety) is subject to increased requirements for reliability and stability of operation, and for cybersecurity. The complex structure of automated process control systems of NPP and a large number of cybersecurity management tools make it difficult to verify and use cybersecurity management tools at all stages of the object’s life cycle from design to operation. The paper proposes a methodology for verifying and validating software for systems important to NPP safety, based on a high-qualitative cybersecurity management model to ensure the required level of cybersecurity. The methodology allows it to apply the concept of adaptive testing and simulate making and eliminating errors at each stage of software development. This methodology is using in the development of top-level systems of NPP APCS. Cybersecurity. Nuclear power-plant. Software. Validation. Verification

Cyber Security Management Model for Critical Infrastructure and Improving the Security Level on Transferring Digital Data.Cyber security is the most important part of our technologically dependent lives today. Government institutions, financial firms, public and private services, nuclear power stations, power grid providers, water supplies or wastewater disposal corporations use information technology in their day-to-day activities. Anything that uses technology is focused on connectivity and computer networks, which ensures that it relies on cyber security. Every year, the public and private sectors spend millions of dollars on technology, protection tools and hardware that can improve cyber security within their businesses, but are still vulnerable. The key problem with this situation is that data defense is now generally viewed as a technological component or technology that can be quickly introduced within the enterprise, and this application would ensure cyber protection. This mentality needs to change, because cyber security is more than mere technology nowadays. This post presents the taxonomy of critical infrastructure threats, analyses attack vectors and attack tactics used to destroy critical infrastructure, as well as the most frequent cyber security failures that companies create in the area of cyber security while attempting to make themselves safer from vulnerabilities. The main purpose of this article is to include technical elements of the cyber security management model that can be used to ensure the protection of sensitive infrastructure in an enterprise or business. The network protection management model discussed in this article is examined from a management viewpoint and does not discuss the technical issues and products used to secure sensitive infrastructure from cyber security threats and vulnerabilities.

Missing and Incomplete Data Handling in Cybersecurity Applications.In intelligent information systems data plays a critical role. Preparing data for the use of artificial intelligence is therefore a substantial step in the processing pipeline. Sometimes, modest improvements in data quality can translate into a vastly superior model. The issue of missing data is one of the commonplace problems occurring in data collected in the real world. The problem stems directly from the very nature of data collection. In this paper, the notion of handling missing values in a real-world application of computational intelligence is considered. Six different approaches to missing values are evaluated, and their influence on the results of the Random Forest algorithm trained using the CICIDS2017 intrusion detection benchmark dataset is assessed. In result of the experiments it transpired that the chosen algorithm for data imputation has a severe impact on the results of the classifier used for network intrusion detection. It also comes to light that one of the most popular approaches to handling missing data - complete case analysis - should never be used in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. Data imputation. Data science.

Cybersecurity Education and Formal Methods. Formal methods have been largely thought of in the context of safety-critical systems, where they have achieved major acceptance. Tens of millions of people trust their lives every day to such systems, based on formal proofs rather than we haven’t found a bug (yet!). but why is we haven’t found a bug an acceptable basis for systems trusted with hundreds of millions of people’s personal data? This paper looks at some of these issues in cybersecurity, and the extent to which formal methods, ranging from fully verified to better tool support, could help. More importantly, recent policy reports and curricula initiatives appear to recommended formal methods in the limited context of safety critical applications. we suggest this is too limited in scope and ambition. Not only are formal methods needed in cybersecurity, the repeated and very public weaknesses of the cybersecurity industry provide a powerful motivation for formal methods. Curricula. Cybersecurity.

Heterogeneous preferences and patterns of contribution in cybersecurity as a public good.This paper presents an agent-based model of contribution to cybersecurity as a participatory public good. Ineffective cybersecurity measures pose serious threats and risks to the development and stability of information societies in the world. Hence, different doctrines and thesis have been suggested to explore how this domain should be treated by the public and private stakeholders. Cybersecurity as a public good is one of these doctrines that accordingly, cybersecurity is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. In this paper, we present a model of social preferences reflecting the concepts of altruism, individualism, aggressiveness, and reciprocity. It describes an agent-based model simulating a repeated public goods game among a set of defenders that are in an uncertain environment with incomplete and imperfect information. In the model, defenders have a probability to choose contribution or being a free-rider, depending on their own preferences and facing with revealed preferences of other defenders. This model implements a utility maximization that applies to each individual, modeling the existence of free-riders, punishments, and interdependency of decisions on the social context. The results of this simulation show that, over time, defenders update their preferences in reaction to the behavior of other defenders and the experience of cyber-attacks. Moreover, they indicate a high level of contribution to the provision of cybersecurity as a public good and the effectiveness of punishment on increasing the contributions. This paper demonstrated how agent-based models can be used to examine this doctrine and investigate whether this doctrine complies with the unique characteristics of cybersecurity.

Remote Technical Labs: An Innovative and Scalable Component for University Cybersecurity Program Admission.In response to the existing and predicted skills gap in cybersecurity, educational institutions establish an increased number of studies. Admission boards need to screen large numbers of applicants to identify those with the highest probability of successful completion. To address the current lack of scalable and validated admission procedures with predictive value, we present a validation of an innovative university admission process for a master level program including technical skills assessment via cloud-based virtual labs. A regression model based on data collected during admission assessment procedures is applied to predict later study performance in technical courses. The virtual labs assessing technical skills but also interview component had comparably high predictive values for study performance, indicating a complementary relationship of two distinct skill-sets. The primary conclusion of this research is that cybersecurity technical labs can be used to significantly improve the predictive value of traditional interview-based admission processes for the candidates’ later success in technical courses.

Using Competency Mapping for Skills Assessment in an Introductory Cybersecurity Course.Various courses and trainings aim to teach cybersecurity with only few measures for learning outcomes. Existing metrics such as general grades do not reflect the various competencies and specific outcomes that make up a course. More specific measures targeting competencies are needed: this differentiated approach must reflect course specificities, but also be general enough to be transferable to other courses. This study presents a competency mapping approach based on the NIST NICE framework, demonstrated in a cybersecurity course on bachelor level. The approach enables to evaluate specific competencies and their relevance to various cybersecurity job roles. Additionally, this type of competency mapping can provide useful insights for designing and managing the course content in general. Competency mapping. Computer science education. Cybersecurity.

Using Delphi and System Dynamics for IoT Cybersecurity: Preliminary Airport Implications.Day by day, airports adopt more IoT devices. However, airports are not exempt from possible failures due to malware's proliferation that can abuse vulnerabilities. Computer criminals can access, corrupt, and extract information from individuals or companies. This paper explains the development of a propagation model, which started with a Delphi process. We discuss the preliminary implications for airports of the simulation model built from the Delphi recommendations.
Ontology-based cybersecurity and resilience framework.In the digital age, almost all organizations have become dependent on Information Technology (IT) systems at different levels of their individual and collective activities. Physical infrastructures are inextricably tied to the functioning of IT systems that are vulnerable to internal and external cyber threats. Attacks can cause unavailability or malfunction of systems which in turn prevent or mislead ongoing business processes in organizations. Today, organizations not only require cybersecurity programs to protect themselves against cyber threats but also need a resilience strategy to guarantee business continuity even during cyber incidents. This paper includes the results of ongoing research for securing maritime port ecosystems and making them cyber resilient. We propose a framework based on ontologies and logical inference to meet requirements of resilient IT systems regarding response to and recovery from cyber incidents. Copyright . Inference System.

Detecting cyber security attacks against a microservices application using distributed tracing.Microservices are emerging as the dominant software design architecture for many different applications, and cyber attacks are targeting more software organisations every day. Newer techniques for detecting cyber intrusions against such applications are in high demand. Application functionality that is executed within a microservices application can be monitored and logged using distributed tracing. Distributed tracing is normally used for performance management of microservices applications. In this paper, we used distributed tracing for detecting cyber-security attacks. Each microservice call, or sequence of calls, executed in response to a request by an end user of the application is logged as a trace. Anomaly detection is a means of detecting irregular or unusual events or patterns in a data set that occur to a greater or a lesser degree than the majority of the data. In this paper, we present initial work that identifies anomalous distributions of traces. A frequency distribution of traces is obtained from normal data and traffic is identified as an anomaly candidate if it differs sufficiently from the base distribution. This approach is evaluated using a password guessing attack. In addition, we briefly discuss a NoSQL injection attack which we argue is difficult to detect using trace data. Copyright .

Automatic detection of cyber security events from turkish twitter stream and newspaper data.Cybersecurity experts scan the internet and face security events that influence user and institutions. An information security analyst regularly examines sources to stay up to date on security events in the domain of expertise. This may lead to a heavy workload for the information analysts if they do not have proper tools for security event investigation. For example, an information analyst may want to stay aware of cybersecurity events, such as a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on a government agency website. The earlier they detect and understand the threats, the longer the time remaining to alleviate the obstacle and to investigate the event. Therefore, information security analysts need to establish and keep situational awareness active about the security events and their likely effects. However, due to the large volume of information flow, it may be difficult for security analysts and researchers to detect and analyze security events timely. It is important to detect security events timely. This study aims at developing tools that are able to provide timely reports of security incidents. A recent challenge is that the internet community use different languages to share information. For instance, information about security events in Turkey is mostly shared on the internet in Turkish. The present study investigates automatic detection of security incidents in Turkish by processing data from Twitter and news media. It proposes an automatic prototype, Turkish-specific software system that can detect cybersecurity events in real time. Copyright . Cyber Security. Event Detection. Hürriyet Newspaper. Turkish.

Unconventional attack against voting machines enlarging the scope of cybersecurity risk analysis.Most modern democracies and states have adopted a large number of standards and norms to promote and harmonize international trade. The precautionary principle has come to complete this regulatory arsenal especially in the field of security of states and citizens, their health, their private life ... The aim is also to protect government agencies against wrong decisions, especially when uncertain, immature technologies are concerned. Social, political, institutional security and stability and now cybersecurity has become heavily dependent on these new forms of regulation. In this article we will show how this regulation arsenal could be exploited by cybercriminals. It is indeed possible through a broader vision of the notion of cyber attack to turn these norms and standards and this precautionary principle precisely against those they are supposed to protect. Among many possible scenarios, we consider a specific one for illustration with respect to the attack of voting machines. The main conclusion is that any (cyber)security risk analysis should now extend the mostly favoured technical view to a more operational vision in which non technical aspects also be included.

Accessible cyber security: The next frontier?.Researchers became aware of the need to pay attention to the usability of cyber security towards the end of the 20th century. This need is widely embraced now, by both academia and industry, as it has become clear that users are a very important link in the security perimeter of organisations. Two decades later, I will make the case for the inclusion and importance of a third dimension of human-centred security, that of accessibility. I will argue that technical measures, usability and accessibility should be equally important considerations during the design of security systems. Unless we do this, we risk ignoring the needs of vast swathes of the population with a range of disabilities. For many of these, security measures are often exasperatingly inaccessible. This talk is a call to action to the community of human-centred security researchers, all of whom have already made huge strides in improving the usability of security mechanisms. Copyright .
Cybersecurity for SMEs: Introducing the human element into socio-technical cybersecurity risk assessment.Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) rarely conduct a thorough cyber-risk assessment and they may face various internal issues when attempting to set up cyber-risk strategies. In this work, we apply a user journey approach to model human behaviour and visually map SMEs’ practices and threats, along with a visualisation of the socio-technical actor network, targeted specifically at the risks highlighted in the user journey. By using a combination of cybersecurity-related visualisations, our goals are: i) to raise awareness about cybersecurity, and ii) to improve communication among IT personnel, security experts, and non-technical personnel. To achieve these goals, we combine two modelling languages: Customer Journey Modelling Language (CJML) is a visual language for modelling and visualisation of work processes in terms of user journeys. System Security Modeller (SSM) is an asset-based risk-analysis tool for socio-technical systems. By demonstrating the languages’ supplementary nature through a threat scenario and considering related theories, we believe that there is a sound basis to warrant further validation of CJML and SSM together to raise awareness and handle cyber threats in SMEs.

Cybersecurity Analysis for a Remote Drug Dosing and Adherence Monitoring System.Remote health monitoring and medication systems are becoming prevalent owing to the advances in sensing and connectivity technologies as well as the social and economical demands due to high health care costs as well as low availability of skilled health care providers. The significance of such devices and coordination are also highlighted in the context of recent pandemic outbreaks underlying the need for physical distancing as well as even lock-downs globally. Though such devices bring forth large scale benefits, being the safety critical nature of such applications, one has to be vigilant regarding the potential risk factors. Apart from the device and application level faults, ensuring the secure operation becomes paramount due to increased network connectivity of these systems and services. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for identification of cyber threats and vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them in the context of remote medication and monitoring devices. We specifically elaborate our approach and present the results using a case study of an electronic medication device. Cybersecurity. Medical IoT. Medicine dosage. Remote adherence monitoring.

Cybersecurity Methodology for Specialized Behavior Analysis.Analyzing attacker behavior and generating realistic models to accurately capture the realities of cybersecurity threats is a very challenging task for researchers. Psychological personality and profiling studies provide a broad understanding of personality traits, but lack a level of interactive immersion that enables observers to collect concrete cybersecurity-relevant behavioral data. Participant’s intricate actions and interactions with real computer systems are seldom captured in any cybersecurity studies. Our work focuses on capturing human actions and decisions to provide an empirical basis for these types of models. We provide a practical methodology that helps bridge the gap between theory and practice by facilitating construction, experimentation, and data collection for repeatable and scalable human experimentation with realistic cybersecurity scenarios. While our methodology is platform agnostic, we describe state of the art technologies that may be used to satisfy the objectives of each of the stages of the methodology. Attacker profiling.

CybSecMLC: A Comparative Analysis on Cyber Security Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning Classifiers.With the rapid growth of the Internet and smartphone and wireless communication-based applications, new threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks also increased. The attackers always use communication channels to violate security features. The fast-growing of security attacks and malicious activities create a lot of damage to society. The network administrators and intrusion detection systems (IDS) were also unable to identify the possibility of network attacks. However, many security mechanisms and tools are evolved to detect the vulnerabilities and risks involved in wireless communication. Apart from that machine learning classifiers (MLCs) also practical approaches to detect intrusion attacks. These MLCs differentiated the network traffic data as two parts one is abnormal and other regular. Many existing systems work on the in-depth analysis of specific attacks in network intrusion detection systems. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed inspection of some existing MLCs for identifying the intrusions in the wireless network traffic. Notably, we analyze the MLCs in terms of various dimensions like feature selection and ensemble techniques to identify intrusion detection. Finally, we evaluated MLCs using the NSL-KDD dataset and summarize their effectiveness using a detailed experimental evolution. Feature selection. Intrusion detection systems.

The use of gamification to teach cybersecurity awareness in information systems.This paper investigates the impact of gamification in teaching and learning cybersecurity awareness. The increasing rate of cyber-attacks and data breaches in recent times, have made cybersecurity awareness a critical learning objective in Information Systems (IS) curriculum globally. However, teaching and learning cybersecurity awareness can be challenging, especially to smaller colleges and universities who have meagre resources. Moreover, learning cybersecurity principles requires understanding of concepts that are usually unfamiliar to students in the IS major. In order to effectively deliver the desired learning objectives in cybersecurity awareness, IS educators can adopt pedagogical approaches, e.g., gamification, that are interactive, fun and appealing to students. Gamification which has been defined as the use of game components to deliver learning objectives in a given area, offer an alternative that is affordable, easy to learn and requires very little to no overhead cost. Currently, the authors are designing 3 gamified activities that can be used to teach and learn cyber security awareness. We intend to validate the effectiveness of these activities using experimental approaches. Students will be randomly selected from universities in Northern Pennsylvania, USA, and divided into experimental and control group. Experimental group will be asked to complete the gamified activities. Data will be collected using questionnaire. Data analysis will be by means of statistical approaches such as ANOVA, paired t-test of factor analysis. We hope that the results of our study will support the use of gamification in teaching and learning cybersecurity awareness. Cyber awareness. Cyber-attacks. Cyber-threats. Cybersecurity.

Virtualization and Automation for Cybersecurity Training and Experimentation.In response to the increasing number and complexity of cyber threats, universities, industry, and government agencies are widely employing network emulation environments for cybersecurity training and experimentation. These environments, known as cyber ranges, can model enterprise networks and sophisticated attacks, providing a realistic experience for the users. Building and deploying such environments is currently very time consuming, especially for complex scenarios and a high number of participants to the training exercises. This paper presents how virtualization and automation tools can be used to address this issue, starting from the formal specification of the emulated network environment to the automated deployment and replication of virtual machines. Our approach is based on widely used technologies and allows building tailored environments that fulfill organization needs for specific training, exercise, research, and development. Automation.

Distant Supervision for Relations Extraction via Deep Residual Learning and Multi-instance Attention in Cybersecurity.A large number of open source threat intelligence resources provide regularly updated threat sources that can be applied to a variety of security analysis solutions. Fragmented security news, security forums, and vulnerability information are important sources of cyber threat intelligence, but it is difficult to correlate these multiple-source data. Cybersecurity knowledge graph is a powerful tool for data-driven thread intelligence computing. Relation extraction is a very important task in construction of cybersecurity knowledge graph from unstructured data. In order to reduce the influence of noisy data in deep learning model, we propose a distant supervised relation extraction model ResPCNN-ATT based on deep residual convolutional neural network and attention mechanism. This method takes word vector and position vector of the word as input of the model, extracts semantic features of texts through the piecewise convolutional neural network model PCNN, achieves the learning effect of less noisy data and better extracts deep semantic features in sentenses by using deep residuals Compared with other models, the model proposed in this paper achieves higher accuracy than other models.

Cyber Security Attacks on Identity and Location of Vehicle Ad-Hoc Networks.Vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) technology arose from the mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) and the first mention of the term was in 2003. VANET allows vehicles to communicate with other vehicles and other intelligent transport systems (ITS) facilities in their location range. This paper presents a literature review and identify the security requirements needed to achieve a secure VANET environment. It also identifies a VANET cybersecurity attack, with a focus on attacks that target the location and identity of other vehicles as well as the ability to detect previous attacks. Moreover, this research started by introducing VANET architecture, communication and applications. Then, defining the important security requirements based on the three-information security triangle with an emphasis on the VANET environment.

Context-Bound Cybersecurity Framework for Resisting Eavesdropping in Vehicle Networks.Wireless channels that are widely adopted between autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to eavesdropping or interferences, so that attacks on cybersecurity may lead to serious consequences, such as losing control of vehicles. In particular, the cryptographic methods used for information security rely on the strict privacy of keys, which is often difficult to guarantee in a wireless environment. This paper proposes a context-bound cybersecurity framework, which protects communication from eavesdroppers by encrypting critical data with a dynamic context among vehicles. The context is synchronized among vehicles through a progressive encoding method, which makes it difficult for third parties to learn the entire context by eavesdropping through the channels, especially in the case of mobility. The normal vehicles may extract a security key from the context to encrypt and decrypt key data, but it is impossible or overwhelmingly expensive for the third parties to decode the data transmitted due to the lack of the context. Besides, the proposed framework also provides a promising way to resist the upcoming quantum computers, because it will become more and more difficult for third parties to collect the complete context as the context continues to update.

Addressing Cybersecurity in the Next Generation Mobility Ecosystem with CARAMEL.The proliferation of next generation mobility, promotes the use of autonomous cars, connected vehicles and electromobility. It creates novel attack surfaces for high impact cyberattacks affecting the society. Addressing the cybersecurity challenges introduced by modern vehicles requires a proactive and multi-faceted approach combining techniques originating from various domains of ICT. Emerging technologies such as 5G, LiDAR, novel in-vehicle and roadside sensors and smart charging, used in modern cars, introduce new challenges and potential security gaps in the next generation mobility ecosystem. Thus, it is critical that the domain's cybersecurity must be approached in a structured manner from a multi-domain and multi-technology perspective. The CARAMEL H2020 project aims to address the cybersecurity challenges on the pillars upon which the next generation mobility is constructed (i.e., autonomous mobility, connected mobility, electromobility). To achieve that, advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques will be utilized for the identification of anomalies and the classification of incoming signals indicating a cyber-attack or a cybersecurity risk. Apart from risk detection, methods for the mitigation of the identified risks will also be continuously incorporated to the CARAMEL solution. The final goal of CARAMEL is to create an anti-hacking platform for the European automotive cybersecurity and to demonstrate its value through extensive attack and penetration scenarios. In this paper we will expand on the unique cybersecurity-relevant characteristics of the pillars upon which the CARAMEL solution is built. Next, a number of use cases emerging from such analysis will be extracted in order to form the basis upon which the CARAMEL platform will be evaluated. Finally, we will conclude with an overview of the platform's architectural composition. artificial intelligence. automated mobility. connected mobility. cybersecurity 
A review on cybersecurity vulnerabilities for urban air mobility.Recent developments of high-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have allowed for urban air mobility (UAM) to become a reality. While these flying cars' propulsive technology has almost become economically viable, the infrastructure to allow these vehicles to operate in an urban environment is still lacking. With numerous known vulnerabilities in UAVs and commercial aircraft, manufacturers have not addressed cybersecurity in the scope of urban air mobility. This paper presents a review of several known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and previous attacks associated with UAVs and aircraft's core communication systems. Analyzing current solutions to each threat and incorporating early concepts for UAM, this paper then presents a basic cybersecurity framework featuring a blockchain-based PKI with secondary navigation systems to allow for the development of secure airspace.
Integrating deep reinforced learning and robotic process automation in blockchain digital transformation for autonomous cybersecurity.The term Blockchain Technology (BT) refers to information technology (IT) where data is stored in numerous blocks using multiple distributed servers. Through digital automation the data is refreshed periodically at a frequency set by data architects and network designers. The servers are sometimes on the public internet, but in the aerospace world it is more within private intranet of authorized users to maintain privacy and security. A Blockchain network registers the components within aerospace echo system in a digital ledger accompanied by relevant data. It is virtually immutable. The data residing within BT cannot be changed without the awareness of the collaborative parties. Even if a hacker manages to penetrate one block, the overall integrity of the data would remain intact since the data is distributed among thousands of blocks containing cryptographically protected digital ledgers. Deep reinforced learning (DRL) is a machine learning (ML) process based on reinforced learning (RL) and neural networks (NN). DRL training algorithms adjusts its actions dynamically motivated by a system of reward and punishment. The DRL algorithm learns by interacting with its dynamic environment. The DRL software agents receive rewards for correct actions and penalties for performing incorrectly. These agents learn without human intervention by targeting maximizing the reward and minimizing the penalty. Robotic process automation (RPA) is a business process automation technology based on software agents. It can trigger automated agent-based actions. When RPA and DRL are combined, system operates software agents that can learn in dynamic environment automatically without human interventions. They act as autonomous agents that learns continuously and operates cyber infrastructure autonomously. In this paper we show the implementation process and the benefits of integrating deep reinforced learning and robotic process automation in Blockchain digital transformation for autonomous cybersecurity.
A cybersecurity framework for aerospace services.As the FAA harmonizes to ICAO standards for aeronautical data and the NAS embraces a cloud infrastructure for collaborative decision making among airlines, air traffic facilities, airports, and industry, the move to streaming services and tapping into data flows needs to pay attention to privacy and cybersecurity. The opportunities for malware to be introduced needs to be actively combated at the instigation of services and continuously monitored. Known vulnerabilities in ADS-B spoofing and Chris Roberts-type interceptions of air-ground data are only the beginning of what is sure to be a growing industry as bad actors attempt to gain admission to US aerospace systems for data interception, malware, ransom, and technology theft. This paper describes the Robust Analytics Cybersecurity Framework (RACSF) and the components that can be employed to minimize the threats in the NAS.
Intelligent cyber defense in the 5g augmented aviation cybersecurity framework.The fifth-generation mobile network (5G) is replacing the 4G LTE hardware and communication infrastructure in connecting aviation echo system, infrastructure, and technologies.

Measuring the Influence of Methods to Raise the E-Awareness of Cybersecurity for Medina Region Employees.The use of computers has become inevitable for businesses, especially in the last decades. Whether in private or in public sectors, people have become extremely attached to the use of smart digital devices, such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc. However, the digitisation has made life easier and more comfortable, but this huge change in life has brought with it several challenges and raised the average of criminal activities known as cybercrimes. The observations showed that the main reason behind most people facing these crimes is the lack of awareness of cybersecurity and cybercrimes. This research sheds lights on cybersecurity and cybercrimes, measures the government’s e-awareness of cybersecurity, and identifies the types of most effective material in raising the e-awareness of cybersecurity and cybercrimes. The study has divided the data into different categories, in consistent with (age, gender, education, and ethic). The sample size was 243 staff. The age of the staff was divided into three different groups, in relation to their IT capabilities. The suggestion was that the primary age group target was between (20 and 35) years and then between (36 and 50) as well as (51 and 60) years. Every participant within the sample was exposed to cybersecurity e-awareness by using different tools. The study indicates that directing sources to provide Arabic content through videos or audio clips, they are more effective than other methods, thus contributing to saving resources from the loss in textual awareness. Also, there is poor e-awareness among employees form an Arab origin, while the non-Arab have a much better awareness. The most effect cybersecurity measure is to enhance the e-awareness, which affects the employees based on the employee’s level. Cybersecurity. E-awareness. E-listening. E-video. IT capability

A Single-Board Computing Constellation Supporting Integration of Hands-On Cybersecurity Laboratories into Operating Systems Courses.Integration of relevant hands-on cybersecurity content into laboratories supporting our required operating systems course helps to provide all computing students a baseline level of cybersecurity knowledge, even if those students never enroll in a dedicated cybersecurity course. However, these hands-on laboratories often require rebuilding of kernels, capturing network traffic, running offensive cybersecurity tools, so that they either require dedicated computer infrastructure, thus increasing the costs in budget-strapped higher education institutions or frequent administrative actions in case of shared infrastructure. To address this problem, we have developed a low-cost single-board computing constellation and support infrastructure as a cost-effective means of delivering both instruction in traditional operating systems topics and related cybersecurity concepts, such as two-factor authentication and isolation via virtualization. Use of physical infrastructure instead of virtualized laboratory infrastructure has several advantages. The computing constellation offers simplified configuration and management, flexibility, isolation, deployment of diverse laboratory assignments, and uniformity of user experience. The use of physical infrastructure built upon a low-cost single board computer makes the computing constellation scalable to address rising enrollments. This paper includes an overview of the security-focused laboratories added to the operating systems course, and the construction and operation of the computing constellation infrastructure so that other educators may replicate the infrastructure and integrate similar hands-on cybersecurity laboratories into their existing computing curriculum.

Experiences and Lessons Learned Creating and Validating Concept Inventories for Cybersecurity. We reflect on our ongoing journey in the educational Cybersecurity Assessment Tools (CATS) Project to create two concept inventories for cybersecurity. We identify key steps in this journey and important questions we faced. We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions, highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better. The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories—conceptual tests of understanding—that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity. the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background. Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts, uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding. Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We hope that our experiences and lessons learned may help others create more effective concept inventories and assessments in STEM. Computer science education. Concept inventories. Cryptography.

A data quality assessment model and its application to cybersecurity data sources.The proliferation of large storage systems such as data lake or big data implies that companies and public institutions need to evaluate the quality of the collected data, in order to ensure that the decisions that take are the most adequate. This fact implies to assess in some cases the own institution, or the data sources that provide the data. Current methods to evaluate data quality are primarily focused on traditional storage systems such as relational databases. In this work, we present a multidimensional data quality evaluation model. We propose a set of data quality dimensions and present an assessment methodology for each of them. The quality of each data source is computed by a mathematical formula that provides us a quality score that let us obtain a ranking of data sources. We also present a software tool that automatically performs the presented quality evaluation model. This tool is flexible enough to be adapted to different datastore systems. In particular, the model is applied over a real datastore of cybersecurity events with data collected from 27 different data sources. They have obtained quality values between −0.125 and 0.719.

Awareness of cybersecurity: Implications for learning for future citizens.In real life contexts, predicting how technology will actually be used is often difficult. This can be a problem in the context of cybercrime: attempts to steal our identities, our money, or simply to frustrate our work by infecting our computers, rely on exceptions, derogations, people not paying attention, or not understanding what is at stake. There are various ways for the criminal mind to operate, but our concern is that future users need to develop more awareness of cybersecurity, meaning not only knowing the risks of using technology, but also how to handle threats that may happen in cyberspace. We will report two qualitative studies that show that cybersecurity awareness is about evolving resilience in a collaborative practice, and therefore cybersecurity awareness is collaborative. This has implications for Technology Enhanced Learning for future citizens. Awareness. Cybersecurity. Learning 
Human-Machine Interaction for Improved Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition Considering Semantic Similarity.The automated and timely conversion or extraction of cybersecurity information from unstructured text from online sources is important and required for many applications. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used to detect the relevant domain entities such as product, attack name, malware name, hacker group name, etc. To train a new NER model for cybersecurity, traditional NER requires a training corpus annotated with cybersecurity entities and state-of-the-art methods require time-consuming and labor intensive feature engineering. We propose a Human-Machine Interaction method for semi-automatic labeling and corpus generation for cybersecurity entities. Our method evaluates the learned NER model with the sentences that we collected in the training process, and the user selects only the correct pair of the named entity and its category for next iteration training. Thus, each iteration gets better training corpora to train the NER model. Some entities are ambiguous since the word or phrase has multiple meanings. We introduce a new semantic similarity measure and determine which category the word belongs to based on this semantic similarity of the entire sentence. The experimental evaluation result shows that our method is better than existing methods in finding undiscovered keywords of given categories. Cybersecurity. Named Entity Recognition. NER.

OTG: A Gateway for Cybersecurity in the Context of OPC UA PubSub Pattern.Under the background of industrial intelligence, OPC UA PubSub mode is strongly supported by Industry 4.0 as a protocol designed to meet the communication requirements of industrial control level. With the gradual opening of industrial control network, the PubSub security model in OPC UA protocol alone cannot meet the new security requirements under the background of OT and IT integration. According to the specification, we analyze the possible threats, impacts and countermeasures that PubSub may face in OPC UA deployment environment, and emphasized that PubSub security model is difficult to protect resource-constrained industrial field equipment from the harm caused by DoS and other attacks. In view of the limited resources of industrial control network, this paper proposes that OTG gateway provides protection for PubSub service. Compared with traditional security gateway, OTG gateway can greatly reduce the consumption of industrial control network resources by network attacks. In addition, according to the characteristics of PubSub protocol, a DoS detection algorithm for this architecture is proposed. Compared with the traditional DoS detection algorithm, it has better applicability to PubSub protocol and can detect DoS attacks more accurately to reduce the impact on device performance. Experiments show that the DoS detection algorithm has 100% accuracy and 0.13% false positive rate, and can detect DoS attacks faster than the traditional detection algorithm.
Cyber security vulnerabilities of smart metering based on LPWAN wireless communication technologies.Smart Metering allows utilities to get a remote and instant reading of the electronic meters used for Electricity power consumption and water utilization. Despite all the advantages presented by the smart metering system, there are always some challenges to be faced, such as security and communication. Cyber-attacks not only may threaten the consumer's privacy but they can even lead to a compromised system with direct implications on people's safety and society activities. On the other hand, nodes Geo-location may also impose problems, when they are geographically dispersed and hard to reach from the usual cluster. The provisioning of such a large number of smart meters directly affects the operational cost expenditures. The same is true when there is not currently an appropriate communication infrastructure. Wireless technology offers an easier, faster, and cost-effective approach. To discuss and answer the above challenges, Low Power Wide area networks (LPWAN) technologies are considered, with special focus on Long Range/Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRa/LoRaWAN) technology which facilitates long-range wireless, as they seem promising to anticipate for many of the recognized problems. Accordingly, for building such a reliable LPWAN-based smart metering infrastructure, applicability, feasibility, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities have to be examined using the existing literature. 6LoWPAN.

A Study on the Application of Technical Assessment Methodology (TAM) for CyberSecurity in Nuclear Power Plant. Recently 1, cyber attacks targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been increasing rapidly. accordingly, cyber security applications and security evaluations of ICS are becoming very important. Technical Assessment Methodology (TAM) is a method developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the United States for assessing and applying security control methods for power plants. By applying TAM, limitations of cyber security application and security evaluation of existing nuclear facilities are able to address. In this study, a virtual test bed was composed for one of the safety systems of APR1400, and the TAM was applied and analyzed to derive two advantages and five features of TAM. Based on this, the rationale for using TAM for the application and assessment of security control methods in nuclear facilities was explained, including five considerations for the better application of TAM. Finally, we propose future work for applying TAM. cybersecurity assessment. nuclear power plant. technical assessment methodology 
A Comparative Study of Deep Learning based Named Entity Recognition Algorithms for Cybersecurity. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is important in the cybersecurity domain. It helps researchers extract cyber threat information from unstructured text sources. The extracted cyber-entities or key expressions can be used to model a cyber-attack described in an open-source text. A large number of general-purpose NER algorithms have been published that work well in text analysis. These algorithms do not perform well when applied to the cybersecurity domain. In the field of cybersecurity, the open-source text available varies greatly in complexity and under-lying structure of the sentences. General-purpose NER algorithms can misrepresent domain-specific words, such as  malicious and  javascript . In this paper, we compare the recent deep learning-based NER algorithms on a cybersecurity dataset. We created a cybersecurity dataset collected from various sources, including  Microsoft Security Bulletin and  Adobe Security Updates . Some of these approaches proposed in literature were not used for Cybersecurity. Others are innovations proposed by us. This comparative study helps us identify the NER algorithms that are robust and can work well in sentences taken from a large number of cybersecurity sources. We tabulate their performance on the test set and identify the best NER algorithm for a cybersecurity corpus. We also discuss the different embedding strategies that aid in the process of NER for the chosen deep learning algorithms. Artificial Intelligence. Cybersecurity. Deep Learning.

Resolving the cybersecurity Data Sharing Paradox to scale up cybersecurity via a co-production approach towards data sharing.As cybercriminals scale up their operations to increase their profits or inflict greater harm, we argue that there is an equal need to respond to their threats by scaling up cyber-security. To achieve this goal, we have to develop a co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising co-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon. We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and standardised in order to mitigate the paradox.

Co-Simulating Physical Processes and Network Data for High-Fidelity Cyber-Security Experiments.Recently, Digital Twin-based solutions have been proposed as experimentation platforms to study the behaviour of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) under attack, and design appropriate detection and mitigation measures. Existing solutions focus on physical process, control logic, or network communication simulation. Unfortunately, none of the Digital Twin solutions currently available provide arealistic and holistic solution to represent all three aspects. In this work, we propose the Digital HydrAuLic SIMulator (DHALSIM), a Digital Twin for water distribution systems that simulates physical, control, and network processes. DHALSIM builds on the integration of the Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR) hydraulic simulator and MiniCPS - an industrial network emulator - which are run in a co-simulation environment. Thanks to this integration, DHALSIM is able to simulate the hydraulic processes characterizing a water distribution system as well as full stack emulation of well-known industrial control protocols. The Digital Twin is demonstrated on the benchmark case study of C-Town, where we carry out a number of cyber-attack experiments. To our knowledge, DHALSIM is the first Digital Twin that implements a well known physics simulator with a virtual industrial logic and network emulation environment for water systems. DHALSIM is open source and available to the research community.
Exploring the relationship between collaborative discourse, programming actions, and cybersecurity and computational thinking knowledge. Computational thinking (CT) skills are necessary for solving the real-world problems of today and are therefore being incorporated into K-12 curricula. Cybersecurity is of similar importance. however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work. Collaboration. Computational thinking. Cybersecurity. Educational robotics.

Practice-oriented smartphone security exercises for developing cybersecurity mindset in high school students.Advancements in technology and the increase in Internet usage through mobile devices have led to greater visibility of organizations and individuals to cybercrimes. Teenagers being easy targets of these cybercrimes, there is a need to educate them on cybersecurity trends since training students on existing cyberattacks is viewed as a powerful tool to teach cybersecurity. We present a pedagogical approach to train students to identify new threats and respond to mitigate them. This is accomplished through observatory, experiential, and real-life practice-oriented cybersecurity exercises. Seven malicious android applications targeting malware class and phishing, namely Email-Lite-Scare, Shop-Shock-Struck, CyberSafe Practices, Play-Read-Disrupt, Fish-A-Phish, Chat-Phish, and Spy-The-Trojan, have been developed. Psychological learning is emphasized in this approach by exercising the application extensively. The underlying goals of this work are to develop a security mindset, spread awareness on threats associated with smartphone/tablet usage, and to inculcate interest in cybersecurity careers among high school students.

A Census of Swedish Government Administrative Authority Employee Communications on Cybersecurity during the COVID-19 Pandemic.Cybersecurity is the backbone of a successful digitalization of society, and cyber situation awareness is an essential aspect of managing it. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up an already ongoing digitalization of Swedish government agencies, but the cybersecurity maturity level varies across agencies. In this study, we conduct a census of Swedish government administrative authority communications on cybersecurity to employees at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The census shows that the employee communications in the beginning of the pandemic to a greater extent have focused on first-order risks, such as video meetings and telecommuting, rather than on second-order risks, such as invoice fraud or social engineering. We also find that almost two thirds of the administrative authorities have not yet implemented, but only initiated or documented, their cybersecurity policies. COVID-19.

A review of various challenges in cybersecurity using artificial intelligence.Cybersecurity using Artificial Intelligence is a double-edged sword, it can improve security substantially but it also creates a possibility of new forms of attack, which performed on Artificial Intelligence itself. Machine Learning algorithms are proved useful at identifying zero-day attacks or detecting an unusual behavior of systems that might indicate an attack or a malware. This research work has reviewed various security threats and defensive techniques, open challenges in cybersecurity domain for intrusion detection, malware detection and network anomaly detection systems using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. It is found that most of the discussed approaches used supervised models. For intrusion detection, RBF-SVM (Radial Basis Function-Support Vector Machine) model gave highest accuracy of 99.90% while in malware detection DNN (Deep Neural Network) model gave 97.79% accuracy. For pirated software identification, a DNN model was used and it gave 96% accuracy. Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model worked best for network anomaly detection giving an accuracy of 99.90%. On the other hand, for anomaly detection a DBN (Deep Belief Networks) based model is used which gives 69.77% accuracy. Finally, this paper discusses about the 5G's security, cyber-attacks and the major role of the above emerging fields in the future of cybersecurity. Artificial Intelligence. Cybersecurity.

The Use of Runtime Verification for Identifying and Responding to Cybersecurity Threats Posed to State Actors during Cyberwarfare.This paper considers the utility of the use of runtime verification techniques for detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats. To this end, it considers two questions: First, it evaluates the efficacy of runtime verification for identifying zero-day threats and threats that are not otherwise widely known based up system operations. Second, it considers the particular use of these techniques by state actors (i.e., nation states engaged in declared or undeclared cyberwarfare) who are likely to encounter a greater level of such vulnerability exploits than individuals or private businesses during the normal operations. Drawing on the analysis in the two foregoing areas, the paper concludes by identifying key areas of needed future work to support runtime verification's application in this area. cyberattacks. cybersecurity. cyberwarfare. runtime verification. threats 
A Survey of Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity.During the last decades, not only the number of cyberattacks have increased significantly, they have also become more sophisticated. Hence designing a cyber-resilient approach is of paramount importance. Traditional security methods are not adequate to prevent data breaches in case of cyberattacks. Cybercriminals have learned how to use new techniques and robust tools to hack, attack, and breach data. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been introduced into cyberspace to construct smart models for defending systems from attacks. Since AI technologies can rapidly evolve to address complex situations, they can be used as fundamental tools in the field of cybersecurity. Al-based techniques can provide efficient and powerful cyber defense tools to recognize malware attacks, network intrusions, phishing and spam emails, and data breaches, to name a few, and to alert security incidents when they occur. In this paper, we review the impact of AI in cybersecurity and summarize existing research in terms of benefits of AI in cybersecurity. artificial intelligence. bio-inspired computing. cognitive science. component: cybersecurity. deep learning. machine learning

Quantitatively Examining Service Requests of a Cloud-Based On-Demand Cybersecurity Service Solution for Small Businesses.With the rise of cybercrimes, limited by the funding and in-house technical resource, the small business sector is already known for struggling with cybersecurity-related issues. Regardless of 65% acknowledging they have been the target of a cyberattack and 86% believing digital risk will upsurge, only 4% of small and medium-sized business owners have executed all of the U.S. Small Business Administration's cybersecurity best practices, rendering to a survey by Nationwide [1]. To meet this challenge, we have proposed a cloud-based on-demand cybersecurity service solution for small businesses (CODCSSSB) to provide a cost-effective cybersecurity resolution for small businesses. This paper has explored how to apply a quantitative examination approach to validate the security service requests sent to and processed by the CODCSSSB to discover the weakness of design with low cost in terms of the time of development and accuracy of identifying the root cause of the design issues. cloud computing. cost-effective. cybersecurity. risk management. small business 
OctoBot: Human Activity Orchestration System for Cybersecurity Experiment and Exercise.Cybersecurity experiment and exercise in a testbed environment required normal traffic to ensure a better result, a learning experience, and the effectiveness of the whole process. The traffic camouflages the attack traffic from the attacker by generating different types of activities and tasks that are usually generated by the human. Unfortunately, in a large-scale experiment and exercise, it is impractical to employ a large number of humans to generate normal traffic. There are several methods available to produce a single human activity from an agent, but automating it from multiple agents with multiple and different activities is very challenging. By learning and adopting the concept of BotNet, we designed an orchestration system for a human agent (i.e., bot), called OctoBot, to generate human activity that is easy to be deployed and utilized. This paper discusses primary considerations in designing and implementing our system with an example of unique bot development. It also presents deployment experience in the production testbed environment with an example use case for a virtual environment to show the potential usability of our system. Activity generation.

Optimizing Cyber Security Education: Implementation of Bloom's Taxonomy for future Cyber Security workforce.This research paper determines how education can be optimized by mapping curricula onto Bloom's taxonomy. The cyber security industry has disparate ways of recruiting its workforce owing to the prevailing educational system and diverse work roles in the field of cyber security. Comparison is drawn between the old and revised models of Bloom's taxonomy to depict which model best represents the dynamic learning objectives and outcomes of cyber security education. A rubric is designed from the Dreyfus et al model of skill acquisition based on the iterations of Bloom's taxonomy to assess cyber security competencies to achieve mastery. To bridge the skills gaps in the industry, Bloom's taxonomy provides the impetus to align the needs of industry with educational programs [1]. Bloom's taxonomy. cyber security. education.

A Cyber-Security Strategy for Internationally-dispersed Industrial Networks.Globalization implies geographically dispersed supply chains composed of facilities strategically located in several countries and regions of the world. These structures commonly involve several Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) infrastructures and integration to enable accurate and useful information processing. Such integration (also called Cyber-Physical Systems) transforms the industry and facilitates massive data volumes' systematic transformation into valuable information. Security risks posed by such integration may be substantial and, depending on the size of the company, and the number of integration points, dealing with them could easily cost millions of dollars. With the main objective of studying available strategies to manage security risks in companies with dispersed supply chains, this paper reviews international cyber-security standards and regulations and proposes a more comprehensive strategy. The strategy includes IT services, optimized perimeter segregation, and data flow policies among OT and IT networks to balance a high level of protection and cost-effectiveness.

Cyber Security Protocol for Secure Traffic Monitoring Systems using PUF-based Key Management. Real-Time Traffic monitoring systems need to monitor the vehicles as well as it requires to communicate with the vehicle to provide the real time information about traffic density, road construction, etc. However, insecure communication between these entities can lead to life-Threatening scenarios. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop appropriate protocols facilitating communication between vehicles to vehicles and vehicles to the traffic monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose a new AEAD-based protocol embedded with physically Unclonable Function (PUF) based key generation for secure and authenticated transmission of videos for real-Time monitoring systems. The proposed protocol consists of a lightweight AEAD primitive-ACORN. and a hardware-efficient LFSR-based Ring Oscillator PUF (RO-PUF). The proposed PUF based key generation adds another layer of security to our protocol. Our protocol is implemented in FPGA using a 640\times 480 resolution camera with 30 frames per second. Detailed implementation study of the entire protocol shows its feasibility for real-world usage. Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD). Autonomous vehicles.

What are they Reporting? Examining Student Cybersecurity Course Surveys through the Lens of Machine Learning.This paper examines IRB-approved student surveys across five cybersecurity and digital forensics courses during Spring 2020 for the benefit of continual course improvement for regulatory requirements such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) (re)accreditation. There is very little research on qualitative machine-learning based methods for the analysis of student feedback in cybersecurity courses, if any courses. This research fills the literature gap by analyzing the feedback from 114 open-ended surveys across five cybersecurity and digital forensic courses to categorize areas of course improvement. To gain insights into the qualitative survey feedback, we employed term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a K-Means clustering algorithm on cleaned and pre-processed survey data. This methodology provides more useful insights for curriculum developers than a standard sentiment analysis. The methodology can be further extended to be directly integrated into continual course improvement (e.g. ABET, NSA, DoD, etc.) indicators.

The Cyber Security of Battery Energy Storage Systems and Adoption of Data-driven Methods.Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are becoming a crucial part of electric grids due to their important roles in renewable energy sources (RES) integration in energy systems. Cyber-secure operation of BESS in renewable energy systems is significant, since it is susceptible to cyber threats and its potential failure may result in economical and physical damage to both the BESS and the system. However, there is a lack of comprehensive study on the attack detection methods for industrial BESSs. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art work in the area of BESS cyber threats, investigates how to detect cyberattackes in the operation stage. We address the problem of enhancing the communication channels' integrity can by implementing blockchain in the design stage of BESS, combined with applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for false data injection attack (FDIA) detection in the BESS operation stage. The focus is on the application of ML and AI methods for FDIA detection on different system layers. Based on our analysis, data-driven approaches such as clustering and artificial-neutral-network-based state estimation (SE) forecast are recommended for the implementation in BESSs. artificial intelligence. battery energy storage system. battery state estimation. cyber security. cyber threat. cyberattack. false data injection attack. machine learning. renewable energy source

This paper focuses on the Network Monitoring and Visualization Application (NMVA) component and the animated commentator component. It also discusses how the two components interoperate. The role of NMVA is to monitor critical services and attacks on blue team networks. NMVA consists of five component types: Components for monitoring network traffic, components for reporting various network messages, data storage components and a visualization component. The animated commentator component aims to engage the audience/spectators using a video game like approach. Animated Commentator. Cybersecurity Competition. Visualization Application 
A Systematic Study of AI Applications in Cybersecurity Competitions.With more and more advanced persistent threats and other advanced attacks emerging, the cybersecurity situation becomes complicated and grim. Owing to its unique advantages, artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in cybersecurity and playing an increasingly important role. However, cybersecurity talents, especially those with AI skills (defined as AISec talents) are in short supply, and talents cultivation becomes a top priority. Cybersecurity competition is one of the most effective ways to identify talents. In order to reduce the gap between supply and demand of AISec talents, we investigate the existing cybersecurity competitions concerning AI applications in the paper. We summarize several existing forms of competing in cybersecurity competitions and discuss the ways AI impacts on cybersecurity. Based on the work of above, AI competitions in categories and how AI is applied in competitions are illustrated in detail. By analyzing and summarizing, we reveal the current problems and point out the direction for future competitions to better serve in talents cultivation and selection.

Enhancing cyber security using audio techniques: A public key infrastructure for sound.This paper details the research into using audio signal processing methods to provide authentication and identification services for the purpose of enhancing cyber security in voice applications. Audio is a growing domain for cyber security technology. It is envisaged that over the next decade, the primary interface for issuing commands to consumer internet-enabled devices will be voice. Increasingly, devices such as desktop computers, smart speakers, cars, TV's, phones an Internet of Things (IOT) devices all have built in voice assistants and voice activated features. This research outlines an approach to securely identify and authenticate users of audio and voice operated systems that utilises existing cryptography methods and audio steganography in a method comparable to a PKI for sound, whilst retaining the usability associated with audio and voice driven systems.

Optimal Cybersecurity Investments for SIS Model.We study the problem of minimizing the (time) average security costs in large systems comprising many interdependent subsystems, where the state evolution is captured by a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. The security costs reflect security investments, economic losses and recovery costs from infections and failures following successful attacks. We show that the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and propose two algorithms - one for solving a convex relaxation, and the other for finding a local minimizer, based on a reduced gradient method. Also, we provide a sufficient condition under which the convex relaxation is exact and its solution coincides with that of the original problem. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Cybersecurity investments. Optimization. SIS model 
Cybersecurity in Medical Private Practice: Results of a Survey in Audiology.Despite well-documented cyber threats to patients' protected health information (PHI), sparse evidence exists about the state of cybersecurity behavior of health care workers and medical private practices. There is evidence of insecure behavior in hospital settings, even though specific insights about private practice are still absent. In addition to mandatory standards for securing PHI, such as the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA), small business viability and their patients' security and privacy are critically dependent upon technology availability and reliability. In this survey of 131 clinical audiologists we show that many lack time, staff expertise, or funds to deploy adequate cybersecurity that prevents and mitigates threats to security and privacy. We find widespread deployment of HIPAA-compliant cybersecurity, including antivirus software and individual logins. Only 9.9% of participants reported at least one data breach in 2019, significantly less than the average for small businesses and health care providers, and only 24.4% reported having cyber insurance. Practice owners view patient data as well protected and unlikely victims for cyber attacks and breaches. These results have important implications for cybersecurity products and services, and to medical professionals who must acknowledge the acute importance of cybersecurity in securing protected health information and mitigating risks. Small business private practice health care providers who are particularly sensitive to the impacts of cyber attacks and must prioritize and adopt countermeasures that decrease the risks to patients and their own businesses. cybersecurity. health care. private practice. small business 
Assessing the provision of public-facing cybersecurity guidance for end-users.The increased use of digital technologies and services brings with it a similarly increasing requirement for their end-users to have the awareness and ability to protect the security and privacy of their devices and data. However, this raises the related questions of what they need to know and from where they may obtain related guidance. The discussion begins by considering the knowledge and skills that could usefully characterize a cybersecurity literate user. The paper then proceeds to examine the provision of end-user guidance from 17 public-facing sources, spanning national sources, operating system provides, training providers and popular online services. The findings illustrate that, while some topics are commonly covered, none of them are found to be uniformly addressed across all sources. As such, the level of awareness that users may have, and the level of good practice that they may follow, is likely to be highly dependent upon where they have looked for guidance. This points toward the need for a consistent and more harmonized approach if we wish to ensure that a common baseline of cybersecurity literacy can be achieved across an increasingly digital society.

Malicious Design in AIVR, Falsehood and Cybersecurity-oriented Immersive Defenses.Advancements in the AI field unfold tremendous opportunities for society. Simultaneously, it becomes increasingly important to address emerging ramifications. Thereby, the focus is often set on ethical and safe design forestalling unintentional failures. However, cybersecurity-oriented approaches to AI safety additionally consider instantiations of intentional malice - including unethical malevolent AI design. Recently, an analogous emphasis on malicious actors has been expressed regarding security and safety for virtual reality (VR). In this vein, while the intersection of AI and VR (AIVR) offers a wide array of beneficial cross-fertilization possibilities, it is responsible to anticipate future malicious AIVR design from the onset on given the potential socio-psycho-technological impacts. For a simplified illustration, this paper analyzes the conceivable use case of Generative AI (here deepfake techniques) utilized for disinformation in immersive journalism. In our view, defenses against such future AIVR safety risks related to falsehood in immersive settings should be transdisciplinarily conceived from an immersive co-creation stance. As a first step, we motivate a cybersecurity-oriented procedure to generate defenses via immersive design fictions. Overall, there may be no panacea but updatable transdisciplinary tools including AIVR itself could be used to incrementally defend against malicious actors in AIVR. AI. AI Safety. Cybersecurity.

Exploring cyber security measures in smart cities.Technologies which enhance the quality of everyday lifestyle are increasing rapidly. During their initial development, Internet and network-based services were not built by taking cyber security measures into consideration. The cost of this is still being paid to this day. Nowadays, there are certainly clear need for cyber security requirements for almost all Internet and network-based systems. Several kinds of such systems are normally connected together in unprecedented ways in smart cities. This in fact will complicate the security requirements that should be considered when building smart cities. Yet, the studies on security requirements in smart cities remain to be one of the fields that needs further exploration. This article explores the essential cyber security requirements in smart cities by considering various previous research studies in the field. On top of that, several other recommended security requirements will be introduced as a response to the gaps that continues to be predominating the field. Cloud Computing. Cybersecurity. IoT.

A bayesian network model for machine learning and cyber security. The phenomenal growth in the use of internet-based technologies has resulted in complexities in cyber security subjecting organizations to cyber-attacks. This research is purposed to develop a cyber-security system that uses the Bayesian Network structure and Machine Learning. The research determined the cyber-security framework appropriate for a developing nation. evaluated network detection and prevention systems that use Artificial Intelligence paradigms such as finite automata, neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, or diverse data-mining-based approaches. analyzed Bayesian Networks that can be represented as graphical models and are directional to represent cause-effect relationships. and developed a Bayesian Network model that can handle complexity in cybersecurity. The Pragmatism paradigm used in this research, as a philosophy is intricately related to the mixed-method approach, which is largely quantitative with the research design being a survey and an experiment, but supported by qualitative approaches where Focus Group discussions were held. The Artificial Intelligence paradigms evaluated include machine learning methods, autonomous robotic vehicles, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic.

Introducing a Mobile App to Increase Cybersecurity Awareness in MENA.Cybersecurity experts predict that cybersecurity is going to be the new cold war. Arab countries are exposed to cyber-attacks that are aimed at stealing personal data and trade secrets. Furthermore, statistics show that women in such countries are exposed to different forms of cyber violence. This paper introduces a new mobile app in the Arabic language to educate Arab-speaking people in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) about cybersecurity and to increase their awareness of information assurance and cybercrimes. The app was developed for Android and iOS devices and it includes multiple-choice information assurance questions, terms, and articles. Examples of the term definitions are Two-Factor Authentication, Ethical Hacking, and Honeypot. The app data could be increased in the next update of the app. cybersecurity. educational app. mobile app 
Employees' Cybersecurity Behaviour in the Mobile Context: The Role of Self-Efficacy and Psychological Ownership.Mobile devices are widely known to be a cybersecurity risk for organisations. However, their use for work purposes is largely becoming a common practice as most organisations rather prefer to find security countermeasures than miss out on the momentous benefits they provide. Since the weakest link in cybersecurity is the human element, organisations are increasingly looking for ways to upskill their employees so that they can be able to implement the necessary security safeguards. Yet, a concerning trend is that even individuals with a high-security self-efficacy sometimes fail to take the needed security actions. To better understand why this occurs, the present study proposes and validates psychological ownership as a possible boundary condition for explaining the security self-efficacy to security behaviour nexus in the mobile security context. Using an online survey with 214 respondents, this study showed that both the direct and indirect effects of security self-efficacy on mobile device security behaviour were moderated by psychological ownership such that the effects were more pronounced when psychological ownership was high than when it was low. The paper culminates with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice. cybersecurity behaviour. employees. mobile security. psychological ownership. self-efficacy 
Combining Ideas and Artifacts: An Interaction-Focused View on Computing Education Using a Cybersecurity Example.In this paper, we present a novel approach to design teaching interventions for computing education, elaborated using an example of cybersecurity education. Cybersecurity education, similar to other computing education domains, often focuses on one aspect and separate themselves from the other approach. In other words, they focus on one of the two different aspects: a) either teaching how to use and to behave, or b) how technology works. Here we suggest another point of focal awareness for teaching-interaction-that allows the recombination of both approaches in a novel way, leading to a reconstruction of the teaching and learning content in a way that-as we hope-supports an understanding on a higher level and thus gives the chance to better develop agency. For this didactic reconstruction of teaching content, we use an approach called the hybrid interaction system framework. In cybersecurity training, teaching interventions oftentimes are in a way successful but seem to not lead to long-lasting changes towards secure behavior. Using simply password security as an example, we show how this new approach recombines the two different priory mentioned teaching approaches in a novel way. Within this short paper, we present our current research progress, discuss potentials and values of the approach in general, and by way of example. Our intention of this submission and early disclosure is to spark discussion and generate further insights especially regarding the following question: What implications does the hybrid interaction system approach have on learning scenarios? .

What Brings Women to Cybersecurity?: A Qualitative Study of Women's Pathways to Cybersecurity in Norway. The proportion of women in information technology (IT) work is low, however, the growing fieldof cybersecurity attracts even fewer women. This paper reports from a study exploring what motivates women to enter IT in general and cybersecurity in particular, with the aim of developing strategies to recruit women to these fields. The analysis builds on in-depth interviews with 24 female students and researchers at universities, 12 in cybersecurity and 12 in other IT disciplines. There aresome similarities between the two groups, like the lack of knowledge about any IT disciplines, leaving gender stereotypes to lead their images of IT. There are also differences: a wider set of interests and disciplines motivate women to choose cybersecurity. The women find it easier to identify with cybersecurity, seeing it as a field concerning  everybody , different from core fields of IT. IT is still an important gateway and gender stereotypes about IT are a challenge for recruiting women to IT as well as cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. Gender. IT Education. Recruitment. Women 
AIT Cyber Range: Flexible Cyber Security Environment for Exercises, Training and Research.With the evolution of threats and attacks and the speed of automation, new modern training and learning environments are needed to support the challenges of digital organizations and societies. In recent years, cyber ranges, i.e., virtual environments that support the simulation of diverse infrastructures, have emerged and are often utilized for cyber security exercises or training. With these environments, organizations or individuals can increase their preparedness and dexterity, forexample, by training to identify and mitigate incidents and attacks. In this paper, we present the AIT Cyber Range which was designed based on several principles such as scalability, flexibility andthe utilization of Open Source technologies. This paper outlines the building blocks of the architecture and implementation: computing platform, infrastructure provisioning, software provisioning and scenario engine. Furthermore, the implementation is demonstrated by three use cases: cyber exercises, training as well as security research and development. For future work, we aim to further extend the building blocks and to address federation and interoperability with other cyber ranges. cyber exercises. cyber range. information security. testbed. training 
Cybersecurity as Information Retrieval Dimension for Cloud-based Edge-powered IoT Search.The Internet of Things is a novel and promising paradigm already being part of some of our daily activities. At the end of this year, the Internet will connect about 7 billion smart things. They are part of solutions ranging from Smart Cities to telemetry collection for Industrial applications generating a colossal amount of real-time streaming data. Cloud-based services have also being evolved from pure IaaS providing Virtual Machines to sophisticated PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS designed explicitly for Big Data, Analytics and IoT, they all exhibiting serverless architectures. Moreover, Information Retrieval (IR) is becoming a crucial application layer on top of IoT application for searching and retrieving relevant data on the real-time streaming collections, on sensors, or things. In the last years, a significant set of approaches have been explored IoT, Big Data, and IoT Search Engines. However, the cybersecurity has not been meticulously researched. Neither for IoT nor IR, as a critical component at searching on the IoT. In this paper, we present an approach to consider cybersecurity as an IR dimension for cloud-based edge-powered searching over IoT from a theoretical perspective, we compare through a compact survey the related works and finalise with a multi-perspective discussion to embrace cybersecurity in the IoT/IoTSE architectures.

Review: Deep Learning Methods for Cybersecurity and Intrusion Detection Systems.As the number of cyber-attacks is increasing, cyber-security is evolving to a key concern for any business. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) (in particular Deep Learning - DL) can be leveraged as key enabling technologies for cyber-defense, since they can contribute in threat detection and can even provide recommended actions to cyber analysts. A partnership of industry, academia, and government on a global scale is necessary in order to advance the adoption of AI/ML to cybersecurity and create efficient cyber defense systems. In this paper, we are concerned with the investigation of the various deep learning techniques employed for network intrusion detection and we introduce a DL framework for cybersecurity applications.

Probabilistic Modeling and Study of Cybersecurity Attacks in Industrial Control Systems of Plants.Cybersecurity attacks on plant industrial control systems (ICS) have been on the rise. In this paper, we review plant vulnerabilities, plant cyberattacks, and security controls. We also develop and evaluate a probabilistic model for cybersecurity attacks to plant ICS with five possible attacks, three cybersecurity defense strengths, and six cybersecurity defense scenarios. A model of the overhead costs of the six cyberattacks is also presented. We then evaluate the probability of success of these six modeled attacks, particularly under the six defense scenarios. This model helps in assessing the effectiveness of cybersecurity defenses facing a variety of plant cyberattacks and can be customized for different plant situations. Our results indicate that investing in securing the lower ICS network hierarchy levels is more effective than securing the higher levels including the enterprise network level. attack cost. cybersecurity. plant industrial control systems.

Surveillance Platform of cybersecurity maturity of micro and small enterprises.Cyberattacks are malicious and sophisticated events that attempt to exploit the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability of organizations, causing financial losses and reputational damage, among others. In general, the number of threats and their complexity increases every day as well as the digital transformation of organizations. While it is necessary for each company to increase its digital index, it is also necessary to increase its maturity in cybersecurity. Micro and small enterprises represent a large percentage of companies in Chile, which do not always have the capital to hire qualified cybersecurity personnel therefore, this bridge project between the Academy and the Industry, seeks to provide tools so that micro and small companies can evaluate themselves, and potentially have the accompaniment for continuous improvement and ultimately to mature digitally using a successful proposal of the study of different cybersecurity maturity modelels reviewed in the literature. cybersecurity. cybersecurity maturity model

An attack-trace generating toolchain for cybersecurity study of IEC61850 based substations.The digitisation of modern power grid substations allows them to better support various advanced operations. However, it also poses greater risk of cyber-related attacks. There is an array of cybersecurity solutions (e.g., intrusion detection systems) available in the market to prevent, detect, or respond to cyberattacks. This calls for the creation of datasets and test cases for the validation of those cybersecurity solutions. In our recent work, we have generated a synthesized dataset for testing of cybersecurity solutions of IEC 61850 based substations. Our dataset contained traces for some typical attack-free disturbance scenarios and cyberattack scenarios in a substation. In this work, we present the toolchain we have developed to allow easy generation of such traces. We discuss the design considerations behind our toolchain and provide step-by-step guide to potential users on how to create customized trace files for specific scenarios using our toolchain. By open-sourcing the project for the broad community, we hope our toolchain will enrich the body of testing datasets for substation cyber security solutions.
Robot technological system of analysis of cybersecurity information systems and communication networks.The article presents the authors' views on the organization of the modern system of cybersecurity. We considered the tasks, assigned to the monitoring subsystem and reconnaissance of cyberspace as a source of preventive hardware and software effects on the opposing side. The shortcomings of the existing structures of such subsystems are analyzed and the requirements to the intelligent automated system of cybersecurity are specified. The article offers hardware and software solutions, based on the development of a mobile robotic system for audit the stability of the network infrastructure and applications to existing and future cyber threats. A variant of the functional scheme of a robotic system with a universal housing is presented and with a set of mechanical drives, depending on the characteristics of the problems to be solved. For providing high functional flexibility and speed of the robotic system it is proposed to use fuzzy neural networks. The union of two independent theories-neural networks and fuzzy logic-Allowed creating neural-fuzzy systems, having a high level of intelligence and independence in decision-making. The advantage of hybrid neural-fuzzy technology of modeling and information processing is the ability to view the generated rules and giving them a meaningful linguistic interpretation. A reasonable conclusion is made, that is the main meaning of that is the main meaning of the shift of creation concepts and using of artificial intelligence-Transition from individual systems to distributed information processing and the development of multi-Agent intelligent systems.
The impact of cybersecurity on siting distributed generation units in AC power systems.The vulnerabilities of the smart grid to cyberattacks can pose dangerous threats to the assets connected to the power network. It is important to identify cyber vulnerabilities in power systems and implement effective defense mechanisms to prevent cyber threats on these assets. Existing research works have not shown effective techniques for the vulnerability assessment and countermeasures against cyberattacks for the AC power systems. In this paper, we emphasize the impact of cybersecurity on siting distributed generation (DG) units in the AC power grid. We present an AC-based false data injection (FDI) attack model to analyze the cyber vulnerabilities of the system and propose an optimal defense strategy to prevent cyber incidents on these units. We perform experiments on the SaskPower network of Saskatchewan, Canada, to demonstrate the optimal siting for DG units under the cybersecurity constraint. Our simulation results obtained for the SaskPower grid show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches to analyze the cyber vulnerabilities of the power grid and find secure sites for the DG units in Saskatchewan.

Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Augmentation and Embedding Improvement - A Healthcare Usecase.The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in medical environments, has introduced a growing list of security vulnerabilities and threats. The lack of an extensible big data resource that captures medical device vulnerabilities limits the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber defense systems in capturing, detecting, and preventing known and future attacks. We describe a system that generates a repository of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) about various medical devices and their known vulnerabilities from sources such as manufacturer and ICS-CERT vulnerability alerts. We augment the intelligence repository with data sources such as Wikidata and public medical databases. The combined resources are integrated with threat intelligence in our Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG) from previous research. The augmented graph embeddings are useful in querying relevant information and can help in various AI assisted cybersecurity tasks. Given the integration of multiple resources, we found the augmented CKG produced higher quality graph representations. The augmented CKG produced a 31% increase in the Mean Average Precision (MAP) value, computed over an information retrieval task. Artificial Intelligence. Cyber Threat Intelligence. Cybersecurity.

From Word Embedding to Cyber-Phrase Embedding: Comparison of Processing Cybersecurity Texts.Much of the vital information about emerging threats and the corresponding defensive measures are contained in large volumes of natural language texts online. Capturing such actionable intelligence in real-time is critical to prevent large scale attacks automatically. The ATTCK framework is a widely recognized standard to catalog technical details of cyber threats and deploy mitigating measures. A technique in ATTCK specifies a set of adversary actions to achieve a particular goal, such as Exfiltration over Command and Control channel. Details of the technique include encrypted traffic and encoded data. A key challenge in identifying such cyber intelligence from natural language texts is that for a given action, such as encrypted traffic, many alternative expressions are possible (e.g., send using a self-signed certificate, send using HTTPS requests). It is not practical to manually provide an exhaustive list of all such variants. We demonstrate that using cyber-phrase embedding on a cybersecurity text corpus is a promising approach to overcome such difficulties. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing models. We have created an open-source project to make our tools and data available for the cybersecurity research community.

A Data Mining Framework to Predict Cyber Attack for Cyber Security.Cyber-attacks are exponentially increasing daily with the advancements of technology. Therefore, the detection and prediction of cyber-attacks are very important for every organization that is dealing with sensitive data for business purposes. In this paper, we present a framework on cyber security using a data mining technique to predict cyber-attacks that can be helpful to take proper interventions to reduce the cyber-attacks. The two main components of the framework are the detection and prediction of cyber-attacks. The framework first extracts the patterns related to cyber-attacks from historical data using a J48 decision tree algorithm and then builds a prediction model to predict the future cyber-attacks. We then apply the framework on publicly available cyber security datasets provided by the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity. In the datasets, several kinds of cyber-attacks are presented including DDoS, Port Scan, Bot, Brute force, SQL Injection, and Heartbleed. The proposed framework correctly detects the cyber-attacks and provides the patterns related to cyber-attacks. The overall accuracy of the proposed prediction model to detect cyber-attacks is around 99%. The extracted patterns of the prediction model on historical data can be applied to predict any future cyber-attacks. The experimental results of the prediction model indicate the superiority of the model to detect any future cyber-attacks. Accuracy. Cyber Attack. Cyber Attack Prediction. Cyber Security.

The Cybersecurity Dynamics Way of Thinking and Landscape.The Cybersecurity Dynamics framework offers an approach to systematically understanding, characterizing, quantifying and managing cybersecurity from a holistic perspective. The framework looks into cyberspace through the dynamics lens because environments in cyberspace often evolve with time (e.g., software vulnerabilities, attack capabilities, defense capabilities, and cybersecurity states). The dynamics lens offers a unique viewpoint, which guides the modeling of the various situations which evolve with respect to cybersecurity. This type of evolution is driven by attackers, defenders, and users of related systems and is manifested by their attack/defense/use activities. Since its inception in 2014, there has been significant progress in characterizing and taming various kinds of cybersecurity dynamics. In this paper we discuss the landscape and way-of-Thinking that guide the Cybersecurity Dynamics model, including two killer applications and the technical barriers that serve as outstanding open problems for future research. cyber defense decision-making. cyber defense ooda loop. cyber defense orchestration. cybersecurity dynamics. cybersecurity foundation. cybersecurity metrics. cybersecurity quantification. cybersecurity risk management. science of cybersecurity 
Improving cybersecurity hygiene through JIT patching. Vulnerability patch management remains one of the most complex issues facing modern enterprises. companies struggle to test and deploy new patches across their networks, often leaving myriad attack vectors vulnerable to exploits. This problem is exacerbated by enterprise server applications, which expose tremendous amounts of information about their security postures, greatly expediting attackers' reconnaissance incursions (e.g., knowledge gathering attacks). Unfortunately, current patching processes offer no insights into attacker activities, and prompt attack remediation is hindered by patch compatibility considerations and deployment cycles. To reverse this asymmetry, a patch management model is proposed to facilitate the rapid injection of software patches into live, commodity applications without disruption of production workflows, and the transparent sandboxing of suspicious processes for counterreconnaissance and threat information gathering. Our techniques improve workload visibility and vulnerability management, and overcome perennial shortcomings of traditional patching methodologies, such as proneness to attacker fingerprinting, and the high cost of deployment. The approach enables a large variety of novel defense scenarios, including rapid security patch testing with prompt recovery from defective patches and the placement of exploit sensors inlined into production workloads. An implementation for six enterprise-grade server programs demonstrates that our approach is practical and incurs minimal runtime overheads. Moreover, four use cases are discussed, including a practical deployment on two public cloud environments. Cyber deception. Hot patching. Security patching 
CYBER SECURITY in VEHICLE COMMUNICATION.In the Automotive Industry, cyber security implementation is low. A car has multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and every ECU communicates a huge number of messages to another ECU through Control Area Network (CAN). If the hacker invades the system, then it is like an open source of resources and any amount of valuable information can be manipulated. This can lead to a great damage. This is a motivation to verify various existing cyber security features, understand the system and then implement the cyber security features. In this paper, key slot verification design, maximum authoritative counter verification design and user mode implementation have been discussed. The Automotive Open Source Architecture (AUTOSAR) platform is used for development in the automotive industry. authoritative counter. Automotive Open Source Network (AUTOSAR).

Design of Power Grid Cyber Security Framework Based on Whole Life Cycle Management.The whole process security of power information system is the key to make power grid operation safe and stable. Firstly, the concept and characteristics of whole life cycle management (WLCM) are summarized by this paper systematically. Secondly, the power network security architecture based on full life cycle security management is constructed, which is designed to protect the cyber security of power grid from three aspects: control flow, technical support system and mechanism guarantee system. Thirdly, the cyber security's management and control flow of power grid, the technical support system of power grid cyber security (PGIS) and the mechanism guarantee system based on life cycle management are proposed. And the control flow, technical support and guarantee mechanism were designed in detail. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is carried out in a provincial power-grid company. The results show that this method can significantly reduce the power network security risk and improve the power grid network security level, which is of great significance to the operation safety of the power grid and has strong engineering application value.
Contextualised Cyber Security Awareness Approach for Online Romance Fraud.Action Fraud reported 50 million pounds was lost to romance fraud in 2018, a 27% increase on the previous year, despite an increase in publicity and guidance surrounding the issue. Romance fraud is an ever-increasing issue, and the statistics highlight the need for a proactive, adaptable, and bespoke approach to assist online dating platforms in combatting the problem, providing targeted awareness to customers while improving the user experience of dating platforms. Currently, there is no effective approach for increasing user awareness and providing real-Time intervention on romance fraud. Existing methods on the platform focus on identifying, preventing, and stopping threat actors with technological measures rather than educating potential victims. This paper discusses the existing state of romance fraud and proposes a solution to mitigate the problems by developing a targeted awareness approach. The solution can be adopted by online dating platforms for early identification and timely intervention. It includes bespoke advisory messages to be provided to the user and risk categorisation criteria as well as workflows and prototypes to assist platforms with implementation. The results from the primary research clearly support the objectives showing that timely intervention helps to mitigate against fraud, decreasing the likelihood of it occurring. This approach offers demonstrable improvements to dating platforms. awareness approach. dating platforms. romance fraud 
Cybersecurity Curricula Recommendations Development for Technical Background and Engineering Skills in International Dimension. The risks of information security threats in conditions of rapidly increasing use of information and communication technologies in society, economy and public administration have led to the need for a significant increase of information reliability. The efficient education for international career building of young engineers in the technical aspects of Cyber security is discussed in this article. The mission of such engineers is the development of technical assets, mechanisms, electronic devices and systems, as well as integration legacy solutions and reengineering of systems, taking into account protection of information assets. It has become one of the fastest growing information technology in industries today, mainly due to two trends: (1) exponential growth of data from business systems and security sensors to protect this business. (2) lack of qualified cyber security staff to analyze and respond to incidents related to these data. The market analysis on the international and national levels, chows, that the number of vacancies in area is growing, for example the number of specialists required by CERT.LV only is around 200, and they estimate that the number of employees required by private companies is several hundreds on national level. Developed countries laws require companies to designate a qualified person responsible for IT security issues and the development and maintenance of technological solutions. The task of a cyber security specialist in companies and different organizations is to manage security solutions, consult users and provide expertise not only engineering background, but also background in IT security issues. Implementation of these tasks requires a wide range of multidisciplinary knowledge, including computer networking, software, integrated systems, critical infrastructure security and security management. cyber security. education. electrical engineering.

A Subjective Network Approach for Cybersecurity Risk Assessment.We propose a subjective Bayesian network approach for cybersecurity risk assessment to address the limitations of traditional risk assessment models, which use precise values for the likelihoods of cyber-attacks. In many situations, it is often difficult to elicit accurate probabilities due to lack of knowledge, or insufficient historical data, making the evaluation of risk in existing approaches unreliable. With this approach, we seek to better reflect the reality underpinning the model and offer a better approach to decision-making via the modelling of uncertainty about the probability distributions in the form of subjective opinions, resulting in a model taking second-order uncertainty into account. We develop a subjective Bayesian network for cybersecurity risk, and then discuss the risk evaluation and decision analysis problem under the proposed model. Finally, our approach is evaluated against classical Bayesian networks using the scenario of wiper malware in an industrial control system. Our results show that taking uncertainty about the probabilities into account during security risk analysis can lead to different outcomes, and therefore different security decisions. decision analysis. multi-attribute risk. risk analysis. subjective Bayesian networks 
Neural network approach to assessing cybersecurity risks in large-scale dynamic networks.The problem, the solution of which the paper is devoted to, is an assessment of the cybersecurity risks of large-scale dynamic networks of smart city (IoT, IIoT, MANET, VANET) in the current situation of cyber threats. Analysis of relevant cyber threats for such systems showed that the main threats are those aimed at disrupting the management processes of enterprises, urban infrastructure, and not at stealing personal data. As a result of a detailed review of existing risk assessment methods, it was found that traditional cyber-risk analysis strategies developed for static computer networks do not meet the requirements and cannot be directly applied in the construction and evaluation of heterogeneous, flexible, reconfigurable information systems based on dynamic networks. In this paper, the author proposes a neural network approach to assessing cybersecurity risks, based on a quantitative assessment and takes into account the use of a large number of devices and their constant interaction. A three-layer perceptron was chosen as a model of a neural network, datasets were generated synthetically using a network simulator NS-3. Experimental results showed that the neural network model proposed by the author allows for rapidly changing conditions to unambiguously and reasonably assess the risks of cybersecurity. The developed risk assessment method is comprehensive and adapted to various types of objects in large dynamic networks of a smart city. ANN. Cybersecurity. Large-Scale Network. Machine Learning.

CyberSecurity Attack Prediction: A Deep Learning Approach.Cybersecurity attacks are exponentially increasing, making existing detection mechanisms insufficient and enhancing the necessity to design more relevant prediction models and approaches. This issue is still an open research problem since existing attack prediction models are failing to follow the huge amount of attacks and their variety. Recently, machine learning approaches and especially deep learning techniques have received much attention from researchers since their unparalleled high performance in several prediction-based fields. In this context, this paper explores the application of deep learning techniques for predicting cybersecurity attacks. Particularly, it proposes a new LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) based models carefully designed to predict the type of attack potentially to hap-pen. The proposed models were validated using a recently available dataset called CTF showing encouraging results especially for the LSTM model with an f-measure greater than 93%.

A Proposed Cyber security framework for auditing in financial institutions.The continued rise of cyber threats has led some scholars to question the role of auditors and the effectiveness of audits in ensuring cyber security. This paper aims to examine cyber security from an auditing perspective and develop a framework that can enhance cyber security in financial institutions. Given the limitations of the existing frameworks, this paper develops a more comprehensive framework for auditing cyber security that integrates aspects of the role theory, lending credibility theory, the policemen theory, defense in depth theory, COBIT5, NIST cyber security framework and ISO standards, among others. The framework can enable more effective ways of auditing cyber security with the aim of improving cyber safety in financial institutions. cyber security. cyber threats. information technology auditing 
Smart Grid and Cybersecurity Challenges.In the modern and computerized energy industry cyber security plays a critical role alongside physical security. The smart grid is considered as one of the leading revolutionary innovations in this industry with established solutions and engineering sciences that support the efficiency, flexibility and reliability of power, gas and water systems. A cybersecurity breach in this industry can have irreversible consequences resulting in disasters that threaten human life, along with more tradition consequences in security principles such as confidentiality, integrity and availability of the service or data. This paper seeks to describe the cyber security issues present in smart grids, including past challenges and their root causes, and proposes methodological approaches to protect the smart grid against cyber security attacks by proposing potential mitigating controls.

SecBot: A business-driven conversational agent for cybersecurity planning and management.Businesses were moving during the past decades to-ward full digital models, which made companies face new threats and cyberattacks affecting their services and, consequently, their profits. To avoid negative impacts, companies' investments in cybersecurity are increasing considerably. However, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) operate on small budgets, minimal technical expertise, and few personnel to address cybersecurity threats. In order to address such challenges, it is essential to promote novel approaches that can intuitively present cybersecurity-related technical information.This paper introduces SecBot, a cybersecurity-driven conversational agent (i.e., chatbot) for the support of cybersecurity planning and management. SecBot applies concepts of neural networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to interact and extract information from a conversation. SecBot can (a) identify cyberattacks based on related symptoms, (b) indicate solutions and configurations according to business demands, and (c) provide insightful information for the decision on cybersecurity investments and risks. A formal description had been developed to describe states, transitions, a language, and a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation. A case study and a performance evaluation were conducted to provide evidence of the proposed solution's feasibility and accuracy.
A Review on Application of Knowledge Graph in Cybersecurity.With the development of information technology and the increasing complexity cyber environment, the volume of data involved in cybersecurity is also increasing rapidly and the risks of cybersecurity are also increased. There is an urgent need to find correlation and attack patterns from fragmented and massive multi-source heterogeneous cyberspace related data. The construction of cyberspace security knowledge graph can build massive fragmented multi-source heterogeneous data into one module and conduct fine-grained deep association analysis. To provide further master the cyberspace security situation and auxiliary decision-making. In this paper, we summarizes the development of knowledge graph related technology and the application of knowledge graph in cyberspace. cyber security. graph technology. knowledge graph 
Federated learning for cyber security: SOC collaboration for malicious URL detection.Managed security service providers increasingly rely on machine-learning methods to exceed traditional, signature-based threat detection and classification methods. As machine-learning often improves with more data available, smaller organizations and clients find themselves at a disadvantage: Without the ability to share their data and others willing to collaborate, their machine-learned threat detection will perform worse than the same model in a larger organization. We show that Federated Learning, i.e. collaborative learning without data sharing, successfully helps to overcome this problem. Our experiments focus on a common task in cyber security, the detection of unwanted URLs in network traffic seen by security-as-a-service providers. Our experiments show that i) Smaller participants benefit from larger participants ii) Participants seeing different types of malicious traffic can generalize better to unseen types of attacks, increasing performance by 8% to 15% on average, and up to 27% in the extreme case. iii) Participating in Federated training never harms the performance of the locally trained model. In our experiment modeling a security-as-a service setting, Federated Learning increased detection up to 30% for some participants in the scheme. This clearly shows that Federated Learning is a viable approach to address issues of data sharing in common cyber security settings. cyber-security. Federated-learning. Machine-learning 
A Deep Neural Network Approach to Tracing Paths in Cybersecurity Investigations.Security Analysts (SAs) operating within Security Operation Centers (SOCs) conduct cybersecurity investigations on cyber events using methods which pave a measurable path. These paths serve as a source of evidence to study the transitions of the cognitive tasks performed by the SA throughout the investigation. Insight into these paths can support the observation and understanding of how to evaluate and measure the critical decisions made during an investigation such as when a SA transitions from analyzing event logs to observing threat intelligence. We propose a framework we call the Cyber Analysis Transition Framework which applies a quantitative approach for evaluating and measuring the transitions of the SA conducting cyber analysis methods. The novel approach for this framework includes the application of process mining and deep neural network output as a means for evaluating and measuring a SA's performance while conducting cybersecurity investigations. cyber analysis framework. cybersecurity investigations. deep neural network. process mining 
Applying parallel and distributed computing curriculum to cyber security courses.Parallel technologies evolve at a fast rate, with new hardware and programming frameworks being introduced every few years. Keeping a Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) lecture up to date is a challenge in itself, let alone when one has to consider the synergies between other courses and the shifts in direction that are industry-driven and echo inside the student body. This paper details the process of aligning parallel and distributed curriculum at the Military Technical Academy of Bucharest (MTA) over the last five years, with government and industry demands as well as faculty and student expectations. The result has been an adaptation and an update of the previous lectures and assignments on PDC, and the creation of a new course that relies heavily on parallel technologies to provide a modern outlook on software security and the tools used to combat cyber threats. Concepts and assignments originally designed for a PDC course have molded perfectly into a new supporting paradigm focused on malicious code (malware) analysis. GPU Computing. Malware Analysis.

A Blockchain Solution for Enhancing Cybersecurity Defence of IoT.The growth of IoT devices during the last decade has led to the development of smart ecosystems, such as smart homes, prone to cyberattacks. Traditional security methodologies support to some extend the requirement for preserving privacy and security of such deployments, but their centralized nature in conjunction with low computational capabilities of smart home gateways make such approaches not efficient. Last achievements on blockchain technologies allowed the use of such decentralized architectures to support cybersecurity defence mechanisms. In this work, a blockchain framework is presented to support the cybersecurity mechanisms of smart homes installations, focusing on the immutability of users and devices that constitute such environments. The proposed methodology provides also the appropriate smart contracts support for ensuring the integrity of the smart home gateway and IoT devices, as well as the dynamic and immutable management of blocked malicious IPs. The framework has been deployed on a real smart home environment demonstrating its applicability and efficiency. Blockchain. Cybersecurity. IoT. smart home

Cyber security risk identification in power internet of things system.For Energy Internet, Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things (UPIoT) not only promotes its digital and intelligent level, but also brings uncertain social factors, which provides a new environment for its cyber risk brewing and diffusion. Correctly, understanding and evaluating the cyber security risk of UPIoT is an important guarantee for Energy Internet Construction. A method to evaluate and quantize cybersecurity risk of UPIoT is proposed to determine the potential risk. Using AHP algorithm and security state to quantify the risk of network unit, the cyber security risk assessment of network is evaluated combined with the network unit importance.

The cyber security in the age of telework: A descriptive research framework through science mapping.Teleworking is a work model that has been widely accepted by organizations, mostly since it has many advantages over traditional work. Most organizations have implemented it to attract new human talent and keep the existing one, preventing the flight of intellect or theft by competition. For the worker it also presents several advantages, such as savings in travel times, savings in fuel costs and more free time. However, one of the many disadvantages of teleworking is information security. We live in a digitized world, where cyber attacks represent a great threat for users and organizations, attacks that are increasing day by day. Cyber security, also known as information technology security or electronic information security, has become a necessity in the world we live in, where ICTs have had a great development as well as acceptance by users. Cyber security seeks to identify the strategies, to implement and to maintain a safe environment, but also to prevent threats and/or attacks. The main objective of cyber security is to generate trust between customers, suppliers and the general market, about the information that is handled on the network. Cyber security must be one step ahead of crime to offer support in all the digital movements that we do. business intelligence. cyber security. homeworking. strategic intelligence. telework 
Deconstructing Cybersecurity: From Ontological Security to Ontological Insecurity.This paper examines the philosophical aspects of cybersecurity through the lens of deconstruction, as proposed by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. We offer deconstruction as an analytical orientation to better understand and challenge the very philosophical concepts a security system presupposes, arguing that not only are concrete systems necessarily insecure but that the concepts and structures through which their security is understood are also insecure. By centering our discourse on instability and contradictions, we demonstrate the relevance of deconstruction in cybersecurity through four concrete examples drawn from four different areas: digital rights management, cyberwar, software vulnerability, and user authentication. We further address the concept of ontological security to draw the boundaries between beneficial and detrimental uses of deconstruction. These insights complement other HCISec efforts to conceptualize cybersecurity as a holistic discipline that incorporates art and philosophy in addition to science and technology. cybersecurity.

Measuring Learning in a Cyber Security Exercise.In recent years, cyber security exercises have established themselves as an integral part of cyber security education. Cyber security professionals usually work as a part of a team that monitors and responds to incidents in the environment. A sufficiently realistic complex learning environment is necessary for collaborative learning at the expert level. Evaluating the learning outcomes of complex exercises is an important task for both assessing how individuals met the learning objectives, and how to improve the exercise to better serve those goals. This requires the assessment of multiple skill and knowledge categories independently. We leveraged the NIST NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework as a base for building knowledge categories for questionnaire use. However, the NICE framework is comprehensive and detailed requiring that the areas of competence assessment needed to be simplified for questionnaire use. We summarized the NICE framework into 44 questions addressed to the individuals who participated in the exercise. A web-based questionnaire was used to query 21 participants' skill level before and after the exercise, as well as their familiarity and experience with the topic before and during the exercise. The results indicate that cyber security exercises will increase the knowledge of the participant in the knowledge areas that were present in the exercise. This increase was more prominent in cases where the participant was more likely to recognize, and experience events related to that category during the exercise. Furthermore, we concluded that the NICE framework can be used to assess individual know-how and as a basis for knowledge-related questionnaires. Competence. Cyber Arena. Cyber security. Education.

Assessing Cyber Security Education through NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.This paper presents the results of research and assessment of cyber security education in higher education in Europe and the United States of America. The quantitative research data of the education curricula was gathered and mapped to NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) categories to provide a common background for data comparison and analysis. The research found the education heavily responding to and emphasizing Operate and Maintain and Securely Provision categories of the framework, with others being present, but with smaller ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) offering in the institutions providing higher education. This leaves doubt if the used framework accurately describes the workforce, or if the education fails to deliver on all categories. Based on these results, more adapt curriculum and course design can be conducted by educators focusing on cyber security. Cyber Security. Degree Programme. Education.

Teaching Cyber-Security for Distance Learners: A Reflective Study.The number of distance learning degrees has increased dramatically over the last decade. Yet, despite this increase, teaching computer security subjects for online students remains challenging. Online classes often need a special infrastructure such as devices with specific tools, or hardware requirements. It is also a challenge to design a course that is pedagogically sound, engaging and fun for students who may come from a wide spectrum of educational backgrounds. The quality of the education delivered also differs from one institution to another. To provide a sense of accreditation and regulation, the National Cyber-security Centre, which is a part of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the United Kingdom (UK) has certified only two online (i.e. distance learning) cybersecurity MSc degrees in the country.This paper presents an innovative way of designing capstone projects (i.e. case studies) along with the impact of it on retention, completion, and success rates in a world-class distance learning degree at the University of Liverpool (UoL) over the last ten years. The Chartered Institute for IT (i.e. BSC) is the accreditation body of the degree program studied in this research. Capstone Projects. case study-based projects. Distance Learning.

Overcoming the Challenges of Teaching Cybersecurity in UK Computer Science Degree Programmes. This Innovative Practice Full Paper explores the diversity of challenges relating to the teaching of cybersecurity in UK higher education degree programmes, through the lens of national policy, to the impact on pedagogy and practice.There is a serious demand for cybersecurity specialists, both in the UK and globally. there is thus significant and growing higher education provision related to specialist undergraduate and postgraduate courses focusing on varying aspects of cybersecurity. To make our digital systems and products more secure, all in IT need to know some cybersecurity - thus, there is a case for depth as well as breadth. this is not a new concern, but it is a growing one. Delivering cybersecurity effectively across general computer science programmes presents a number of challenges related to pedagogy, resources, faculty and infrastructure, as well as responding to industry requirements.Computer science and cognate engineering disciplines are evolving to meet these demands - both at school-level, as well as at university - however, doing so is not without challenges. This paper explores the progress made to date in the UK, building on previous work in cybersecurity education and accreditation by highlighting key challenges and opportunities, as well as identifying a number of enhancement activities for use by the international cybersecurity education community. It frames these challenges through concerns with the quality and availability of underpinning educational resources, the competencies and skills of faculty (especially focusing on pedagogy, progression and assessment), and articulating the necessary technical resources and infrastructure related to delivering rigorous cybersecurity content in general computer science and cognate degrees.Though this critical evaluation of an emerging national case study of cybersecurity education in the UK, we also present a number of recommendations across policy and practice - from pedagogic principles and developing effective cybersecurity teaching practice, challenges in the recruitment, retention and professional development of faculty, to supporting diverse routes into post-compulsory cybersecurity education (and thus, diverse careers) - to provide the foundation for potential replicability and portability to other jurisdictions contemplating related education and skills reform initiatives and interventions. accreditation. assessment. computer science education. curricula. cybersecurity. pedagogy.

A pragmatic cybersecurity strategies for combating IoT-cyberattacks.Massive Cyberattacks, especially Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), remain an overwhelming threat to new emerging computer paradigms such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, deployed within critical infrastructures (healthcare, aviation, energy, industrial control and military). Furthermore, conventional security approaches and strategies are no longer appropriate to deal with this kind of cyberattacks, for the reason that they have major limitations. Consequently, identification and efficient detection of anomalies in this context requires not only suitable mechanisms integrating correct detection, but also early detection with an autonomous operating mode. This paper focuses on DDoS cyberattack detection and mitigation method based on artificial intelligence model affecting IoT network infrastructure. Cybersecurity. DDoS Cyberattacks. IoT 
Cybersecurity for microgrid.As we strive to reduce our carbon footprint and move towards a greener eco-friendly world, digital technology can be harnessed to address the challenges facing consumers and power distribution networks by managing their energy needs through the deployment of the microgrid.Microgrids integrate local energy production from renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, etc.) providing locally optimized distributed energy generation and storage along with resilience against disruption in power distribution through self-islanding. However, the very attributes that make the microgrid suitable for deployment also makes it susceptible to security breaches.Some technologies that improve the security posture around the microgrid and provide a more secure management of energy data while satisfying the energy needs include Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain technology. In this paper we discuss the basic architecture behind these technologies and why they may provide the microgrid with a security solution against cyberattacks. Artificial Intelligence. Blockchain.

Maturity assessment of cyber security in the workforce management domain: A case study in bank indonesia.In the growth of information technology that is very fast, it brings the era to be completely digital or so-called digital age. This phenomenon leads an institution or organization to involve an information technology that can help increase efficiency in carrying out activities and achieving business goals. The use of an information technology does not only have a positive impact. The higher utilization of information technology, the higher the gaps in security incidents and the potential for cybercrimes, so that cybersecurity becomes an important factor to minimize this issue. On the business processes of financial institutions that focus on economic stability and the role of IT as an enabler, however, workforce management that focuses on cybersecurity must be managed properly. This study attempts to assess cybersecurity maturity within the scope of Workforce Management in a case study in Bank Indonesia. The framework used in conducting this assessment is C2M2 Framework which focuses on the Workforce Management Domain. The results of this study indicate that cybersecurity in the workforce management domain at Bank Indonesia has not reached MIL 3. The results of the assessment will serve as a reference for improving cybersecurity in the field of workforce management at Bank Indonesia. Assessment. Cyber security management. Maturity.

Cybersecurity Evaluation Methodology for Distributed Energy Resources: Industrial Demonstration.With the widespread integration of renewable energy resources, the occurrence of electric power output control is increasing in Japan, especially for photovoltaic (PV) power plants. The practical application of smart inverters that can perform electric power output control more flexibly over the network has gradually progressed. Still, there is a remaining issue regarding how to determine the implementation method and scope of the cybersecurity evaluation for distributed energy resources (DER), including smart inverters. Therefore, we generated a set of security evaluation items, tools, and supporting environments. We validated these with academics, manufacturers, and electric power companies in realistic settings, after which we were finally able to arrange evaluation methods. In this paper, we describe how we performed the industrial demonstration experiments and what we learned through the trials. DER Cybersecurity. DERMS. ECHONET Lite. IEC 61850. OpenADR. PV.

Cyber Security System with FPGA-based Network Intrusion Detector for Nuclear Power Plant. As the general-purpose network technologies were introduced into the factory automation network, the importance of a high performance network intrusion detection system (NIDS) has rapidly increased. In this paper, we proposed a cyber security system that can be used in control networks that require high levels of reliability, such as nuclear power plants. The proposed system consists of DACS(Detection on Attacking Control System), DACS management program(DMP) to centrally manage multiple DACS, and central monitoring system(CMS) to store system logs. The packet detection function of DACS is handled by a real-time packet detector implemented in FPGA that handles a 7-tuple whitelist. MAC address, IP address, protocol, and TCP/UDP port number of the source and destination network nodes. This paper showed the usefulness of the proposed system by presenting an example of applying the proposed system to the nuclear power plant safety system. However, it was shown that the proposed system is not limited to nuclear power plants, but can be applied to control networks in various fields. Cyber security. FPGA.

Software Engineering: The First Line of Defense for Cybersecurity.Cybersecurity has become an area of critical concern due to an ever-growing number of security breaches. Some of these breaches compromise personal information, exposing individuals and firms to potential identity theft, fraud and other maladies. Other attacks seek to gain control of systems for use in attacking as part of bot nets and other indirect attack techniques. Yet other attacks target cyber-physical systems whose compromise could potentially lead to the injury or death of individuals relying on or nearby the equipment. This paper considers the role of software engineering in preventing cyberattacks and discusses the types of software engineering failures that translate into vulnerabilities that can be attacked. Prospective solutions and areas of needed future research are discussed. bugs. cybersecurity. defense. development techniques. software engineering. testing 
Determining the impact of cybersecurity failures during and attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations.In emergency situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, less immediate concerns such as cybersecurity and long-term economic impact can fall by the wayside. This paper presents a discussion of the impact of cybersecurity issues that occur during and are attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations. This discussion is facilitated by a simulation tool, the Disaster Vulnerability Threat and Impact Simulator System (DVTISS). DVTISS simulates the network structure, security measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region's computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support. Based on the example emergencies, the paper also discusses key areas of vulnerability during emergency situations and their financial, data and system outage impacts. Cybersecurity. Economics.

Intrusion Detection for Cybersecurity of Power Electronics Dominated Grids: Inverters PQ Set-Points Manipulation.This work provides cybersecurity analytics for a high photovoltaic (PV) penetrated distribution network, representing future power electronics dominated grid (PEDG). Firstly, the impact of active and reactive power (PQ) set-points manipulation on the network is studied. Then, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed for identifying the potentially compromised PV inverters in the network. The proposed IDS is based on defining the normal, safe, and abnormal operation regions of the PV inverters from point of view of the steady state voltage stability of the network. These three-operation regions are identified by utilizing active power, reactive power, and voltage (PQV) limits of each specific grid-following inverter in the network. Each grid-following inverter's PQV contour includes the information of network topology, inverter ratings, and inverter controller. The developed PQ limits are integrated into the centralized secondary control layer for realization of the proposed IDS. Furthermore, the proposed secondary control layer is capable of providing remedial actions during an anomaly event to enhance the grid resiliency. The theoretical analyses are verified by several attack scenarios for a network of grid-following inverters. cybersecurity. grid-connected inverter. grid-following inverter. intrusion detection systems. power electronics grid 
Comparative Analysis of Cyber Security Approaches Using Machine Learning in Industry 4.0.The concept of Industry 4.0 emerged due to the increase in production in the industry, the need for high efficiency in production and the desire to benefit from the features of technology. In Industry 4.0, the data from the systems can be used in real time with the internet technology, the operation of the systems is automated using the internet technology. can be remotely controlled and managed by system administrators. In addition to the contribution of technology to the industrial field, network technology that enables critical systems to communicate with each other causes systems to be exposed to cyber attacks. In this study, it is mentioned that signature-based attack detection systems aren't effective in new generation attacks and machine learning algorithms are successful in detecting next generation attacks. In order to verify, the data obtained from the traffic of the industrial system network and machine learning (ML) algorithms were trained and the performances of the algorithms in predicting cyber attacks were compared. The performance of each algorithm shows their accuracy in predicting attacks. Traditional Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are used to detect attacks. With this study, it is aimed to gain a perspective on attack detection studies with machine learning techniques in Industry 4.0. Cyber Security. Industry 4.0. Machine Learning 
Agent Based Cybersecurity Model for Business Entity Risk Assessment.Computer networks and surging advancements of innovative information technology construct a critical infrastructure for network transactions of business entities. Information exchange and data access though such infrastructure is scrutinized by adversaries for vulnerabilities that lead to cyber-attacks. This paper presents an agent-based system modelling to conceptualize and extract explicit and latent structure of the complex enterprise systems as well as human interactions within the system to determine common vulnerabilities of the entity. The model captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple network agents including the number of workstations, regular, administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks, defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the time it takes to revert into normal state. The model will also associate a relevant cost per incident occurrence that derives the need for enhancement of security solutions. agent-based modelling. cybersecurity. defense strategies. network threats. risk assessment 
Cybersecurity Framework for P300-based Brain Computer Interface.This paper describes a cybersecurity framework for protecting brain computer interface (BCI) technology. This framework consists of cybersecurity risk scenarios related to user safety/privacy and best practices to manage them. This framework provides solutions for privacy and safety issues of the existing noninvasive BCIs (e.g., electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI). We chose to design a P300-based BCI application because it is the most popular modality, simulate some common cybersecurity attacks, and find a relevant solution to protect the user and/or integrated EEG hardware-software system. In this paper, we describe how cybersecurity risks could affect BCI form streaming/recording EEG signal in real-time until sending commands. We used EEG Equipment for measuring brain activity and Python programing language to build our experimental paradigm, record EEG signal, classify P300 components, send a message to another user, simulate some attacks, and find perfect solutions for assuring high BCI protection. This paper gives an overview of the framework, some description of BCI hacking challenges and their impact on BCI users as well as a preliminary demonstration of a P300-based BCI system with two common simple attacks.

Cybersecurity Impact over Bigdata and IoT Growth. Big Data and IoT based applications are promising and being necessary for almost all the fields. IoT applications provide us with beneficial services, and also they gather and transmit data to Big Data databases where data can be stored and analyzed. Big Data and IoT started to be involved in smart homes, smart healthcare, education, shopping and even in agriculture field. These Big Data and IoT based applications are growing rapidly. The more these technologies are giving us great applications and making our life better. the more cybersecurity attacks start against them. These applications are the target for attackers due to the useful and massive amount of data they have. Cybersecurity is a significant issue for these technologies. Cybersecurity threats and attacks can stop these technologies from growing, which is considered to be a negative point for us and these promising technologies. Cybersecurity threats weaken these technologies to gain full access over the user's data. Understanding the possible applications and benefits that we could learn from these technologies is important Also, understanding and being aware of the possible threats that could threaten the various Big Data and IoT based applications is more critical Understanding the possible cybersecurity attacks and threats can help us to know about how to protect these technologies and applications from cybersecurity attacks. This research presents critical cybersecurity impacts in the form of security threats, and attacks that could be initiated against Big Data and IoT based applications and affect their growth. These impacts are elaborated using a case study of a healthcare system with its possible cybersecurity attacks, which shows the relation between cybersecurity attacks and the growth of Big Data and IoT technologies.

Cybersecurity Assessment Using Delay from Backlog Bound Calculation.During the last decade, cybersecurity assessment has become a key issue among all security problems encountered in designing and managing complex systems. Today, for dealing with cybersecurity, many sophisticated models are available. Still, the classic CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability remains actual and useful. In this article, following the CIA model, we investigate cybersecurity of control systems. After some research, we make it clear that availability is the most critical property of cybersecurity in the operational technology context, and so can be used as an indicator of cybersecurity. Conducting a review of availability definitions, we elect a proper interpretation of availability with a delay as a measure for its evaluation. For calculations, we use a theory of deterministic queueing systems Network calculus, but in contrast to the common practice of delay calculation through the bounds of the arrival flow and service, we investigate another critical case where a delay can be estimated from the knowledge of the backlog bound and the framework of service curves. A problem for systems with a linear relationship between the minimum and maximum service curves and a special case of rate-latency service curves are examined. availability. backlog.

Integrated Cybersecurity plus Robotics Lesson Using NAO.This paper describes a novel experimental study that investigates the merits of an integrated cybersecurity plus robotics lesson plan, using the NAO humanoid robot, when it comes to introducing cybersecurity and robotics together to college and pre-college learners. We first present our unique cybersecurity plus robotics lesson, which is based upon a nifty experiential-learning model that combines basic cybersecurity concepts with educational robotics (ER) in the form of a hands-on experiment with NAO. Our lesson plan includes a demonstration of a successful hack into NAO's video stream, followed by covert capturing of its live camera feed. We then discuss results from two separate experimental case studies, the first one being a conventional approach of introducing cybersecurity concepts via a traditional lesson plan, which involves no robot. The second study involves our non-traditional technique of introducing cybersecurity plus robotics using NAO. We present the student survey data collected from these two studies and discuss their respective outcomes. We also analyze the pre and post student survey-based assessment data from these studies for showing preliminary evidence of the effectiveness and potential of our approach. Existing literature indicates that there is limited work on investigating the efficacy of learning cybersecurity plus ER using an interactive, humanoid robot, like NAO. Our work is an attempt to address this research gap in the literature. We intend to prepare the grounds for further research within this emerging topic of integrated cybersecurity and robotics education, so that students can gain from a positive and engaging experiential-learning experience. college. cybersecurity. educational robotics. experiential-learning. experimental case study. hacking. high school. learner assessment. nao humanoid robot. pre-college. student survey

A Cybersecurity Course for Everyone. In 2003, The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace was published with a goal to  engage and empower Americans to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact . It called for a  coordinated and focused effort from our entire society to secure cyberspace. Subsequent updates to this strategy continued to support this idea. This paper addresses Penn College'S effort to develop an introduction to cybersecurity course that addresses this need. Based on the content of our major specific introduction to cybersecurity course, a new course was designed to lower the barriers to entry for non-IT students while at the same time presenting cybersecurity principles in a manner that was applicable to all majors. computing for everyone. cybersecurity. cybersecurity education. cybersecurity for everyone 
National and International Issues of Cyber Security.Improving cyber security is the purpose of all states. Military-industrial complex is in need of creating innovative protection systems for their cyber space. A lack of such security systems can lead to the global disaster, using nuclear weapons. Today's legal regulation of the national personal data still does not provide for legal regulation of user data which can be obtained via gadgets fitted with cameras, speakers, applications. Apart from information leakage as a result of hacker attacks, and accidental cyber leaks, the great problem is related to unlawful leakage and data stolen by company employees. Although the legislation of personal data protection is improving with allowance for precedents in this sphere leading to cybercrimes, an amount of unlawful use of personal data by company employees do not decrease due to a lack of accountability and behavior code in the sphere of personal data processing.

Ensuring Cybersecurity of Data Transmission in Limited Energy Consumption Networks.In the northern gas fields, most data are transmitted via wireless networks, which requires special transmission security measures. Herewith, the gas field infrastructure dictates cybersecurity modules to not only meet standard requirements but also ensure reduced energy consumption. The paper discusses the issue of building such a module for a process control system based on the RTP-04M recorder operating in conjunction with an Android-based mobile device. The software options used for the RSA and Diffie-Hellman data encryption and decryption algorithms on both the RTP-04M and the Android-based mobile device sides in the Keil \muVision4 and Android Studio software environments, respectively, have shown that the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is preferable. It provides significant savings in RAM and CPU resources and power consumption of the recorder. In terms of energy efficiency, the implemented programs have been analyzed in the Android Studio (Android Profiler) and Simplicity Studio (Advanced Energy Monitor) environments. The integration of this module into the existing software will improve the field's PCS cybersecurity level due to protecting data transmitted from third-party attacks. asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithm. cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity Event Detection with New and Re-emerging Words.There is plenty of threat-related information in open data sources. Early identification of emerging security threats from such information is an important part of security for deployed software and systems. While several cybersecurity event detection methods have been proposed to extract security events from unstructured text in open data sources, most of the existing methods focus on detecting events that have a large volume of mentions. On the contrary, to respond faster than attackers, security analysts and IT operators need to be aware of critical security events as early as possible, no matter how many mentions about an event are made. In this paper, we propose a novel event detection system that can quickly identify critical security events, such as new threats and resurgence of an attack or related event, from Twitter regardless of their volume of mentions. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed method triggers events by monitoring new words and re-emerging words, making it possible to narrow down candidate events among several hundreds of events. It then forms events by clustering tweets linked with the trigger words. This approach enables us to detect new and resurgent threats as early as possible. We empirically demonstrate that our system works promisingly over a wide range of threat types. event detection. ewma. statistical significance. twitter 
Incorporating SCADA Cybersecurity in Undergraduate Engineering Technology Information Technology Education.The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it makes the case for incorporating cybersecurity principles into undergraduate Engineering Technology Education and for incorporating Industrial Control Systems (ICS) principles into undergraduate Information Technology (IT)/Cybersecurity Education. Specifically, the paper highlights the knowledge/skill gap between engineers and IT/Cybersecurity professionals with respect to the cybersecurity of the ICS. Secondly, it identifies several areas where traditional IT systems and ICS intercept. This interception not only implies that ICS are susceptible to the same cyber threats as traditional IT/IS but also to threats that are unique to ICS. Subsequently, the paper identifies several areas where cybersecurity principles can be applied to ICS. By incorporating cybersecurity principles into Engineering Technology Education, the paper hopes to provide IT/Cybersecurity and Engineering Students with (a) the theoretical knowledge of the cybersecurity issues associated with administering and operating ICS and (b) the applied technical skills necessary to manage and mitigate the cyber risks against these systems. Overall, the paper holds the promise of contributing to the ongoing effort aimed at bridging the knowledge/skill gap with respect to securing ICS against cyber threats and attacks. cybersecurity.

Cyber-security enabled communication architecture for power routing in the smart grid.Smart grids have benefits such as high reliability and availability due to distributed energy resources (DERs) which are integrated to the power transmission and distribution grid. These DERs will maintain an uninterrupted power supply for electricity consumers in a case of isolation from the primary electricity grid due to failure of the system. The integration of DERs into the transmission and distribution grid introduces new consequence for distributed network operators (DNOs). In traditional electricity grid, power flow is happening normally from the bulk generation stations to consumers and all control operations are done at the centralized control station. In the modern electricity grid with DERs, the energy follows in both directions via substations due to randomly spread energy sources at the lower voltage side. Although distribution network was considered as a static system without major control operations or reconfiguration requirements. For a smart grid, distribution network can be considered as a dynamic system due to DERs. Power routing is an emerging concept. Its main purpose is to make the distribution network more flexible which will help to solve the technical issues related to DERs. With the introduction of DERs, DNOs have faced many challenges. Communication is one of major challenges in DNO Technology. Nowadays most of the communication architectures are based on the Internet that creates major security issues with the system. Cyber-security Enabled Communication Architecture is the most important concept for Power Routing. In this paper we introduce a cyber-security enabled communication architecture that facilitates the security for the information of an electricity grid. Cyber-attacks. Cyber-security.

Detecting cybersecurity attacks using different network features with LightGBM and XGBoost learners.CSE-CIC-IDS2018 is an intrusion detection dataset containing roughly 16, 000, 000 normal and anomalous instances, with about 17% of these instances representing attack traffic. Our big data study has two parts, ensemble feature selection and model comparison. In the first part, we select features from the dataset for input to two classifiers that we employ in the second part. In the second part, we evaluate the performance of the classifiers with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and Fl-score. The outcome of our experiments enables us to answer three research questions. The first question is, 'Does feature selection impact performance of classifiers in terms of AUC and Fl-score?' The second question is, 'Does including the Destination_Port categorical feature significantly impact performance of LightGBM in terms of AUC and Fl-score?' And, our third question is, 'Does the choice of classifier: LightGBM or XGBoost, significantly impact performance in terms of AUC and Fl-score?' For CSE-CIC-IDS2018, we conclude that feature selection and classifier choice impact performance score, and Destination_Port is a significant feature for LightGBM. In our case study, we present the application and analysis of the impact of an ensemble feature selection technique. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique to the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. Big data. Class imbalance. CSE-CIC-IDS2018. Feature selection. Intrusion detection. LightGBM.

Intelligent Cybersecurity Situational Awareness Model Based on Deep Neural Network.In recent years, we have faced a series of online threats. The continuous malicious attacks on the network have directly caused a huge threat to the user's spirit and property. In order to deal with the complex security situation in today's network environment, an intelligent network situational awareness model based on deep neural networks is proposed. Use the nonlinear characteristics of the deep neural network to solve the nonlinear fitting problem, establish a network security situation assessment system, take the situation indicators output by the situation assessment system as a guide, and collect on the main data features according to the characteristics of the network attack method, the main data features are collected and the data is preprocessed. This model designs and trains a 4-layer neural network model, and then use the trained deep neural network model to understand and analyze the network situation data, so as to build the network situation perception model based on deep neural network. The deep neural network situational awareness model designed in this paper is used as a network situational awareness simulation attack prediction experiment. At the same time, it is compared with the perception model using gray theory and Support Vector Machine(SVM). The experiments show that this model can make perception according to the changes of state characteristics of network situation data, establish understanding through learning, and finally achieve accurate prediction of network attacks. Through comparison experiments, datatypized neural network deep neural network situation perception model is proved to be effective, accurate and superior. deep neural network. gray theory. situation awareness

Cyber Security Issues for IoT based Smart Grid Infrastructure.We have been witnessing for several years the increasing networking of objects of all kinds that were not previously used to communicate. These newly connected objects together form the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The energy sector is currently exploring the possibilities offered by the Internet of Things. However, for this sector, network intelligence is not a completely new phenomenon. The electrical networks already have information retrieval capacities for their monitoring and control, but these are still limited. The meeting of IoT and Smart Grids opens the way to data collection from all points of the network and in real time. Certain data previously collected in an aggregated manner over large geographic areas could now be collected on a local scale, near production or transmission points, and at a reasonable cost. It is also the massive accumulation of this data and its processing that is possible today. The smart grid is a network for the transport and distribution of electricity that is enhanced by capacities in terms of digital control, surveillance and telecommunications. It provides a two-way, real-time exchange of energy and information between the various players in the electricity chain, from the production site to commercial, industrial and residential users. The energy transition and the new smart grids raise many challenges in terms of industrial cybersecurity. Digital exchanges are intensifying (production, distribution and consumption are interconnected) and the use of connected objects (facilitating remote monitoring, observation and control of the entire value chain) increases the degree of vulnerability of information systems industrial. The cybersecurity of smart grids is today a decisive element in ensuring global security of our global energy systems. The purpose of this work is to present a comprehensive overview of challenges, threats and some solutions of security in IoT based smart grid. We focus in our study in network vulnerabilities, security requirements and cyber-attacks in smart grid in order to determine their impact in the network and give a guide on future research directions for cyber-security in smart grid applications.

Public and private healthcare organisations: A socio-Technical model for identifying cybersecurity aspects.European Healthcare organisations have met growing common challenges. Health services have been identified at EU level as essential for the maintenance of critical societal and/or economic activities. Furthermore, patient safety and personal data are at risk in daily operations. ICT penetration and the increasing connectivity of devices within a healthcare organisation inevitably lead to a growing dependency on them. Therefore, a solid, cybersecurity prevention strategy is needed. Solidity depends on its capability to capture the Health Services specificities. The article describes a socio-Technical modelling approach, set-up by the H2020 PANACEA project, based on four models (Healthcare Organization (HCOM), Medical Device Lifecycle, Information System Lifecycle, Cybersecurity system). The proposed models can identify cybersecurity aspects, map cybersecurity interventions, and compare cybersecurity solutions for the Healthcare organisations, which, by default, constitute large and complicated structured organisations. Focusing on the HCOM model, this paper presents a methodological tool for identifying the socio-Technical structure (technical and nontechnical) of a healthcare organisation from the cybersecurity perspective, thus delivering a valuable tool for both public and private healthcare organisations.

An uncertain graph-based approach for cyber-security risk assessment.We proposed a novel risk assessment approach for quantifying the security risk of lateral movement attacks, in which the attack propagation is modeled as an uncertain graph and the attack impact is a function of the set of compromised devices. We discussed several risk-based security metrics, including the expected loss, survival function, and conditional expectation - the last two measure the low-probability but high-impact events in the right tail of the loss distribution. The model is illustrated with a simple example and several directions for further research are discussed.
RUCKUS: A cybersecurity engine for performing autonomous cyber-physical system vulnerability discovery at scale.In 2016, the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) provided key foundations and motivations for navigating towards an autonomous cybersecurity approach. Since that time, novel strides have been made in the areas of static analysis, vulnerability discovery, patching, and exploit generation. However, a majority of these efforts have been focused on enterprise systems, leaving a gap in the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) domain. With the rise of connected infrastructure and the introduction of 5G communications, CPS are becoming more ingrained within present-day society. Due to a large amount of legacy software, and control of safety-critical actuation, CPS are and will continue to be a huge attack vector for our adversaries to remotely deploy devastating attacks against our country with low economic cost and at scale. To combat this threat, we propose the need to apply the most beneficial concepts from the CGC to create more secure and resilient CPS. In this paper, we introduce a CPS security assessment architecture RUCKUS for autonomously identifying and analyzing CPS firmware, identifying vulnerabilities, and developing exploits. Further, our approach considers how to integrate graph analytics to extrapolate findings to firmware at scale, allowing for measuring the potential widespread impact of attacks. Our architecture is demonstrated using an automotive case study, leveraging firmware from the most popular automotive and router manufacturers to assess the real-world potential impact of CPS attacks.

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy in the Cloudlet for Preliminary Healthcare Big Data Analytics.In cyber physical systems, cybersecurity and data privacy are among most critical considerations when dealing with communications, processing, and storage of data. Geospatial data and medical data are examples of big data that require seamless integration with computational algorithms as outlined in Industry 4.0 towards adoption of fourth industrial revolution. Healthcare Industry 4.0 is an application of the design principles of Industry 4.0 to the medical domain. Mobile applications are now widely used to accomplish important business functions in almost all industries. These mobile devices, however, are resource poor and proved insufficient for many important medical applications. Resource rich cloud services are used to augment poor mobile device resources for data and compute intensive applications in the mobile cloud computing paradigm. However, the performance of cloud services is undesirable for data-intensive, latency-sensitive mobile applications due increased hop count between the mobile device and the cloud server. Cloudlets are virtual machines hosted in server placed nearby the mobile device and offer an attractive alternative to the mobile cloud computing in the form of mobile edge computing. This paper outlines cybersecurity and data privacy aspects for communications of measured patient data from wearable wireless biosensors to nearby cloudlet host server in order to facilitate the cloudlet based preliminary and essential complex analytics for the medical big data.

Lightweight Testbed for Cybersecurity Experiments in SCADA-based Systems.A rapid rise in cyber-attacks on Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been observed in the last decade. It becomes even more concerning that several of these attacks were on critical infrastructures that indeed succeeded and resulted into significant physical and financial damages. Experimental testbeds capable of providing flexible, scalable and interoperable platform for executing various cybersecurity experiments is highly in need by all stakeholders. A container-based SCADA testbed is presented in this work as a potential platform for executing cybersecurity experiments. Through this testbed, a network traffic containing ARP spoofing is generated that represents a Man in the middle (MITM) attack. While doing so, scanning of different systems within the network is performed which represents a reconnaissance attack. The network traffic generated by both ARP spoofing and network scanning are captured and further used for preparing a dataset. The dataset is utilized for training a network classification model through a machine learning algorithm. Performance of the trained model is evaluated through a series of tests where promising results are obtained. ARP spoofing. Docker. Reconnaissance attack. SCADA. Testbed

Collaborative Visualisation embedded Cost-efficient, Virtualised Cyber Security Operations Centre. The outsourcing of security management has become increasingly attractive for many organisations, this may be the only path available due to the lack of in-house expertise and infrastructure requirements. Deployment of contemporary systems are no longer the essential effective strategies in cybersecurity threat management The managed security service providers offering a raft of essential mature security monitoring and management capabilities. security information and event management, strategic management of organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk and compliance with regulations (GRC) will become the option for many organisations The need for embedding collaborative visualisation in cybersecurity systems are on the rise not only because intelligent visual data displays facilitate the highest possible situation awareness transmitted from the computer to the human but also as it provides the opportunity of collaboration with other experts in a timely manner. It facilitates analysts to acquire a higher number of accurate insights of incidents. Regardless of whether outsourced or on-prem, this will cost organisations a greater amount of money. This paper takes on the challenge proactively by exploring how to establish a virtualised, cyber-security operations centre (C-SOC) that provides information on situation awareness for managing cybersecurity through utilising highly stable open-source network security tools cost-efficiently The infrastructure development is performed by integrating these tools within a VM networking environment.

Adversarial Teaching Approach to Cybersecurity: A Mathematical Model Explains Why It Works Well.Teaching cybersecurity means teaching all possible ways how software can be attacked-and how to fight such attacks. From the usual pedagogical viewpoint, a natural idea seems to be to teach all these ways one by one. Surprisingly, a completely different approach works even better: when the class is divided into sparring mini-Teams that try their best to attack each other and defend from each other. In spite of the lack of thoroughness, this approach generates good specialists-but why? In this paper, by analyzing a simple mathematical model of this situation, we explain why this approach work-and, moreover, we show that it is optimal in some reasonable sense. adversarial teaching. optimal teaching.

Applications of AI in cybersecurity.Issues related to digital security are, there is no doubt for this, of utmost importance in the development of methods and support measures for organisations to successfully prepare for as well as realise their digital transformation. While big organisations and businesses may afford to buy services or develop their own in-house know-how and tools, small and medium-sized businesses are not having the means for this, be them financial resources, human resources or technology itself. This dystopic situation may on the other hand offer an unexpected and - as of today - yet unprecedented chance for innovations in terms of bridging the gap and addressing the need with use of AI technologies and services. In the paper we elaborate on a scenario that we have been developing as part of a European project that is part of the European Horizons 2020 project CS-AWARE. anomaly patterns detection (key words).

Cybersecurity Certification for Agile and Dynamic Software Systems - a Process-Based Approach.In this extended abstract, we outline an approach for security certification of products or services for modern commercial systems that are characterized by agile development, the integration of development and operations, and high dynamics of system features and structures. The proposed scheme rather evaluates the processes applied in development and operations than investigates into the validity of the product properties itself. We argue that the resulting claims are still suitable to increase the confidence in the security of products and services resulting from such processes. agile development. certification. security. software 
Tech Pains: Characterizations of Lived Cybersecurity Experiences.The permeation of technology into every facet of life has profoundly shifted the nature and ramifications of cybersecurity incidents. As a consequence, a complete and refined characterization of these adverse events necessitates a sociotechnical approach that takes into account the subjective lived experiences of the victims. Although researchers have examined such experiences pertaining to specific types of incidents, a broad understanding of the harmful impact of cybersecurity incidents requires an investigation of how people characterize and cope with these adverse experiences in general. To that end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 individuals who reported a variety of cybersecurity incidents, consequences, and coping mechanisms. We found that the experiences can be characterized along a bounded to fuzzy spectrum. As the majority of current cybersecurity efforts focus on relatively bounded incidents, we make the case that fuzzy incidents deserve similar attention because their harmful impacts are deeper and longer-lasting. Our insight can be applied to improve and personalize the delivery of cybersecurity interventions. adverse technology experiences. cybersecurity incidents. lived experiences. privacy. security 
Defensive Programming for Smart Home Cybersecurity.Cybersecurity has become a real issue in the development of smart services in the smart home domain, which is formed by a System of Systems where several smart objects are connected to each other and to the Internet. However, these connections expose the devices to possible attackers inside or outside the network, who may exploit software or hardware vulnerabilities to achieve malicious goals. To alleviate this issue, the use of defensive programming assertions can allow the behaviour of smart objects to be monitored and checked for correctness. Furthermore, open source intelligence tools, such as the Shodan search engine, provide features that could be leveraged to detect potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose an approach for the monitoring of Systems of Systems in the smart home domain exploiting the defensive programming paradigm in combination with Shodan APIs. Cybersecurity.

Learning Analytics Perspective: Evidencing Learning from Digital Datasets in Cybersecurity Exercises.Cybersecurity exercises are gaining in popularity in university curricula and professional training paths and are seen as an effective teaching method. Such exercises provide digital datasets to facilitate a learning analytics approach such as by using the traces that learners leave behind to improve the learning process and environment. While there are various learning measurement efforts from digital datasets in the existing literature, a holistic learning analytics approach incorporated into cybersecurity exercises is still lacking. We propose a practical reference model for incorporating a learning analytics approach into the cybersecurity exercise life-cycle. To facilitate this application, we have performed an extensive review of existing academic research on applying learning analytics in the context of cybersecurity exercises. We specifically focus on the learning indicators used to measure empirical impact and training effectiveness that could indicate achievement of defined learning outcomes. This reference model and overview of existing learning analytics use cases and learning metrics in various types of exercises can help educators, organisers and cyber range developers. This results in more adaptive exercise design and measurement using evidence-based data and connects digital learning traces to skills and competencies. cybersecurity. exercises. learning analytics. learning metrics. training 
Cybersecurity Deception Experimentation System.Cybersecurity deception research has had many successes in recent years. While early cyber deception systems (e.g., honeypots) were largely static, recent approaches leverage computational game theory and machine learning techniques to allow for dynamic deception strategies that can potentially observe, react, and adapt to an adversary in both the short and long term. However, applying these theoretical models and algorithms in real-world settings poses additional considerations that are not always apparent in theory. Currently, testbeds and experimentation platforms for dynamic deception are lacking, limiting the ability of researchers and analysts to test and evaluate these approaches using realistic scenarios and data.Honeypots are a technology where these dynamic deception methods can have a great impact on effectiveness. The basic technology to mimic nodes and network services has been used for several decades and is effective against less experienced adversaries, but is less useful against sophisticated intruders. Using adaptation, behavior-based model development and reasoning and other artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to make honeypots much more effective against experienced adversaries by making them less predictable and more targeted. Before these novel technologies can be used in the real world, it is critical that they are tested and validated on realistic systems and in realistic settings.We present the Cybersecurity Deception Experimentation System (CDES) that extends the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) to provide a platform that is capable of evaluating dynamic deception algorithms. We also provide three case studies that demonstrate how CDES can be used to practically implement dynamic honeypots in increasingly complex scenarios and discuss some nuances of each implementation.

Fuzzy-based Cybersecurity Risk Analysis of the Human Factor from the Perspective of Classified Information Leakage.Nowadays, the digital transformation of organizations is not a challenge but a must-have. In the spring of 2020, practically the whole world worked from home offices. Now digital adaptation is the challenge for many people and orgaization. This situation poses challenges for the cybersecurity world. At the time of writing this article, there is no exact data yet on what cybersecurity incidents have occurred or how much damage they have caused. Nevertheless, it is certain that in the pandemic chaos, many corporates made mistakes during their digital adaptation processes. To a considerable extent, these mistakes are due to humans. Even though there are outstanding technological solutions or regulations at a company, if this riskfactor is not appropriately managed, then the other two are worthless. Despite the need, there is no widespread human risk anylisys method in cybersecurity, because it is difficult to measure, and covered in obscurity. In this paper, the authors propose a fuzzy model to organizations whereby they can measure this risk if they have sufficient information about the workforce. The model will be easier understood if presented through a specific threat, the digital leakage of classified information from a critical infrastructure. classified information. critical infrastructure. cybersecurity. fuzzy model. human factor. information leakage 
Feature selection for deep neural networks in cyber security applications.To stay ahead of novel attacks, cyber security professionals are developing new software and systems using machine learning techniques. Neural network architectures improve such systems, e.g., IDS, by implementing anomaly detection, which differentiates benign packets from malicious packets. In order for an IDS to best predict anomalies, the data the model is trained on is typically pre-processed through normalization and feature selection/reduction. The impacts of pre-processing techniques play an important role in training a neural network to optimize its performance. This paper proposes a DNN with 2 hidden layers for the IDS architecture and compares two commonly used normalization pre-processing techniques. We find that using Z Score normalization increased performance in accuracy by 4.46% reduced loss by 2.04%, improved F-Score by 4.70%, and increased AUC-ROC by 23.64%.
Potential development on cyberattack and prospect analysis for cybersecurity.Technology and methods on cyberattack and strategy on cybersecurity always develop simultaneously. Once a knotty method of cyberattack has been created, information security specialists always react immediately and come up with a new security system that can prevent and eliminate the attack. Then, the hacker will try to find bugs from the system and perform alternative attacks. The war on security just never ends. The article tries to conclude our current information security environment and frontier battleground. The article is focused on some specific techniques such as machine learning and neural networks along with their applications on both the cyberattack side and cybersecurity side. The future predictions are made on how A.I. technology may change the current situation on information security. How attackers may use these technologies to steal user privacy and how a current security system should adapt to the evolution of cyberattack. Google has announced the realization of quantum supremacy on a quantum computer. As known, a quantum computer can solve problems required years with a current computer in seconds. This can be catastrophic to modern cryptology. The article discusses the problem and introduces potential reconstruction solutions on encryption. The ultimate goal of the article is to discuss the potentials with modern technology on information security and alarm people to be aware of these risks, also making predictions on how the future of information security will be like.

It involves increases in scale of an order of magnitude over the next decade, increasingly distributed and virtualized architectures, and an ever-changing perimeter. Cybersecurity analytic capability will need to adapt to meet the demands of this evolving environment. In this paper the authors assess the ways in which cybersecurity analytics will need to evolve and identify the potential role of Government in promoting needed changes. This paper provides a brief summary of that effort. Cybersecurity Analytics. IoT 
Toward Cybersecurity of Unmanned Aircraft System operations under Specific category.Nowadays, the increasing number of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations raises public concerns on cybersecurity issues. Therefore, it requires a methodology to address these issues during the UAS development. The Specific Operation Risk Assessment (SORA) is a risk assessment methodology developed by Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Aircraft System (JARUS). This methodology is endorsed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as an acceptable means to fulfill the requirements of EU regulation related to UAS operations under the Specific category. The original SORA methodology focus on Safety risk scenarios only, which relate to unintentional threats and the harms to people's life. In this paper, we introduce our solution to extend the methodology toward cybersecurity aspects. The extended methodology concerns risk scenarios relating to intentional digital threats and some other harms (e.g privacy violation, damage to critical infrastructure). A part of this solution is developed and is presented in this paper.
Cybersecurity of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). In recent years, UASs have become more and more popular. There are many reasons for this. one of the most popular is the enhancement of drones' functionalities and improvement in battery life, stabilization, navigation, sensor technology, and much more. The growth is driven by many benefits. However, as the number of drones is expanding and levels of their technological functionalities evolving, the use of drones brings a lot of concerns as well as challenges that should not be underestimated. This refers to issues in the area of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. UASs, under the international, regional, and national regime of aviation law, are considered aircraft. Since there is no existing cybersecurity framework for UASs, the civil aviation cybersecurity framework should apply to their operations. This paper will focus on the potential cyber threats against UASs, providing some examples of cyberattacks from the past. Further, the overview of the aviation cybersecurity framework will follow in order to determine the current status of maturity at the international and regional (European Union) levels. The conclusion of the paper will identify the necessary steps to be taken and potential solutions in terms of applying the aviation cybersecurity framework into the operation of UASs.

Cybercrime in Ukraine and the Cyber Security Game.This paper reviews some massive cyber-attacks in Ukraine. It demonstrates the scale and dynamics of cybercrime in Ukraine. Motivated by cybercrime we develop a two-player two-strategy matrix game between a defender that can either protect its strategic asset or leave it unprotected, and a defender that can either attack the defender's asset, or not. We assume that defending and attacking strategies are costly, and the value of the strategic asset is higher than are the costs of defending /attacking it. We show that under generic conditions on parameters the game has a single mixed Nash equilibrium. At this equilibrium the probability that the attacker will attack decreases with the value of the asset while the probability that the defender will actively defend increases. cyberattack. cybercrime.

Problem of Cybersecurity in Context of Medical Information System «register of Palliative Patients». The project of a special purpose medical information system for use in the field of palliative care 'Register of palliative patients' is proposed. The project provides that the system should have the following basic functionality: providing system administration. maintaining a patient register. searching for patient data by specified parameters. maintaining a patient's medical record including information about prescriptions. searching for prescriptions by specified parameters. generating summary reports and reports for a group of prescriptions. The prototype of the system, presented by its structural-functional and informational models, and its implementation are described. The cybersecurity issues of MISs are analyzed in terms of meeting regulatory requirements. An initial protection level of the «Palliative Patient Register» system was assessed, and the most relevant threats were identified to build a threat model. A scheme for ensuring information security was proposed. A model of data protection in the system based on the exchange of only anonymized personal data between the client and the server is proposed. To do this, we suggest using cryptographic security tools. The General scheme of interaction between the client and server using the REST architecture is described. The possibilities of the Yii framework for implementing the RestFull API are considered.
Expanding Cybersecurity Knowledge through an Indigenous Lens: A First Look.Decolonization and Indigenous education are at the forefront of Canadian content currently in Academia. Over the last few decades, we have seen some major changes in the way in which we share information. In particular, we have moved into an age of electronically-shared content, and there is an increasing expectation in Canada that this content is both culturally significant and relevant. In this paper, we discuss an ongoing community engagement initiative with First Nations communities in the Western Manitoba region. The initiative involves knowledge-sharing activities that focus on the topic of cybersecurity, and are aimed at a public audience. This initial look into our educational project focuses on the conceptual analysis and planning stage. We are developing a 'Cybersecurity 101' mini-curriculum, to be implemented over several one-hour long workshops aimed at diverse groups (these public workshops may include a wide range of participants, from tech-adverse to tech-savvy). Learning assessment tools have been built in to the workshop program. We have created informational and promotional pamphlets, posters, lesson plans, and feedback questionnaires which we believe instill relevance and personal connection to this topic, helping to bridge gaps in accessibility for Indigenous communities while striving to build positive, reciprocal relationships. Our methodology is to approach the subject from a community needs and priorities perspective. Activities are therefore being tailored to fit each community. We hope this will lead to increased awareness and engagement by community members. Two Indigenous student research assistants were hired to assist in this project, which has developed into a blend of community outreach on the topic of security and data protection (most notably with respect to social media and online banking) and a computing education student-led educational research project.

Elements of Networked Protection Systems for Distribution Networks and Microgrids: A Cyber-Security Perspective.Networked protection systems use information, communication and computation technologies to collect and process sensor data from spatially distributed sensors, and launch protective and control actions by sending commands to local devices. Such protection systems are also capable of supporting specialized tasks including asset control and backup protection in case of traditional relaying failures. This paper explains the structure and the fundamental elements of the networked protection systems in distribution systems and microgrids. The overall system is divided into three subsystems which are interconnected by communication systems. Different types of cyber-attacks on the subsystems and their impacts are discussed from the vantage point of protection. False and delayed tripping, non-detection, cascading failures, and unstable operation of distributed energy resources (DERs) are discussed as the critical issues that can be related to cyber-attacks.
Cyberspace threats: Not only hackers and criminals. Raising the awareness of selected unusual cyberspace actors - Cybersecurity researchers' perspective.Despite its development having changed and improved citizens' lives, cyberspace has also become a new arena for competition among states, organizations and individuals, and various cyber threats to people's security are becoming more prevalent, damaging and complex. Although it is rather commonly known that cyberspace is a battlefield, and almost every individual, organization or even state may fall victim to malicious hackers or greedy cybercriminals, the members of the public rarely seem to think of other sources of threat. Thus, in an attempt to raise the general awareness, this paper presents an additional number of selected, often unsuspected actors that shape and influence the cyberspace of today: nation-state actors, cyberterrorists, hacktivists and trolls. The motives of each actor, their modus operandi and the most significant representatives have also been discussed. Being aware of the existence and nature of each actor helps one better understand the threat they pose, as well as grasp the significance of the cybersecurity measures. Cyber threat. Cyberspace.

A case study on the representativeness of public DoS network traffic data for cybersecurity research.The availability of ready-to-use public security datasets is fostering measurement-driven research by a wide community of academics and practitioners. Recent trends in this area put forth a substantial body of literature on anomaly and attack detection on the top of public labelled datasets. Much of this literature blindly reuses existing datasets by overlooking the cybersecurity facets of the network traffic therein, in terms of its real impact on service availability and performance of operations. This paper addresses the representativeness of network traffic data provided by public datasets for cybersecurity research. To this aim, it proposes an initial exploration of the topic by means of a case study on Denial of Service (DoS) traffic of CICIDS2017, which is a recent dataset collected in a controlled environment that gained massive attention over the past two years. DoS traffic, which is available in CICIDS2017 in the form of packet data files, is replayed against a victim server in a controlled testbed. Measurements indicate that the DoS traffic, although somewhat relevant at network-level, has limited impact at application-level (i.e., by taking into account the performance of the victim under attack). The findings provide some key insights into the limitations of the data assessed in the study, paving the way for the construction of more rigorous datasets conceived with a multilayer perspective and that reflect actual traffic conditions under normative operations and disruptive attacks.

On the importance of cyber-security training for multi-vector energy distribution system operators.Multi-vector Energy Distribution Systems (EDS) are increasingly connected to provide new services to consumers and Distribution Network Operators (DNO). This exponential growth in connectivity, while beneficial, tremendously increases the attack surface of critical infrastructures, demonstrating a clear need for energy operator cyber-security training. This paper highlights the cyber-security challenges faced by EDS operators as well as the impact a successful cyber-attack could have on the grid. Finally, training needs are contextualised through cyber-attack examples. Cyber-security. Energy distribution system. Training 
Performance study of the robot operating system 2 with QoS and cyber security settings.Throughout the Department of Defense, there are ongoing efforts to increase cybersecurity and improve data transfer in unmanned robotic systems (UxS). This paper explores the performance of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, which is built with the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard as a middleware. Based on how quality of service (QoS) parameters are defined in the robotic middleware interface, it is possible to implement strict delivery requirements to different nodes on a dynamic nodal network with multiple unmanned systems connected. Through this research, different scenarios with varying QoS settings were implemented and compared to baseline values to help illustrate the impact of latency and throughput on data flow. DDS security settings were also enabled to help understand the cost of overhead and performance when secured data is compared to plaintext baseline values. Our experiments were performed using a basic ROS 2 network consisting of two nodes (one publisher and one subscriber). Our experiments showed a measurable latency and throughput change between different QoS profiles and security settings. We analyze the trends and tradeoffs associated with varying QoS and security settings. This paper provides performance data points that can be used to help future researchers and developers make informative choices when using ROS 2 for UxS. Robotic systems. ROS. Security.

A survey of contemporary cyber security vulnerabilities and potential approaches to automated defence.Western societies' technological superiority potentially serves as its principal vulnerability. As technology manifests itself into the fabric of our daily existence, our personal lives, economy, defense and security relies upon the internet and related technologies. The rapid adoption of advanced technologies since the early days of the internet in pursuit of low-cost dramatic improvements in efficiency, has driven our society to rely upon fragile automated systems. These were initially designed with the emphasis on openness, speed and efficiency as opposed to security as the core capability supporting much of our critical infrastructure. Traditional passive and reactive information security approaches are now incapable of serving as the sole means of protection and automated defensive measures are increasingly required. This paper examines the cyber threat to various critical automated systems and highlights potential approaches.
Exploration Study of Skillsets Needed in Cyber Security Field.Demands for professionals in the field of cyber security is high. In Malaysia, there is a huge shortage of skilled and qualified cyber security professionals. Diverse skill sets are required to keep up with the rapidly changing threat landscape. In order to meet future industry, many higher learning institutions in Malaysia offer many undergraduate and postgraduate cyber security programs. However, literature has reported that the lack of attention given between academia and industry appears when investigating their views concerning the skills gap. With growing numbers of cyber security attacks, it is crucial to develop a model that would guide both main stakeholders, industry, and academia to identify and prioritize skill sets needed to prepare students for the cyber security job market. This study will identify the required cyber security skillsets in preparing students for cyber security job market and develop a hierarchy structure for cyber security competency. The job position that is being reviewed is Information Security Analyst because it is the top job position for cyber security according to the literature review. All of the skills for information security analyst career are compared, and there are two skills reviewed which is soft skills and technical skills, including the various type of professional security certifications. This study developed a structured model for cyber security competency using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). analytical hierarchy process (AHP). cyber security skills.

Comparative Analysis on Student's Interest in Cyber Security among Secondary School Students using CTF Platform.In recent years, we see more degradation in the quality of cyber security graduates, especially in terms of not meeting the employer's perspective. They lack a certain amount of skills to be competent enough for the industry. This study aims to inculcate interest in cyber security at a younger age, specifically from secondary-level education. After exploring various methods of approaching this problem, Capture the Flag (CTF) has been chosen to introduce secondary school students to the cyber security competitive scene in the hope that they find fun factors to be more interested in the field of area. A one-day event was conducted with the implementation of the CTF competition at the end. A pre-test and post-test questionnaire were constructed and given to the participants to answer prior and after the event to measure any changes made to their view and interest of cyber security.

A Survey on Cybersecurity Challenges and Awareness for Children of all Ages.Children are considered an easy prey to many cybersecurity threats. This is due to the lack of awareness of such threats while using smart devices, like smartphones. In most of the cases, not only children but their parents are also unaware of these security threats. Therefore, in this research, we have performed a comprehensive survey on various aspects of cybersecurity threats and its awareness among children. Such as, online safety and security for children, security control challenges and cybersecurity challenges for children and parents. We have also performed a security test to demonstrate the effectiveness of built-in security and privacy settings of such devices. For this purpose, we have used the built-in security and privacy settings of an iPhone 11 and performed various usage tests on unrestricted and restricted mode. The tests and observations have proved that the built-in security and privacy controls, such as Screen Time or Parental Controls, are the most effective way to safeguard children from various Cybersecurity threats they may face during their use of such devices and lack of cybersecurity awareness. cyber security. information security. online safety. parental security controls. security and privacy. security awareness

Cyber Security in IoT communication (Internet of Things) on Smart Home.The Internet of Things (IoT) that are currently applied with the combination of smart devices that connect with each other devices over the Internet from smartphone to other household devices that are assembled in a smart home-based concept. Smart Home is one of the concepts of implementing IoT technology, which is the implementation of Software Engineering. However, in document requirements in its engineering process development, often the requirements for cyber security aspect is neglected because it is considered as a secondary requirement. Therefore, it will be done analysis process requirements on the system by specializing in the cyber security aspect. In this paper, it will be analyzed about cyber security requirements of smart home IoT communication using methodology of Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE). The methodology of cyber security requirements analysis use SQUARE methodology consisting of 9 stages consist of agreement, identification, development, and analysis. The identification and analysis that has been done also has resulted in security requirement along with the implementation required for a secure smart home system. The analysis result consists of four types of requirements such as Elicit Security Requirement, Categorize Requirement, Prioritize Requirement, and Requirement Inspection. It is very helpful in analyzing while providing recommendations to the security requirements of the system which are used to keep the availibility and continuity of the software as well as the integrity of the smart home systems that are being developed.
Enhancing cyber-security of distributed robust state estimation: Identification of data integrity attacks in multi-operator power system.State estimation (SE) has a crucial role to play in the monitoring and control of power grids. Although currently the SE is typically done in a centralized or hierarchical manner, distributed SE will become a significant alternative to centralized and hierarchical approaches in the future smart grids. This is because the power grids will be increasingly interconnected in future smart grids and the complexity scale of an interconnection will render centralized SE computationally formidable. Performing distributed SE requires leveraging advanced communication and computation technology. Nevertheless, relying on communication networks raises its susceptibility to data integrity attacks, such as false data injection (FDI) attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that the attacker who compromises the communication infrastructure can launch an FDI attack on distributed SE which could circumvent present robust estimators and bad data detectors. Afterwards, to effectively defense against the proposed FDI attack, two detection methods are proposed for two different modes of an interconnected power system. A detector is developed that validates the error of estimates of the state variables relative to their actual value as an index using a threshold value for different areas when the network is being run by an operator. A controlled information dissemination strategy is utilized to securely notify all areas of each other's proposed index when the network is being run by multiple operators. The proposed algorithms are validated on the IEEE 14-bus test system.
Cybersecurity enhancement of transformer differential protection using machine learning.The growing use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in power grid operational environments has been essential for operators to improve the monitoring, maintenance and control of power generation, transmission and distribution, however, at the expense of an increased grid exposure to cyber threats. This paper considers cyberattack scenarios targeting substation protective relays that can form the most critical ingredient for the protection of power systems against abnormal conditions. Disrupting the relays operations may yield major consequences on the overall power grid performance possibly leading to widespread blackouts. We investigate methods for the enhancement of substation cybersecurity by leveraging the potential of machine learning for the detection of transformer differential protective relays anomalous behavior. The proposed method analyses operational technology (OT) data obtained from the substation current transformers (CTs) in order to detect cyberattacks. Power systems simulation using OPAL-RT HYPERSIM is used to generate training data sets, to simulate the cyberattacks and to assess the cybersecurity enhancement capability of the proposed machine learning algorithms.

Cybersecurity analysis of distribution grid operation with distributed energy resources via co-simulation.As penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) continue to increase in power grids, many utilities have analyzed their impacts on grid operations. However, cybersecurity impacts of these DERs connecting to the grid have only begun to follow. Especially, analyzing how potential cybersecurity attacks manifest on the grid such as voltage stability and power flows requires modeling both communication network and power grid components, and co-simulating them. In pursuit of this effort, a cyber-physical co-simulation code base is developed to investigate the impact of cybersecurity attacks on distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS), using a communication network simulator (ns-3), a virtual machine emulator (QEMU), an IEEE 1815 communication protocol implementation (Opendnp3), a distribution grid simulator (GridLAB-D) and a hierarchical engine for large-scale infrastructure co-simulation (HELICS). A total of four cybersecurity attack scenarios on a DERMS that manages 20 solar photovoltaic generation inverters are simulated using two feeders of the City of Riverside Public Utilities in California, USA. The impact of the attacks on these feeders is analyzed. Co-simulation. Communication network. Cybersecurity. Power distribution system. Renewable energy 
Exploration of smart grid device cybersecurity vulnerability using shodan.The generation, transmission, distribution, and storage of electric power is becoming increasingly decentralized. Advances in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are rapidly changing the nature of the power grid. Moreover, the accommodation of these new technologies by the legacy grid requires that an increasing number of devices be Internet connected so as to allow for sensor and actuator information to be collected, transmitted, and processed. With the wide adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of smart grid devices that can potentially affect the stability, reliability, and resilience of the power grid need to be carefully examined and addressed. This is especially true in situations in which smart grid devices are deployed with default configurations or without reasonable protections against malicious activities. While much work has been done to characterize the vulnerabilities associated with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, this paper demonstrates that similar vulnerabilities associated with the newer class of IoT smart grid devices are becoming a concern. Specifically, this paper first performs an evaluation of such devices using the Shodan platform and text processing techniques to analyze a potential vulnerability involving the lack of password protection. This work further explores several Shodan search terms that can be used to identify additional smart grid components that can be evaluated in terms of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Finally, this paper presents recommendations for the more secure deployment of such smart grid devices. Cybersecurity. Power inverter. Shodan. Smart grid. Smart meter. Vulnerability

Artificial Intelligence Cyber Security Strategy.Nowadays, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) have never been treated so seriously before. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played an important role currently in STEM. Under the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic crisis, coronavirus disease across over the world we are living in. Every government seek advices from scientist before making their strategic plan. Most of countries collect data from hospitals (and care home and so on in the society), carried out data analysis, using formula to make some AI models, to predict the potential development patterns, in order to make their government strategy. AI security become essential. If a security attack make the pattern wrong, the model is not a true prediction, that could result in thousands life loss. The potential consequence of this non-accurate forecast would be even worse. Therefore, take security into account during the forecast AI modelling, step-by-step data governance, will be significant. Cyber security should be applied during this kind of prediction process using AI deep learning technology and so on. Some in-depth discussion will follow.AI security impact is a principle concern in the world. It is also significant for both nature science and social science researchers to consider in the future. In particular, because many services are running on online devices, security defenses are essential. The results should have properly data governance with security. AI security strategy should be up to the top priority to influence governments and their citizens in the world. AI security will help governments' strategy makers to work reasonably balancing between technologies, socially and politics. In this paper, strategy related challenges of AI and Security will be discussed, along with suggestions AI cyber security and politics trade-off consideration from an initial planning stage to its near future further development.

Design and Implementation of Full-Scale Industrial Control System Test Bed for Assessing Cyber-Security Defenses.In response to the increasing awareness of the Ethernet-based threat surface of industrial control systems (ICS), both the research and commercial communities are responding with ICS-specific security solutions. Unfortunately, many of the properties of ICS environments that contribute to the extent of this threat surface (e.g. age of devices, inability or unwillingness to patch, criticality of the system) similarly prevent the proper testing and evaluation of these security solutions. Production environments are often too fragile to introduce unvetted technology and most organizations lack test environments that are sufficiently consistent with production to yield actionable results. Cost and space requirements prevent the creation of mirrored physical environments leading many to look towards simulation or virtualization. Examples in literature provide various approaches to building ICS test beds, though most of these suffer from a lack of realism due to contrived scenarios, synthetic data and other compromises. In this paper, we provide a design methodology for building highly realistic ICS test beds for validating cybersecurity defenses. We then apply that methodology to the design and building of a specific test bed and describe the results and experimental use cases. cyber security. industrial control systems. test beds

Finding a safe port: Cyber-security analysis for open source digital library software.This article presents the results of an investigation into how safe, from a cyber-security standpoint, our Open Source Digital Library (DL) systems are. The fact that these systems use open source software presents particular challenges in terms of securely running a web-based digital repository, as a malicious user has the added advantage that they can study the source code to the system to establish new vectors of attack, in addition to the many well documented black-box forms of web hacking. To scope the work reported we focused on two widely used digital library systems: DSpace and Greenstone, undertaking both Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), in addition to more traditional port scans. We summarize the deficiencies found and detail how to make improvements to both systems to make them more secure. We conclude by reflecting more broadly on the forms of security concerns found, to help inform future development of DL software architectures. Cyber-security. Digital library software.

Exploring Participants' Views of Cybersecurity Competitions through the Lens of Social Media.Cybersecurity competitions have been recognized as a great approach to enhancing cybersecurity education. As the industry fights to solve the cybersecurity workforce shortage, various cybersecurity competitions have been developed. Although several studies have investigated the characteristics of the competition participants based on self-reported data, there remains a great need to gain a better understanding of the participants' views from an objective standpoint. In this study, we investigate the participants' comments, interests, and engagement based on the evidence collected from multiple social media platforms, including Reddit, Twitter, and Google Trends. Given the collected data, we conducted a content analysis to identify popular topics discussed in Reddit communities through the use of coding. Additionally, we analyzed Twitter and Google Trends data to investigate the trends of people's interests and sentiment of multiple aspects. Our analysis results enable us to discuss several practical implications of the findings. Cybersecurity Competitions. Data Analytic. Human Factors. Social Media

AutoSec: Multidimensional timing-based anomaly detection for automotive cybersecurity.Nowadays, autonomous driving and driver assistance applications are being developed at an accelerated pace. This rapid growth is primarily driven by the potential of such smart applications to significantly improve safety on public roads and offer new possibilities for modern transportation concepts. Such indispensable applications typically require wireless connectivity between the vehicles and their surroundings, i.e. roadside infrastructure and cloud services. Nevertheless, such connectivity to external networks exposes the internal systems of individual vehicles to threats from remotely-launched attacks. In this realm, it is highly crucial to identify any misbehavior of the software components which might occur owing to either these threats or even software/hardware malfunctioning. In this paper, we introduce AutoSec, a host-based anomaly detection algorithm which relies on observing four timing parameters of the executed software components to accurately detect malicious behavior on the operating system level. To this end, AutoSec formulates the task of detecting anomalistic executions as a clustering problem. Specifically, AutoSec devises a hybrid clustering algorithm for grouping a set of collected timing traces resulted from executing the legitimate code. During the runtime, AutoSec simply classifies a certain execution as an anomaly, if its timing parameters are distant enough from the boundaries of the predefined clusters. To show the effectiveness of AutoSec, we collected timing traces from a testbed composed of a set of real and virtual control units communicating over a CAN bus. We show that using our proposed AutoSec, compared to baseline methods, we can identify up to 21% less false positives and 18% less false negatives. Anomaly Detection. DBSCAN Classifiers.

Cybersecurity Analysis for the Communication Protocol in Smart Grids.Smart Grids are smart electrical networks that use communication technologies to service the power grid. They are an interconnected, self-detecting-adjusting-correcting network of distributed loads and generators. The Substation Automation lies at the heart of Smart Grids, and IEC 61850 is an innovative communication and automation standard within Smart Grids substations. This study aims to explore a cybersecurity analysis of the communication protocols recommended under the IEC 61850 standard, namely GOOSE messaging protocol. GOOSE messaging has been chosen as the candidate protocol for testing due to its increasing prevalence in the standard and adoption by industry. Relevant attack vectors have then been investigated. Finally, this study demonstrated that GOOSE messages are vulnerable to a variety of attack vectors, such as Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, which leave the systems prone to spurious operations or faulty tripping. communication protocol. cybersecurity. goose protocol.

Cyber security meets big knowledge: Towards a secure HACE theorem.The HACE Theorem has emerged as a way to characterize big data. Over the years it has become fundamental to big data characterization as the Newton's Laws are to Physics. Associated with the HACE theorem is the Big Data Processing Framework for storing, managing, analyzing and sharing massive amounts of heterogenous, autonomous and distributed data with complex and evolving relationships. This paper examines the security and privacy aspects for the HACE theorem. It argues that what is needed is a Policy-Aware Big Data Processing Framework for the collection, storage, management, mining, and sharing of the massive amounts of data. It also examines knowledge graphs to represent the big data and determines ways to reason about the graphs and yet maintain security and privacy. Big Knowledge. HACE. Knowledge Graphs.

Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence for Cloud-based Internet of Transportation Systems.The Internet of Things (IoT) has major implications in the transportation industry. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) aim at improving day-To-day activities such as delivering packages, improving traffic, and the transportations of goods. AVs are not limited to ground vehicles but also include aerial and sea vehicles with a wide range of applications. The IoT systems consisting of a collection of AVs have come to be known as the Internet of Transportation systems. While such IoT systems manage large quantities of sensor data, much of the data is also sent to a cloud for offline analysis. While there is great potential in AVs and the improvements it can make to the transportation industry, security and privacy concerns pose new challenges that need to be addressed as we move forward. In addition, Artificial Intelligence techniques are also becoming crucial for such IoT systems to be able to intelligently manage the AVs. This paper discusses AI and security for cloud-based Internet of Transportation Systems. AI. Artificial Intelligence. Cloud Internet of Transportation. Cyber Security 
A Lightweight Cyber-Security Defense Framework for Smart Homes.Inevitably, the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has alerted the modern human life. Apart from the benefits that this new technology offers to the users of the IoT devices, there are also dangers related to Cyber Security. Traditional methodologies that support and strengthen the Cyber Security can not be applied to the low consumption IoT devices. Hence, many attack detection methodologies and systems that respect the constraints of the IoT have been presented recently. In this paper, an anomaly detection mechanism is proposed that focuses on the threat detection, by combining statistical and machine learning methodologies to detect abnormalities in time-series of the network traffic. Moreover, this new framework is a lightweight Cyber Security solution, since its computational logic is included in the edge layer. The results of the experiments that were conducted in a test bed, indicated the high performance of the methodology in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure. Anomaly Detection.

A three-year retrospective on offering an embedded systems course with a focus on cybersecurity.The fast pace of advancement in fields of computer science and engineering creates enormous opportunities for the use and application of computing devices. The internet of things (IoT) constitutes an area experiencing significant growth. If IoT systems are not configured and used correctly, there is potential for widespread disruption and harm due to cyberattacks. Hence, the new generation of professionals in the field of computer technology needs to be conversant with cybersecurity and the design of protection of computer systems. Cybersecurity is not restricted to a specific domain such as hardware or software and needs to address all aspects of operation of computer systems. Consequently, we have found it beneficial to introduce students to cybersecurity through an embedded systems course. Based on three years of teaching cybersecurity to students in an embedded systems course, we observe that students are excited and motivated to participate in hands-on lab exercises. We have taken special care to orient these lab exercises to breaking news articles about developments related to safety and cybersecurity. We also found it helpful to unify multiple lab exercises around a specific target application domain such as healthcare or retail. Our results over a three-year period demonstrate that it is possible to teach essential cybersecurity concepts within a one-semester course to students who do not have prior exposure to this area. This knowledge needs to be expanded upon in other courses, thereby weaving a thread of cybersecurity through the students' educational experience. curricular development. databases. embedded systems. hands-on experience. internet-of-Things 
Towards Secure Application Development: A Cyber Security Centred Holistic Approach.As technology becomes increasingly intertwined with our lives, the adoption of secure development lifecycles- methodologies that aim to embed good security practices into the development process-become more and more important. The ability of secure development lifecycles to reduce the risk of cyber attacks should make them a valuable tool, integral to any organisation that develops new technologies. However, the practicality of secure development lifecycles remains unclear and there is evidence to suggest that their adoption is limited. Consequently, this paper considers the challenges secure development lifecycles present to organisations. More specifically, it considers whether the lack of automation, integration, and secure development approaches limit its adoption. Furthermore, a holistic approach to secure development is explored as a means to overcome the aforementioned challenges. cyber security. internet of things. secure development lifecyle. security framework. systems security 
An Intelligent Learning Method and System for Cybersecurity Threat Detection.To protect information system and data effectively is the core of cybersecurity. At present, most technologies are based on known static protection strategies. Through the cybersecurity threat is dynamic, so it is necessary to detect the cybersecurity in advance, so as to update the protection strategy in time, which means the dynamic and active defence. The intelligent learning method and system for cybersecurity threat detection is proposed. And the immune selection of cybersecurity threat detection is proposed to select the appropriate threshold, and the knowledge map of cybersecurity threat detection are constructed from suspicious time, security management centre, security computing environment, security area boundary and security communication network. The threshold is built by immune selection, and the cybersecurity intelligent detection can be achieved by knowledge map. The architecture of intelligent detection system is proposed. So that the cybersecurity threat detection can be dynamic and intelligent, and the performance of cybersecurity threat detection and analysis can be greatly improved.

Hacked time: Design and evaluation of a self-efficacy based cybersecurity game.A major reason why people don't use security tools online is that they perceive them as difficult and challenging, resulting in the lack of self-efficacy. Previous research has looked at improving user security attitude and practices through a variety of interventions, including transformational games. These games, targeted at improving security attitude and promoting change through gameplay, offer a new perspective on cybersecurity education. In this research we present the design and evaluation of Hacked Time, a desktop game that uses an integrative approach that incorporates Bandura's self-efficacy design framework to improve player self-efficacy. Using a randomized control trial (n=178), we demonstrate that our game is effective in improving player's security attitude and self-efficacy for using cybersecurity tools. We discuss how our design pattern can serve as an exemplar to enhance player self-efficacy in other fields. cybersecurity. game design. games. self-efficacy 
Cloud based cyber security defense of smart meters.In Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), smart meters (SM) implement encryption with Embedded Secure Access Module (ESAM) to implement secure communication. However, it may be attacked by malicious adversaries once the ESAM is cracked. Since SM has limited communication and computing resources and cannot detect malicious code, a cloud based cyber security protection approach is proposed to detect malware online. Firstly, the closed and fixed operating environment is utilized to establish and maintain a white list of legal processes in the cloud security server. Thereafter, the malware detection agent is installed in SM, and all operating processes are enumerated by it. The hash code of each process can be calculated as its identity and submitted to the cloud security server. The SM with malware could be identified by comparing it with the whitelist. SM needs only calculate and upload hash code of processes, which is affordable to SM with limited computing & communication resources. The proposed approach can help harden cyber security defense of AMI. Cloud. Cyber Security. Meter 
Research on Cybersecurity Risk Assessment in SCADA Networks Based on AHP-RSR.Due to the increase in demand and use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, it is crucial to provide a risk assessment for ensuring the normal operation of these industrial systems. In this paper, a novel approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Rank-Sum Ratio (RSR) is proposed to reduce the subjectivity and uncertainty of risk assessment, quantitatively and comprehensively assess the security risk level in SCADA networks. Furthermore, this method is able to shorten the time of identifying risks after the occurrence of cyber threats. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach is effective for relative risk evaluation for SCADA systems. AHP-RSR. industrial control systems. network security. risk assessment.

Cybersecurity attacks on smart home during Covid-19 pandemic.COVID-19 has generated that dynamics in the context of cybersecurity change significantly, due to the displacing of activities of organizations in the city to home in telework mode. The cybersecurity architecture at home does not have the same levels of security as in organizations, even more if the house has been developed under a smart infrastructure (smart home) scheme, the cybersecurity attack surface expands. This context could be one of the reasons why the number of attacks has increased significantly to more than 35%. VPN solutions are uses to protect telecommuting communications but security attacks exploit vulnerabilities of home-equipment and people, so VPN solutions could reduce their efficiency. Attackers have focused on social engineering attacks that use the concerns generated by the covid-19 pandemic to be more effective in their attacks. This study presents an analysis of cybersecurity attacks that have appeared during this pandemic and how it forces to change defense strategies in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. Phishing. Smart city.

Hierarchical deep learning for cybersecurity of critical service systems.The costs of delivering critical services, such as healthcare, power, financial systems and transportation are spiraling up while the performance expectations of them have risen manifold. The mechanics of providing these services (e.g., activities like processing satellite imagery for defense and civil applications, analyzing patient data for diagnosing acute ailments, ensuring uneventful working of unmanned vehicles and big data analytics for sustaining smart cities) all require unprecedented data acquisition, storage, computation and communication. Driven by the need to achieve agility, intelligence and high performance at lower cost and improve outcomes, these systems are increasingly relying on advanced methods and technologies. Trends show the prevalence of IoT for data collection, multi-cloud computing for storage and analytics and virtualization of communication components. The increasing sophistication of technology also increases susceptibility of these systems to cyberattacks. The overarching objective of the work presented in this paper is to show the feasibility and usefulness of AI-based hierarchical sparse deep neural network models for providing security to data in motion. The novelty of the work lies in the use of variable complexity models across multiple clouds and their synergistic training to reduce training time and improve detection accuracy for unknown attacks.

Learning Environment Containerization of Machine Leaning for Cybersecurity.Machine learning plays a critical role in detecting and preventing in the field of cybersecurity. However, many students have difficulties on configuring the appropriate coding environment and retrieving datasets on their own computers, which, to some extent, wastes valuable time for learning core contents of machine learning and cybersecurity. In this paper, we propose an approach with learning environment containerization of machine learning algorithm and dataset. This will help students focus more on learning contents and have valuable hand-on experience through Docker container and get rid of the trouble of configuration coding environment and retrieve dataset.

Black Box Attacks on Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI) methods in Cyber Security. Cybersecurity community is slowly leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to combat ever evolving threats. One of the biggest drivers for successful adoption of these models is how well domain experts and users are able to understand and trust their functionality. As these black-box models are being employed to make important predictions, the demand for transparency and explainability is increasing from the stakeholders.Explanations supporting the output of ML models are crucial in cyber security, where experts require far more information from the model than a simple binary output for their analysis. Recent approaches in the literature have focused on three different areas: (a) creating and improving explainability methods which help users better understand the internal workings of ML models and their outputs. (b) attacks on interpreters in white box setting. (c) defining the exact properties and metrics of the explanations generated by models. However, they have not covered, the security properties and threat models relevant to cybersecurity domain, and attacks on explainable models in black box settings.In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a taxonomy for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, covering various security properties and threat models relevant to cyber security domain. We design a novel black box attack for analyzing the consistency, correctness and confidence security properties of gradient based XAI methods. We validate our proposed system on 3 security-relevant data-sets and models, and demonstrate that the method achieves attacker's goal of misleading both the classifier and explanation report and, only explainability method without affecting the classifier output. Our evaluation of the proposed approach shows promising results and can help in designing secure and robust XAI methods. Adversarial Attack. Cyber security. deep learning.

Learning Word Representation for the Cyber Security Vulnerability Domain.There have been ever-increasing amounts of security vulnerabilities discovered and reported in recent years. Much of the information related to these vulnerabilities is currently available to the public, in the form of rich, textual data (e.g. vulnerability reports). Many of the state-of-the-art techniques used today to process such textual data rely on so-called word embeddings. As of today, several pre-trained embeddings have been created, many of which rely on general-purpose training datasets such as Google News and Wikipedia. More recently, other domain-specific word embeddings have been created (e.g. in the context of software development) to cope with terminology and ambiguity limitations of existing general-purpose embeddings. The availability of word embeddings for specialised domains is critical for the effectiveness of domain-specific tasks that rely on this technique. In this paper, we propose a word embedding for the cyber security vulnerability domain. We train our embedding model on multiple, rich and heterogeneous security vulnerability information sources publicly available on the web. The benefits of such specialised word embedding are demonstrated through a qualitative comparison of word similarity and the exemplary task of matching security professionals to vulnerability discovery tasks posted to bug bounty programs. We also introduce a new dataset of words pairs similarity with a human judgement that can be used as a benchmark. Our experimental results show that, in the context of cyber security, our domain-specific word embedding outperforms existing pre-trained embeddings built on general-purpose and software engineering datasets. crowdsourcing.

Opportunities and Challenges of Data-Driven Cybersecurity for Smart Cities.To enhance the quality of life for city residents, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is used along with additional new technologies to create smart cities. Smart cities also facilitate efficient utilization of the city resources and improve adaptability and sustainability. There are different applications supporting smart cities for smart energy systems, smart water networks, smart transportation systems, smart healthcare and smart public safety and security. While these applications provide several benefits, cybersecurity threats can be a major obstacle in realizing these benefits. In this study, we review the cybersecurity challenges in smart city applications. Then, we investigate using a data-driven cybersecurity approach to protect smart city applications. We identify and discuss the opportunities and challenges of utilizing the data-driven approach. Currently there are research efforts and publications discussing cybersecurity issues in smart city applications. However, none of them focus on data-driven cybersecurity approaches. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper include identifying potential smart city applications, identifying and discussion the benefits and opportunities of using the data-driven approach and outlining the challenges of applying it for securing smart city applications. cybersecurity. data-driven security. security protection techniques. smart city

Pedagogical challenges and ethical considerations in developing critical thinking in cybersecurity.The online world of today offers both possibilities and challenges, increasingly requiring critical thinking to distinguish between truth and lies. One has to tell the real news and videos from the fake ones at election campaigns, to distinguish fake online shops from the real ones, and recognize catfishing attempts in budding relationships. The aim of our paper is to discuss pedagogical and ethical challenges online, using the deliberately created fake accounts as a tool to teach students critical thinking and other digital survival skills. In 2018 and 2019 we carried out an exercise for M.Sc. students (a 50 in each year) involving the creation of fake accounts based on prescribed data. We mapped the developed skills and knowledge, analyzing the legal and ethical aspects of the process (also involving external experts, e.g. physical and cybersecurity specialists, lawyers, educational technologists). We conclude that fake accounts as a learning tool can be a powerful measure to activate new ways of 'out of the box' thinking necessary for both cybersecurity experts and common citizens in an information society.

AI in cybersecurity education-a systematic literature review of studies on cybersecurity moocs.Machine learning (ML) techniques are changing both the offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity. The implications are especially strong for privacy, as ML approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to make use of collected data. Thus, education on cybersecurity and AI is needed. To investigate how AI and cybersecurity should be taught together, we look at previous studies on cybersecurity MOOCs by conducting a systematic literature review. The initial search resulted in 72 items and after screening for only peer-reviewed publications on cybersecurity online courses, 15 studies remained. Three of the studies concerned multiple cybersecurity MOOCs whereas 12 focused on individual courses. The number of published work evaluating specific cybersecurity MOOCs was found to be small compared to all available cybersecurity MOOCs. Analysis of the studies revealed that cybersecurity education is, in almost all cases, organised based on the topic instead of used tools, making it difficult for learners to find focused information on AI applications in cybersecurity. Furthermore, there is a gab in academic literature on how AI applications in cybersecurity should be taught in online courses. AI. Cybersecurity. Machine learning. mOOC.

A new approach to fuzzy regular expression parsers for cybersecurity logs.As we move towards a zero-trust environment, collaborative intelligent systems are a vital tool in the cybersecurity workflow. These intelligent systems need to receive accurate and complete information from the multiplicity of low-level network monitoring systems. Typically, these low-level systems use regular expressions which are fast but not robust against minor changes - thus, information is often discarded. This paper outlines a new approach to low-level parsers, able to suggest new regular expression sequences and deal with approximate matching in an efficient way. Cybersecurity.

Simulation Modeling of Strapdown Inertial Navigation Systems Functioning as a Means to Ensure Cybersecurity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Navigation Systems for Dynamic Objects in Various Correction Modes.In this paper the problem of simulation of strapdown inertial navigation systems functioning as an option to strengthen UAV resilience against attacks on the objects' positioning subsystems is considered. Although strapdown inertial navigation system is the basis of the UAV navigation, its readings need to be corrected. Readings of the Global Navigation Satellite System is the main means of correction, but its signals may be unavailable if a cyberattack occurs. This work considers a multi-factor strapdown inertial navigation system correction model, including through Global Navigation Satellite System and other means of correction, and this model is more resistant to cyberattacks. Qualitative assessments of imitation modelling results are presented in order to analyze the properties of developed algorithms of integrated processing of information from strapdown inertial navigation systems.
What happens in a control room during a cybersecurity attack?: Preliminary observations from a pilot study.Cyberattacks on the critical infrastructure is a growing concern for businesses, national authorities and public in general. The increasing complexity and connectivity of the critical infrastructure systems have made them susceptible to cyberattacks. The traditional notion of safety systems being isolated is no longer applicable, as we have seen ample examples on how these systems can be exploited through gaps in e.g. supply chain, physical security, insiders. This places greater importance on how the staff belonging to owners and operators of these critical infrastructure, e.g. operators, IT/security personnel, system engineers, management, are prepared to handle cyberattacks. This paper presents our ongoing research on investigating the preparedness of organisations to handle cybersecurity incidents and providing holistic solutions to improve cybersecurity posture. We present one experiment that has been conducted using our cybersecurity centre and man-machine laboratory to study how operators and security team of a power plant will handle a cyberattack. We highlight the main observations made through this experiment. Control room. Critical Infrastructure. Cybersecurity. Human factors. Incident Response. Safety 
Specific Air Traffic Management Cybersecurity Challenges: Architecture and Supply Chain. Cybsersecurity is without doubt becoming a societal challenge. It even starts to affect sectors that were not considered to be at risk in the past because of their relative isolation. One of these sectors is aviation in general, and specifically air traffic management (ATM). New developments in technology and the - -ever increasing - -trend to interconnect systems have drastically changed this landscape. Like many safety relevant sectors, the general attitude in aviation is rather conservative. Safety practitioners prefer slow changes, which conflicts with the  rapid response requirements coming from the (cyber)security area. Air traffic management systems are large socio-technical systems, a fact that adds an additional dimension to the cybersecurity complexity. In this paper I will address a subset of sector specific challenges that we have to address in the ATM domain. The number of challenges is quite substantial and topics like security policies, risk assessment methodologies and vulnerabilities in specific areas (e.g. ADS-B) can be found in the literature. This paper will look at two challenges that have received, so far, less attention: architecture and supply chain. air traffic management. architecture. cybersecurity. supply chain

An initial look into the computer science and cybersecurity pathways project for career and technical education curricula.Computer science and cybersecurity have gained the attention of various stakeholders, industry representatives, educators, parents and students who are thinking about their future careers. Teaching computer science courses has moved into K-12 education, no longer introduced in the college classroom. There are various reasons for this trend. One is that in this way more children have access to the curriculum that integrates computer science principles, not just those undergraduate students in specific STEM majors. Other industries need different levels of computer science and cybersecurity education. There are various programs across the nation that are focusing on introducing these topics as early as elementary school through various outreach programs or even in the regular curriculum. In 2014, Governor Terry McAuliffe (Commonwealth of Virginia) established the Cyber Virginia and the Virginia Cyber Security Commission with recommendations that a cybersecurity workforce pipeline should start in K-12 education and that various pathways should be developed and implemented across the Commonwealth. This paper will provide an initial look into a project funded by the Department of Education that is focused on the Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathways in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. It is the first year of implementation.
Evaluation of the second year of a reu program on cyber-physical system cybersecurity.The North Dakota State University operated a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored research experience for undergraduates (REU) program during the summers of 2018 and 2019. This paper presents the results of this program for the second year of operations (in 2019) and compares them to the results from the prior year. It provides an overview of the program and the changes made between the two years. It also discusses the different research topics that students worked on during both years of program participation. The benefits that students sought and attained are also reviewed.
Work in Progress: Comparison of 'boot camp' and traditional academic course delivery for cybersecurity education.The need for quality cybersecurity education is growing rapidly due to a significant level of current unfilled demand, which is growing rapidly, for cybersecurity professionals [1]. This demand was created and is driven by the ever-increasing rate of technology implementation in mission-critical roles throughout industry, governments, and society. Due, in part, to this need and for a variety of other reasons, numerous non-collegiate cybersecurity offerings have been launched [2]. Many of these programs promise to offer the education and career prospects of a 2-year or 4-year degree in a matter of weeks or months. While the focus is somewhat different and these programs do not offer the well-rounded background of a collegiate degree, they do raise a question of the comparative efficacy of different approaches for providing cybersecurity instruction. This work seeks to answer the question of how educators can best meet the growing demand for cybersecurity professionals. It compares the learning outcomes of a cybersecurity course offered in a traditional three credit hour classroom lecture setting over one academic semester to an immersive 80-hour workshop environment offered as two 40-hour weeks of instruction, lab work and facilitated assignments. The paper describes the study which includes comparative assessment of students in both environments. The work considers both the outcomes achieved and student satisfaction with the learning process. The study includes pre- and post-tests for both formats. Also, students in both environments are surveyed before and after the cybersecurity education experience to evaluate students' perceptions of the education environment's impact on their performance. The results are compared between the two groups. Initial efforts of this work are presented and topics for ongoing and prospective future work are discussed.
Partnership to prepare students for careers in the emerging field of cybersecurity.Cybersecurity is an emerging field with significant implications as the use of interconnected devices increases. Each device represents a potential entry point for individuals with malicious intentions. A direct result of the growth of the number of Internet connected devices and the inherent security risks is the need for more individuals trained in the field of cybersecurity and related operational technologies. Presented in this paper is the development and implementation of the RELLIS Cybersecurity Alliance and the programs offered. Included is the new bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, which was developed from a 'clean sheet.' Also presented are the initial professional development courses being offered. The physical laboratory spaces that have been purpose-built enabling students to obtain hands-on experience as part of the academic and professional development programs are also discussed. A strong component in the development of each of these pieces was the active involvement the public and private sector.
Interdisciplinary cybersecurity projects experience: Developing a market ready workforce. The increasing advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 inspires more connectivity of vital infrastructure to the cloud. Securing our infrastructure digital and control systems is currently a crucial demand in a cyber-world characterized by continuous cybersecurity attacks. Preparing qualified students to satisfy the current and future work force requirement in cybersecurity is deemed essential. One of the main cybersecurity domain challenges is its interdisciplinary nature that involves scientists, engineers, technologists, and business teams. It is almost impossible in real life to mitigate threats and defend against attacks without assembling teams and qualified team members with skills in all the aforementioned disciplines. This paper aims at presenting the plan and procedures required for creating an project based interdisciplinary course at cybersecurity of frontier technologies between the College of Engineering, College of Science, and College of Business Administration. The course objective is to bring students from the three disciplines into a multidisciplinary experience that aids students at replicating real life projects. Instructors from all three disciplines guide the students during the course work and supervise the project activities. The fifteen-week course can adopt different types of cybersecurity systems and provide a framework for students' collaboration on a practical project. The framework consists of four modules divided between the three disciplines: 1) project scope, system integration, and teamwork incorporation. 2) system engineering, cybersecurity design, and application development. 3) system cybersecurity algorithms, data collection, organization, and analytics. 4) system business planning, cybersecurity applications operations implementation, and maintenance. The paper also presents an example for an IoT based project to apply the framework and show the projected course model in developing the IoT project.
Training and teaching students and IT professionals on high-throughput networking and cybersecurity using a private cloud.This paper describes the deployment of a private cloud and the development of virtual laboratories and companion material to teach and train engineering students and Information Technology (IT) professionals in high-throughput networks and cybersecurity. The material and platform, deployed at the University of South Carolina, are also used by other institutions to support regular academic courses, self-pace training of professional IT staff, and workshops across the country. The private cloud is used to deploy scenarios consisting of high-speed networks (up to 50 Gbps), multi-domain environments emulating internetworks, and infrastructures under cyber-attacks using live traffic. For regular academic courses, the virtual laboratories have been adopted by institutions in different states to supplement theoretical material with hands-on activities in IT, electrical engineering, and computer science programs. Topics include Local Area Networks (LANs), congestion-control algorithms, performance tools used to emulate wide area networks (WANs) and their attributes (packet loss, reordering, corruption, latency, jitter, etc.), data transfer applications for high-speed networks, queueing delay and buffer size in routers and switches, active monitoring of multi-domain systems, high-performance cybersecurity tools such as Zeek's intrusion detection systems, and others. The training platform has been also used by IT professionals from more than 30 states, for self-pace training. The material provides training on topics beyond general-purpose networks, which are usually overlooked by practitioners and researchers. Additionally, the platform has supported workshops organized across the country. Workshops are co-organized with organizations that operate large backbone networks connecting research centers and national laboratories, and colleges and universities conducting teaching and research activities.
Hands-on cybersecurity curriculum using a modular training kit.There is an exponential growth in the number of cyber-attack incidents resulting in significant financial loss and national security concerns. Secure cyberspace has been designated as one of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges in engineering. Broadly, the security threats are targeted on software programs, operating system and network with the intention to launch confidentiality, integrity and availability violations. Existing undergraduate and graduate-level cybersecurity education curriculum rely primarily on didactic teaching methods with little focus on student centered, inquiry-based teaching, known to improve student learning. With growing number of security incidents taking place, it is of utmost importance to prepare a workforce equipped with knowledge of the threat space and existing state-of-the-art solutions. Such comprehensive understanding is only possible by a dedicated hands-on course on cybersecurity where students can learn the key concepts by editing the hardware, software and OS, and, network policies. Unfortunately, such extensive and deep flexibilities are not provided in current cybersecurity curriculum. In this paper, we introduce a hands-on and modular self-learning Cybersecurity Training (CST) Kit to advance cybersecurity education. Students can promptly apply newly acquired knowledge on the CST Kit as part of the learning process. This Kit accompanies Do-It-Yourself (DIY) training modules that is used to model and investigate cybersecurity issues and their prevention to all levels of the cybersecurity workforce, including undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 science and technology teachers. The Kit also covers various aspects of cybersecurity issues including, hardware, software, operating system and network security. A coursework has been developed on hardware security for senior undergraduate and graduate students using the Kit. A preliminary survey conducted among students who were introduced to the modular board to implement hardware security threats such as, side-channel attack shows an 120% improvement in their understanding after the CST Kit based activities. The components of the CST Kit have also been used in a 4-day summer workshop for K-12 teachers. Teachers took pre- and post- concept inventories to assess their learning of content throughout the workshop and the results indicated improvement of 58%. These assessments focused on vulnerabilities and specific types of attacks, system security, data transmission and encryption, permutations and combinatorics, and binary numbers.

Cybersecurity, digital forensics, and mobile computing: Building the pipeline of next-generation university graduates through focused high school summer camps. To prepare the next generation of skilled university graduates that would help in filling the national need for cybersecurity, digital forensics, and mobile computing professionals, a team of minority/under-represented graduate students, the University Upward Bound Program (a federally funded program and part of the U.S. Department of Education. one of 967 programs nationwide) staff, and faculty from the Computer Science (CS) department got together and proposed a focused 10-week long funded summer camp for two local high schools with the following objectives: 1. Provide graduate students to instruct in the areas of` mobile application development, forensics and cyber Security. 2. Provide CS one-on-one mentors for students while conducting their work-based learning experience in Computer Science. 3. Assign hands-on interdisciplinary projects that emphasize the importance of STEM fields when using and developing software applications. 4. Promote and develop soft skills among participants including leadership, communications skills, and teamwork. The proposal was funded, by DOE and the summer camps were conducted in the summer of 2019 with participation of more than 40 students from two local high schools. The paper will present our efforts in each of the above areas: 1. The criteria/application/selection of high school student based on interest and needs. 2. The criteria/specification for purchased equipment 3. The selection and hiring of graduate students as instructors who can not only teach, but also serve as role models for the incoming students. 4. The development of course material into two parts: foundational material required by everyone, and specialized material where the student selects his/her area of interest. Presented results will show how the summer-camps benefited the students through the focused instruction given by graduate students, and how the students gained valuable knowledge and problem-solving skills in certain STEM fields. 5. The mentorship provided by the CS faculty to the instructors and the students through scheduled visits and an agile approach for the software projects assigned. 6. The development of soft skills to complement technical ones By presenting our study, we hope that other institutions who are considering summer camps can benefit from our experience by adopting best practices while avoiding pitfall.

Work in Progress: The role of student counselors at cybersecurity summer camps.The goal of cybersecurity summer camps is to excite students about cybersecurity and to provide students the opportunity to learn about cybersecurity and related computational science skills. For example, student campers can learn about programming, networks and the Internet. Most importantly, they learn how cybersecurity is deeply interwoven into everyday life. This last summer, 70 high school students participated in the week-long cybersecurity summer camp event at North Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota. The cybersecurity summer camp curriculum is facilitated by junior counselors (students who have completed high school that have a strong interest in cybersecurity), counselors (college students with cybersecurity experience), and university faculty & staff. This paper studies the impact of having counselors and junior counselors integrated into the cybersecurity summer camp experience and evaluates the impact that being a counselor has on the students that participate in that role. These impacts facilitate cybersecurity community engagement.

Social robot teaches cybersecurity.Social robots have recently been gaining attention in the education field. Given their capabilities, researchers can use social robots in various ways that support human-robot interactions. In this paper, we present an interactive cybersecurity education program to teach children about foundation cybersecurity concepts using a social robot. To create child-robot interactions in cybersecurity education, we devised three processes. First, in collaboration with practicing teachers we developed an interactive story to support student engagement and learning of cybersecurity concepts. Second, we prototyped animations for the story on the social robot. Third, we use a mixed-methods approach to pilot test our cybersecurity education program. Our research highlights the potential of social robot use in education, both for child-robot interaction and K-12 cybersecurity education. collaborative learning. cybersecurity education. interest development.

Governance Model of a Cybersecurity Network: Best Practices in the Academic Literature.Proliferating cyber threats, both in terms of diversity and intensity, require a timely development and implementation of effective solutions, which is within the powers of very few organisations, and actually of very few countries. The European Union sees collaboration and the establishment of competence networks as indispensable for securing its digital economy, infrastructures, society, and democracy, and preserving its competitive advantages. Four pilot projects were launched in 2019 within the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme aiming at establishing and operating a pilot for a Cybersecurity Competence Network to develop and implement common cybersecurity research and innovation roadmap, to develop and validate an appropriate governance model of the network. The research team of one of the pilots, ECHO, conducted a comprehensive study to identify governance needs, priorities, and models, analysing for that purpose norms, existing networks, and academic sources and interviewing key stakeholders. This paper presents the results of the review of the academic literature conducted to identify and prioritise requirements and support the design of a governance model of a network in the field of cybersecurity. First, it outlines different approaches to creating and governing a Collaborative Networked Organisation (CNO). Then, the authors analyse a variety of CNO governance models and identify possible arrangements for the establishment of collaboration. Further, they examine the collaborative and absorptive capacity of networked organisations and discuss the issues of organisational resilience and value systems alignment in CNOs, with a focus on trust relationships and trustworthiness as one of the crucial factors of success. The paper concludes by summarising the key features of CNO governance models and elaborating on how the identified best practices can be applied in the development of a governance model of a cybersecurity network.

Criminal Law Protection of Cybersecurity Considering AI-based Cybercrime.As the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is unfolding, cybersecurity faces the invasion of AI. AI-based cybercrime becomes a product of technological development, posing a threat to national security, public security, and the protection of citizens' personal property rights and privacy rights. In particular, the derivation of cybercrime that follows the development of science and technology leads to a qualitative change in the patterns of cybercrimes, expanding the scope and depth of the harm caused by cybercrime, producing a series of impacts on the conviction rules of traditional criminal law in China. The defects such as the features of the principal offender being weakened, the definition of the responsibility for accessory to the principal offender not clear, the narrow scope applicable to one-sided accomplice are present. To this end, in the era where AI and cybercrime have deep integration, given the derivative trend of AI-based cybercrime, it is urgent to adjust the focus of criminal strategy against cybercrime. The horizontal docking of domestic substantive law and legal interpretation is performed to achieve a gradient balance between judicial interpretation and legislative amendment and adjust the criminal boundary in cybercrime evaluation, thereby changing the current high threshold of conviction in the cybercrime governance and late launch of punishment power.
Pre-Bachelor's Curricular Guidance For Cybersecurity Programs.There is a growing need for a minimum skill set within Cybersecurity Education to ensure graduates are able to meet the job requirements. The ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) has led creation of a set of guidelines for pre-bachelor's degree cybersecurity programs, called Cyber2yr2020. The Cyber2yr2020 guidelines underwent two rounds of public review, including a draft presentation at ITiCSE'19[1]. This poster presents the final curriculum guidelines, provides perspectives on the use, and highlights cybersecurity programs already aligned with the guidelines. curriculum. cyber2yr2020. cybersecurity education. pre-bachelor's degree 
Host-oriented approach to cyber security for the SCADA systems.Recent cyberattacks targeting Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)/Industrial Control System(ICS) exploit weaknesses of host system software environment and take over the control of host processes in the host of the station network. We analyze the attack path of these attacks, which features how the attack hijacks the host in the network and compromises the operations of field device controllers. The paper proposes a host-based protection method, which can prevent malware penetration into the process memory by code injection attacks. The method consists of two protection schemes. One is to prevent file-based code injection such as DLL injection. The other is to prevent fileless code injection. The method traces changes in memory regions and determine whether the newly allocated memory is written with malicious codes. For this method, we show how a machine learning method can be adopted.

Cybersecurity Risk Assessment of the University of Northern Philippines using PRISM Approach.The University of Northern Philippines (UNP) rely on critical infrastructure systems to promote innovation and efficiency in fulfilling its core mandate - deliver quality education. Like any environment, UNP's cyber environment is vulnerable to security risks which dampen the privacy and safety of stakeholders, the security of assets, and the confidentiality of business proceedings. To proactively address these and other potential risks, this study reviewed existing risk management frameworks used across governments and selected one to be utilized for improving organizational cyber policies and risk mitigation procedures and practices - PRISM, a model to identify and implement cybersecurity risk management tailored towards the problems and needs of the university. Results showed that at least half of the risk areas have poor preparedness level, stemming from the lack of institutionalization of knowledge and solutions, assessing unusual behavior, and proactive and enterprise risk management. Most risk areas seemed to be prioritized, had allocated resources, and has reactive risk management in place. GAP Analysis was also conducted in conjunction with the results of PRISM assessment to better steer the university in the right direction. The study concluded that PRISM is a tool that aided the university in laying down a formalized groundwork for cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity Perspectives for Smart Building Automation Systems.As the built environment becomes the hallmark of urbanisation tendencies worldwide, people have come to rely on buildings for a large majority of their daily activities. Modern buildings are equipped with new sensor technologies and advanced controllers, integrated through communication interfaces and application software to handle various required functions through automation. This is partially extended to legacy buildings through retrofitting. Integration of these new technologies opens up the automation system of the building to internal and external attackers. The challenges related to cybersecurity identified are partially similar to the industrial control system domain while adding specific constraints for the built environment as compared to a production/manufacturing environment, which relate to human safety, security and privacy aspects. We provide a critical overview of cybersecurity challenges for smart building automation systems by focusing on key areas of development at the device, system and communication and interoperability levels. A representative example for BACnet protocol features and tools is provided. automation. BACnet. cybersecurity. intrusion detection systems. smart building 
Blockchain as a solution to Drone Cybersecurity.Industry 4.0 has revolutionized industrial processes. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increased due to the need to facilitate automation. Initially, drone usage was confined to military usage and other institutions that required high-level government clearance. Back then, the number of operating drones was few who made it easier to regulate and secure. However, with the emergence of Industry 4.0, the need for drone usage has increased in various industries. These industries include insurance, health, e-commerce, learning institutions, conducting and coordinating military airstrikes, and performing weather monitoring, among other crucial functionalities. The increased use and adoption of drones has resulted in the Internet of Drones. As more industries continue to adopt drone usage, the issue of securing them arises. The need for organizations to ensure and coordinate thousands of drones has necessitated the adoption of a security mechanism that guarantees the security of these devices. We explore the use of Blockchain technology as a means of enhancing drone cybersecurity. We research how industrial players perceive Blockchain and its contribution to cybersecurity. Blockchain.

Analysis of Cybersecurity Mechanisms with respect to Dependability and Security Attributes.Embedded electronic systems need to be equipped with different types of security mechanisms to protect themselves and to mitigate the effects of cybersecurity attacks. These mechanisms should be evaluated with respect to their impacts on dependability and security attributes such as availability, reliability, safety, etc. The evaluation is of great importance as, e.g., a security mechanism should never violate the system safety. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate a comprehensive set of security mechanisms consisting of 17 different types of mechanisms with respect to their impact on dependability and security attributes. The results show that, in general, the use of these mechanisms have positive effect on system dependability and security. However, there are at least three mechanisms that could have negative impacts on system dependability by violating safety and availability requirements. The results support our claim that the analyses such as the ones conducted in this paper are necessary when selecting and implementing an optimal set of safety and security mechanisms. cybersecurity mechanism. privacy. safety 
Epistemological Questions for Cybersecurity.The purpose of this theoretical paper is to facilitate multidisciplinary dialogue between cybersecurity researchers and those from other disciplines regarding the roots of knowledge. The approach taken is to articulate explicit questions about the origins of cybersecurity knowledge based on the author's reflections on common ground and differences between cybersecurity knowledge creation practices and selected epistemological sources. Although no independent evidence is presented for the validity or utility of these questions, the author hopes to refine these questions and the underlying assumptions on which they are based both through feedback on this paper and future empirical studies. cybersecurity. epistemology. future studies. learning. pedagogy. psychology. science and technology studies

Technical codes'potentialities in cybersecurity. A contextual approach on the ethics of small digital organizations in France.With the proliferation of malware and phishing attacks, information security has become a major challenge for companies. Organizations of all sizes have had to develop efficient cybersecurity strategies. Part of the literature has explained the growing cyber risks by the human factor such as the mistakes of users. Our aim is to analyze the user's cybersecurity ethics in their working context. We used the Feenberg's concepts of technical codes' potentialities to critically interpret the technical codes of users. We found three technical codes representing a variety of dimensions and combined a diversity of point of view about cybersecurity ethics: interest, values and priorities. These technical codes allow us to uncover alternative representations of user's ethics and to think critically on the way researchers, practitioners and information security specialists view and imagine the future of information security among small organizations. Our empirical findings are based on a critical qualitative research among small organizations with similar cybersecurity systems in France. contextual approach.

Adapting STPA-sec for Socio-technical Cyber Security Challenges in Emerging Nations: A Case Study in Risk Management for Rwandan Health Care. Healthcare is increasingly dependent on digital systems. In emerging nations, it can be particularly hard for hospital administrators to maximize the benefits of these advances and at the same time mitigate the potential cyber security risks associated with healthcare information systems. This paper argues that limited resources, rising demand and rapidly evolving organizational structures create a pressing need for holistic approaches to address socio-technical security challenges in healthcare. We do not underestimate the technological challenges of cyber security in these countries. equally technical solutions are unlikely to be effective unless supported by holistic risk assessment. We address these problems by the use of STAMP (Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) for cyber security analysis, STPA-sec. Our results show that this open-ended analytical technique requires additional methodological structure in countries where there are significant shortages of trained analysts. to guide the application of STPA-sec and also to provide common reference when individual analysts must justify their findings. It is for this reason that we explicitly integrate the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) controls into STPA-sec. This provided our stakeholders with a starting point for the application of socio-technical analysis and enhanced the mainstream cyber security and risk management to provide a better fit within healthcare from emerging nations. further studies are required to determine whether such support becomes superfluous as analysts become familiar with socio-technical methods. Our arguments have been validated through extensive observation, interviews and document reviews with healthcare providers in Rwanda. In particular, we focus on an initiative to improve the cyber security of a hospital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). It is our hope that the lessons learned in one country might inform cyber security risk management for healthcare across other emerging nations who face limited resources, significant public demand and an increasing range of threats.

Model for Cyber Security Information Sharing in Healthcare Sector. In the modern society almost all services are based on data-networks and networked systems. Especially through the growing digitalization an increasing number of services is connected to data-networks. One example of a highly digitalized domain is the healthcare sector, where a cyber-attack could cause extreme circumstances. Decision making requires knowledge about the current situation. Particularly, in the complex domain of cyber security where the boundaries of physical world do not exist, situational awareness has a determinative role. One source for required cyber security information is obtained by sharing information: different organizations share the information between each other. Typically, Cyber security information has classification levels, which affects challenges for information sharing between different organizations. In this study, the model for information sharing between different organizations with different classification levels is developed and tested in the simulation. Because of its importance, the developed model is tested in the simulation of a healthcare domain. however, it can be utilized in all business sectors. In this paper, not only the developed model with simulation results is presented, but also tested in real life scenarios within an existing project. Cyber Security. Security Information Sharing.

A Cybersecurity Model for Decision-Making Problems under Uncertainty Using Game Theory.We propose a new cybersecurity decision-making model based on game-theory and decision-making process. The proposed model allows the cyber defender to make optimal decisions by considering perceived damage, cost of potential defensive actions, and benefit to mission. We provide detailed examples and numerical results supporting our model to show how game theory can help the decision-making process for cybersecurity by focusing on situations of conflict between an attacker and a defender. cybersecurity. decision-making. game theory 
Development of IoT security exercise contents for cyber security exercise system.In this paper, we discuss the development of the IoT security exercise content and the implementation of it to the CyExec. While the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more popular, vulnerability countermeasures are insufficient, and many incidents have occurred. It is because there is insufficient protection against vulnerabilities specific to IoT equipment. Also, the developers and users have low awareness of IoT devices against vulnerabilities from the past. Therefore, the importance of security education on IoT devices is increasing. However, the enormous burden of introduction and operation costs limited the use of commercial cybersecurity exercise systems. CyExec (Cyber Security Exercise System), consisting of a virtual environment using VirtualBox and Docker, is a low-cost and flexible cybersecurity exercise system, which we have proposed for the dissemination of security education. And the content of the exercises for CyExec is composed of the Basic exercises and Applied exercises. Cybersecurity. CyExec. IoT. Security education 
Cyber Security Decision Making Informed by Cyber Threat Intelligence (CYDETI) : IEEE CNS 20 Poster.As organisations around the world are embracing digitalisation to facilitate their business operations, their digital footprint is drawing the attention of adversaries and cyber activists. This is forcing the boards of organisations to engage actively in the cyber security decision making of the organisation. However, | the boards themselves face the challenges of understanding the organisational threat landscape whilst also considering business continuity in terms of cyber security investment and decision trade-offs. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a cyber security decision-making informed by cyber threat intelligence (CYDETI) framework. The CYDETI framework utilises cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and risk management taxonomies to inform decision making. The novel aspect of the framework is that it feeds CTI from the technical level to the operational level and ultimately to the strategic level. Furthermore, | a planned scenario implementation and future studies are envisioned with leading industrial organisations. boards. cyber threat intelligence. decision making. risk assessment 
Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Security Based on Convolution Neural Network: A survey. The expanding growth of computer and communication technologies results in a vast amount of security concerns. Various types of cyber-security enabled mechanisms have been developed to limit these concerns. Anomaly detection is among these mechanisms. Anomaly detection means using multiple techniques and methods to detect different patterns that do not conform to defined features of whole data. Recently, deep learning techniques adopted as a satisfactory solution because of its ability to extract data features from data itself. Convolution neural network (CNN) is mainly utilized because of its ability to process input with multi-dimensions. In this paper, a comprehensive survey about using CNN as a key solution for anomaly detection is provided. Most of the existing solutions in the literature have been gathered and classified according to the input data source. furthermore, this paper suggests a unified cross framework that simulates end-to-end anomaly detection mechanisms that exist in the previous studies. A unified cross framework enriches this paper with in-depth analysis to clarify how the solution in the literature uses CNN in anomaly detection. Finally, this paper suggests several future research directions that can support the audience in their future works in this context. Anomaly Detection. CNN. Deep Learning. Security 
A Survey of Blockchain-based Cybersecurity for Vehicular Networks.The development of vehicular networks has greatly improved the efficiency and safety of intelligent traffic systems. However, it also introduces additional security threats into the system. The special characteristics of vehicular networks, such as dynamic topology, huge network scale and so on, make it difficult to adopt the traditional security solutions directly into this scenario. In addition, the single point failure problem of the centralized security mechanisms is also a big challenge. Recently, blockchain technology, which is a distributed database, is a potential approach to address these security issues. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the existing blockchain-based cybersecurity mechanisms is presented with the corresponding performance analysis. The purpose of this work is to provide a guideline for the further study in the application of blockchain in the vehicular network security area. Authentication. Blockchain. Cybersecurity.

A Co-simulation Platform for Evaluating Cyber Security and Control Applications in the Smart Grid.The growing adoption of Distributed Energy Re-sources (DER) in low-voltage distribution grids calls for new feedback control algorithms that rely on quasi-real-time data collected by remote sensors. The design and evaluation of such algorithms necessitates a prudent and comprehensive approach since these algorithms require a tight integration of power and communication systems. A simple link failure or a sophisticated cyberattack launched against the grid's monitoring, communication, and control infrastructure could rapidly grow out of control, making the grid unstable. We investigate the design and implementation of a high-fidelity smart grid simulation platform which integrates a network simulator and a power flow simulator using the Mosaik co-simulation framework. The platform allows for evaluating the performance of new control algorithms and understanding dynamics of modern distribution grids. Example case studies are presented to validate the proposed platform. Co-Simulation. Cybersecurity. Networks. Power Distribution Systems. Power Flow 
Cyber Security of Smart Grid: Attacks and Defenses.Most of today's infrastructure systems can be efficiently operated thanks to the intelligent power supply of the smart grids. However, smart grids are highly vulnerable to malicious attacks, that is, because of the interplay between the components in the smart grids, the failure of some critical components may result in the cascading failure and breakdown of the whole system. Therefore, the question of how to identify the most critical components to protect the smart grid system is the first challenge to operators. To enable the system's robustness, there has been a lot of effort aimed at the system analysis, designing new architectures, and proposing new algorithms. However, these works mainly introduce different ranking methods for link (transmission line) or node (station) identification and directly select most the highest degree nodes or common links as the critical ones. These methods fail to address the problem of interdependencies between components nor consider the role of users that is one of critical factors impacting on the smart grid vulnerability assessment. This motivates us to study a more general and practical problem in terms of smart grid vulnerability assessment, namely the Maximum-Impact through Critical-Line with Limited Budget (MICLLB) problem. The objective of this research is to provide an efficient method to identify critical components in the system by considering a realistic attack scenario. attack. cascading failure. defense..

Implementing the NIS Directive, driving cybersecurity improvements for Essential Services.A review by the National Audit Office of the National Cyber Security Programme recommended a more robust performance framework, to understand the impact of the Programme and to focus activities going forward. The Directive on security of network and information systems (the NIS Directive) has placed responsibility for essential aspects of supply chains on Operators of Essential Services (OES). Our dependence on international supply chains also requires a performance framework to assist cybersecurity improvements in this area. The following sections describe work to investigate the implementation of the NIS Directive by Competent Authorities (CA) and OES and proposes a framework to monitor performance across interdependencies. This is to enable development of a more effective set of performance metrics to guide interventions and improvements in cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. critical infrastructure. cybersecurity. metrics. resilience. supply chains 
The Visual Design of Network Data to Enhance Cyber Security Awareness of the Everyday Internet User.Technology and the use of online services are very prevalent across much of our everyday lives. As our digital interactions continue to grow, there is a need to improve public awareness of the risks to our personal online privacy and security. Designing for cyber security awareness has never been so important. In this work, we consider people's current impressions towards their privacy and security online. We also explore how abnormal network activity data can be visually conveyed to afford a heightened cyber security awareness. In detail, the paper documents the different effects of visual variables in an edge and node DoS visualisation to depict abnormally high volumes of traffic. The results from two studies show that people are generally becoming more concerned about their privacy and security online. Moreover, we have found that the more focus based visual techniques (i.e. blur) and geometry-based techniques (i.e. jaggedness and sketchiness) afford stronger impressions of uncertainty from abnormally high volumes of network traffic. In terms of security, these impressions and feelings alert in the end-user that something is not quite as it should be and hence develop a heightened cyber security awareness.
Cybersecurity Risk Management in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Systematic Review of Recent Evidence.Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been encouraged to take advantage of any possible business opportunities by utilizing and adopting new-technologies such as cloud computing services, there is a huge misunderstanding of their cyber threats from the management perspective. Underestimation of cybersecurity threats by SMEs leads to an increase in their vulnerabilities and risks, which unfortunately can become actual challenges to them and other related parties. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review based on recently available evidence on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs in order to understand the current situation. The authors aim to reveal the role the SMEs' management is playing in addressing cybersecurityrisks in recent years, as found in the literature, and to suggest avenues for further research. The paper follows a well-known method for conducting a systematic literature review. Starting with a keyword search and an assessment of fitness for this review, 15 papers out of 50 have been analysed by NVivo software according to bibliographical information, research design and findings. The review identified 5 major perspectives that play a key role in SMEs' cybersecurity risk management, which are threats, behaviours, practices, awareness, and decision-making respectively. Importantly, empirical research on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs is needed. Cybersecurity. Risk management. SMEs 
A survey of cyber security in the Swedish manufacturing industry.In this paper we explore cyber security practices in Swedish manufacturing firms. Manufacturing is being transformed by new technologies under the label of smart industry or industry 4.0. Most of these technologies are either digital themselves or depend on digital connectivity. Their use is made possible by electronic sensors, actuators, and other devices as well as by data-driven analysis. This technological change entails a fundamental shift in risk and security as devices become interconnected, making information and control transmissible both within and to varying degree outside the firm's organization. These issues must be addressed to prevent both unintentional and intentional security incidents. Thus, there will be no smart industry without cyber security. Based on a sector-wide survey with 649 respondents (17% response rate) carried out in collaboration with the Association of Swedish Engineering Industries, we map risk perception and the controls put in place to address these risks across firms. We present three primary findings: (i) Compared to how firms value further investments in digitalization, risk perception related to cyber security issues is fairly low and business interruption is a greater cause for worry than data breach, (ii) there is a gap between the anticipated impact of digitalization and the perceived need for cyber security measures across business functions within firms, and (iii) the implementation of cyber security measures is still in its infancy with a significant bias towards technological measures, leaving organizational and social cyber security measures underrepresented. The paper is concluded with the identification of a few interesting follow-up questions for future work. Cyber Insurance. Cyber Risk Assessment. Cyber Risk Propagation. Manufacturing.

Examining the Cyber Security of a Real World Access Control Implementation.As smart cards have become increasingly prevalent in electronic access control systems, this paper investigates an implementation at a national institution, which uses a smart card with publicly known weaknesses. The main outcome is a set of recommendations which can be used for securing electronic access control systems against the discovered flaws of this work: The implementation did not follow guidelines from the manufacturer of the cards, the content of the restricted sector was printed onto each card, and in-house services with inherent security flaws were built around the cards, but not maintained. These flaws meant that the civil registration number of any employee at the institution could be revealed. Additionally, the flaws allowed for changing the PIN code of any card in the system.

Beyond the Prisoner's Dilemma: The Social Dilemmas of Cybersecurity.The Prisoner's Dilemma represents an ubiquitous approach to security modeling that emphasizes adversarial relationships between actors. Adopting this approach helps understand ambiguous relationships in information domains. Despite the fact that some actors might adopt these frames, the Prisoner's Dilemma reflects only one of many possible social dilemmas. In this paper, we outline a computational approach to cybersecurity based on Interdependence Theory. Interdependence Theory provides a means to decompose payoff matrices into social influence components based on the amount of control actors and partners have in a situation. It additionally accounts for joint control that develops from the mutual decisions of both players. By focusing on two-person, two-option games, this approach can model many different social situations that reflect nor-mal and anomalous network activity. cybersecurity. game theory.

National Cybersecurity Strategy for Developing Countries : Case study: Ecuador proposal [Estrategia Nacional de Ciberseguridad para Paises en Desarrollo Caso de estudio: Propuesta Ecuador].The use of Information and Communication Technologies maintains inherent risks that affect the processes they support, many with state responsibility and that must be systematically managed through a National Cybersecurity Strategy (ENC). However, in some developing countries this has not yet happened, due to circumstances in the region and due to political, economic or social considerations that in some way have impeded their development or have developed in an incipient manner with the collaboration of concerned international organizations. Models and examples of National Strategies have been published, but in some cases oriented to developed countries or cultures different from that of the region. Good practice manuals have also been prepared by international organizations that work on these issues, based on lessons learned in similar exercises carried out in some cases with foreign consultants far from the local reality. This work presents a proposal based on good practices and knowledge of the local reality previously defined through research carried out on the components of a National Strategy. The proposal aims to guide those interested in the product to obtain after a participatory methodological process of executing a life cycle explained in previous works published by these authors.

Proficiency Testing for Software Analysis and Cybersecurity Laboratories.Proficiency tests are a central activity in demonstrating the competence of accredited laboratories. In the present work, we developed a proposal for the realization of Proficiency Testing for laboratories that work in the areas of software testing and cybersecurity. This is the first example of a Proficiency Testing round focusing on software code analysis activities, an important activity in software compliance assessment programs. The proposed approach uses code coverage metrics to evaluate the ability of laboratories in evaluating the source code of a software. We prove the feasibility of the proposal through the execution of a proficiency test 'round' with the participation of six laboratories accredited to conduct software tests in compliance assessment programs in Brazil.
Cyber-Security Gaps in a Digital Substation: From Sensors to SCADA.Development of digital substations provides power industrial operation, real-time functionalities and information access. A main challenge in DS is to ensure security, availability, and reliability of power systems as in conventional systems in addition to interoperability capability for different vendors. DS development is rather new in Norway and in an RD Digital Substation pilot project ECODIS 11Engineering and Condition monitoring in Digital Substation (ECODIS) is a project funded by Research Council of Norway (NFR), Innovation Project for the Industrial Sector - ENERGIX program, project number 296550, coordinated by Statnett RD group., Statnett 22Statnett is the system operator of the Norwegian power system. is investigating new functionality advantages and associated costs with IEC 61850 process bus technology. This paper examines cyber-security gaps and vulnerabilities introduced through digitalization of substations.
On the Cyber Security of Lebanon: A Large Scale Empirical Study of Critical Vulnerabilities.In this paper, we uncover 1645 critical vulnerabilities in the perimeter of Lebanon affecting the majority of its sectors, including critical infrastructure. Given the enormous economic and personal damage imposed by critical vulnerabilities, we use a novel framework to regularly identify these vulnerabilities in time on a large scale. We show that the root cause of the uncovered vulnerabilities is the lack of a core security best practice, namely, patch management. All the 1645 vulnerable systems had a patch offered by the vendor at the time they were found vulnerable. In addition to that, the poor reaction to our notification efforts to the owners of vulnerable systems underlines another lack of a proper incident handling process. To this end, this research shall be considered as a first step towards continuous attack surface evaluation of Lebanon, which shall involve different parties from public and private sectors in order to better perform risk analysis and mitigation.
A Study on Cybersecurity Challenges in E-learning and Database Management System.Education is gradually moving from traditional classroom-based setting to online-based. E-learning has become the topic of discussion as far as cybersecurity is concerned. E-learning as a mode of acquiring knowledge and skills through electronic means, cannot be achieved without internet technology. In other words, it depends largely on the internet technology for the sharing of ideas and information. However, the network environment is a home for hackers and the internet fraudless. As the reach of the internet expands to cover ever broader aspects of our education and social welfare, cybersecurity is the major concern when dealing with privacy, authentication, and confidentiality of user's information stored in a database server. Most often hackers release attacks designed to steal confidential data and an organization's database servers are the targets of these attacks because they are the core of any organization, storage bank. Hence, it is very important to put strong security measures in place to protect the data and information of the end-user against any malicious attack. This paper, therefore, aimed to discuss cybersecurity issues related to the e-learning management system, the significance of the e-Learning, and the Database Management System. Again the paper discusses top security issues in databases and how to lessen them. cybersecurity. database management system. e-learning. hackers. malicious. skills. traditional 
Cybersecurity Evaluation with PowerShell.An organization's cybersecurity posture is trending as one of the most highly regarded areas of focus. As more companies fall victim to breaches and exploits, we find more cases where corporations are falling victim to this and we find they attribute to improper defined security practices, failure to have a policy to address breaches or even comply with their existing strategies. It comes as no surprise that the effects of breaches and the eventual compromise of data continues to impact every level from large corporations down to the individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to provide individuals with a comparative method to retrieve a common baseline of their cybersecurity posture versus an acceptable established standard. Existing audit measures are quite cumbersome and introduce room for errors. Using PowerShell provides a method to automate parsing information into a company's existing policy and expose any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. PowerShell audit process used here will provide an organization with the method to self-check without having to incorporate the use of software from third-party tools. Because of PowerShell's flexibility of parsing information using from the OS environment. CSET as designed by the collaborative efforts from Department Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) provides a very thorough method of producing an evaluation of the organization's Cybersecurity posture. Their tool achieves this through various means which may require an auditor participant to produce the necessary information by manually extracting values, such as whether software firewall rules are enabled or not. The research done here will focus on executing query commands and automating much of the manual process of gathering data to eliminate the human component. We achieve this by combining PowerShell functions which can give the auditor another method to tailor their audit experience to what is relevant in their area of concern.

Cybersecurity Games for Secure Programming Education in the Industry: Gameplay Analysis. To minimize the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities in source code, software developers may attend security awareness and secure coding training. From the various approaches of how to raise awareness and adherence to coding standards, one promising novel approach is Cybersecurity Challenges. However, in an industrial setting, time is a precious resource, and, therefore, one needs to understand how to optimize the gaming experience of Cybersecurity Challenges and the effect of this game on secure coding skills. This work identifies the time spent solving challenges of different categories, analyzes gaming strategies in terms of a slow and fast team profile, and relates these profiles to the game success. First results indicate that the slow strategy is more successful than the fast approach. The authors also analyze the possible implications in the design and the training of secure coding in an industrial setting by means of Cybersecurity Challenges. This work concludes with a brief overview of its limitations and next steps in the study. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Security and privacy ! Software security engineering. Security and privacy !

Analysis of academic service cybersecurity in university based on framework COBIT 5 using CMMI.A secure academic information system is part of the college. The security of academic information systems is very important to maintain information optimally and safely. Along with the development of technology, academic information systems are often misused by some irresponsible parties that can cause threats. To prevent these things from happening, it is necessary to know the extent to which the security of the academic information system of universities is conducted by evaluating. So the research was conducted to determine the Maturity Level on the governance of the security of University Ahmad Dahlan academic information system by using the COBIT 5 framework on the DSS05 domain. The DSS05 domain on COBIT 5 is a good framework to be used in implementing and evaluating related to the security of academic information systems. Whereas to find out the achievement of evaluation of academic information system security level, CMMI method is needed. The combination of the COBIT 5 framework on the DSS05 domain using the CMMI method in academic information system security is able to provide a level of achievement in the form of a Maturity Level value. The results of the COBIT 5 framework analysis of the DSS05 domain use the CMMI method to get a Maturity level of 4,458 so that it determines the achievement of the evaluation of academic information systems at the tertiary level is Managed and Measurable. This level, universities are increasingly open to technological developments. Universities have applied the quantification concept in each process, and are always monitored and controlled for performance in the security of academic information systems.
Analysis and forecasting strategies of attacks on game resources for distributed cybersecurity training games.Game tasks are vulnerable to methods of obtaining benefits based on the results of attacks on game resources. In such conditions, it is critical to determine, monitor and evaluate the possibility of such attacks. It is also advisable to select methods to prevent them in advance, constructing the gaming environment accordingly. The paper describes various types of attacks on the gaming environment, its vulnerable components. Some possibilities for building gaming environment were shown. To improve the architecture of the gaming environment, identify possible channels of key information leakage, game theory methods were chosen. The analysis was performed and the possibility of predicting the attack on game resources for a certain type of gaming environment was shown. For a distributed multiplayer security awareness game based on a real case, the estimates for the selected types of attacks are shown, the attacker's selection criteria for the attack are calculated, and countermeasures are proposed. The article presents the results of two computational experiments with minor differences in the network infrastructure and the stored amount of game key information. The results of the modelling of the main types of threats completely coincided with the obtained empirical data. The results shown can be used to evaluate various types of information security strategies in case of limited resources. The application of the approach is possible in various gamified media, including additional restrictions.
Analysis of appropriate standards to solve cybersecurity problems in public organizations.The development of ICTs in the globalized world has forced countries to develop problems or implement affected problems because new vulnerabilities have always been presented every day, so not having implemented a standard security standard brings problems such as data theft, leaks, malicious software among others. The objective of this investigative work is to analyze the cybersecurity analyzes that are used in public organizations in the Republic of Ecuador, for this purpose, a search was made of the different national and international security controls in order to compare them and by their similarities determine the security guidelines that are used in public organizations and any that apply. The deductive and exploratory method was used for the development of this research, it resulted in the analysis of EGSI data and after analyzing the percentage of initial and final compliance, it was concluded that the cybersecurity sensors in public organizations were low and are currently can be considered as means, since even the assessment does not incorporate all the international security parameters.

A non-cooperative game based model for the cybersecurity of autonomous systems.Autonomous systems (AS) would soon revolutionize the way we live and work. The days are not so far when these systems, from delivery drones to driverless cars, would be seen around us. These systems are connected and rely heavily on the communication network for the information exchange, hence prone to several attacks. Human lives will be at risk if these systems are compromised. Cybersecurity modeling and attack analysis of AS needs the utmost attention of the research community. Primarily, a typical AS has three modules - perception, cognition, and control - and each one of them comes with their own vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose a new AS architecture that may prove useful in AS cybersecurity modeling. We also model the attacks on them, and defense mechanisms applied to these modules using a non-cooperative non-zero sum game. Finally, we solve this game to obtain optimal strategies to maintain a secure system state. Autonomous systems. Cybersecurity. Game theory. Nash Equilibrium 
Automated decision systems for cybersecurity and infrastructure security.This paper describes and discusses the impact of using automated decision systems (ADS), or decision automation, on the spectrum from decision support systems (DSS), where a human makes decisions based on analytics generated by the system, to intelligent decision systems based on analytics performed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), and further, to fully autonomous intelligent decision systems, where a machine independently makes decisions based on its AI and ML capabilities. Specifically, we examine the use of decision automation in cybersecurity and infrastructure security and present a methodology for determining which decisions should be automated and at which level of autonomy.

Assessment of cyber security implications of new technology integrations into military supply chains.Military supply chains play a critical role in the acquisition and movement of goods for defence purposes. The disruption of these supply chain processes can have potentially devastating affects to the operational capability of military forces. The introduction and integration of new technologies into defence supply chains can serve to increase their effectiveness. However, the benefits posed by these technologies may be outweighed by significant consequences to the cyber security of the entire defence supply chain. Supply chains are complex Systems of Systems, and the introduction of an insecure technology into such a complex ecosystem may induce cascading system-wide failure, and have catastrophic consequences to military mission assurance. Subsequently, there is a need for an evaluative process to determine the extent to which a new technology will affect the cyber security of military supply chains. This work proposes a new model, the Military Supply Chain Cyber Implications Model (M-SCCIM), that serves to aid military decision makers in understanding the potential cyber security impact of introducing new technologies to supply chains. M-SCCIM is a multiphase model that enables understanding of cyber security and supply chain implications through the lenses of theoretical examinations, pilot applications and system wide implementations.

Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenges of Electrical Power Systems of the Future.Electrical Power Systems (EPSs) are among the most prominent critical infrastructures of our digital society. Assets, systems and networks of most other critical infrastructure sectors depend heavily on EPSs and would fail in the event of persistent electricity supply problems. This should make EPSs attractive targets for cyberattacks, so it is somewhat surprising that few large-scale successful cyberattacks on the electricity sector have been reported so far.EPSs structures are undergoing deep changes that will accelerate over the next years. A convergence of environmental concerns and technological evolution is leading to the widespread use of distributed renewable microgeneration, electric vehicles, distributed energy storage, Internet of Things, smart grids and software-defined operating devices. These game-changing innovations are reshaping EPSs. The previously well-ordered computational environment where a limited number of agents interacted in predictable ways will gradually receive new layers of agents, where thousands or even millions of them will buy or sell services in a kind of giant open market. The search for individual advantages or profits rather than overall system welfare will guide the actions of these new participants.This work examines the traditional structure of EPSs from a cybersecurity point of view as well as foreseeable changes. It will also look at associated risks and discuss possible approaches to mitigate them. critical infrastructure. electrical power systems. industrial control systems. SCADA. soft cybersecurity 
The role of artificial intelligence and cyber security for social media.Social media systems such as Facebook and Twitter are playing a major role in society connecting over a billion people worldwide and enabling them to communicate and share information with each other as well as within a group of individuals. These social media systems can vastly help humanity such as spread information about infectious diseases and discuss solutions to problems faced by humanity including preventing child trafficking and violence against women. However, social media systems can also do harm, such as shared false information, more popularly known as fake news, as well as violating the privacy of individuals. With the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems together with powerful machine learning techniques as well as the cyber-attacks on information systems are changing the way the social media systems are being used by humans. This paper discusses the role of both AI and Cyber Security for social media systems including the benefits of AI as well as protecting social media systems. AI. Artificial intelligence.

From Hodl to Heist: Analysis of Cyber Security Threats to Bitcoin Exchanges.Bitcoin is gaining traction as an alternative store of value. Its market capitalization transcends all other cryptocurrencies in the market. But its high monetary value also makes it an attractive target to cyber criminal actors. Hacking campaigns usually target the weakest points in an ecosystem. In Bitcoin, these are currently the exchange platforms. As each exchange breach potentially decreases Bitcoin's market value by billions, it is a threat not only to direct victims, but to everyone owning Bitcoin. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We also show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is not on par with other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. With exchanges being targeted by nation-state hacking groups, security needs to be a first concern. attacks. bitcoin. cryptocurrency exchanges. cyber security. cyber threat intelligence

Temporal Understanding of Cybersecurity Threats.As cybersecurity-related threats continue to increase, understanding how the field is changing over time can give insight into combating new threats and understanding historical events. We show how to apply dynamic topic models to a set of cybersecurity documents to understand how the concepts found in them are changing over time. We correlate two different data sets, the first relates to specific exploits and the second relates to cybersecurity research. We use Wikipedia concepts to provide a basis for performing concept phrase extraction and show how using concepts to provide context improves the quality of the topic model. We represent the results of the dynamic topic model as a knowledge graph that could be used for inference or information discovery. Cybersecurity. Dynamic Topic Modeling. Knowledge Graph.

'Lime', 'Open Lock', and 'Blocked': Children's Perception of Colors, Symbols, and Words in Cybersecurity Warnings.Cybersecurity warnings are frequently ignored or misinterpreted by even experienced adults. While studies have been conducted to examine warning design for adults, there is little data to establish recommendations for children. We conducted user studies with 22 children (ages 10-12) and with 22 adults. We compare their risk perception of warning design parameters (signal colors, symbols, words) via card sorting and ranking activities followed by interviews. While our findings suggest similarities in how both groups interpret the design parameters (e.g., red, skull, and fatal convey danger), we also uncovered potential concerns with items currently used as security indicators (e.g., both groups had mixed interpretations of the open lock and police officer symbols). Individual risk perception, particularly for children, appears dependent on personal preferences and experience. Our findings suggest implications and future research directions for the design of cybersecurity warnings for children. children. cybersecurity warnings. risk perception 
We Hold Each Other Accountable : Unpacking How Social Groups Approach Cybersecurity and Privacy Together .Digital resources are often collectively owned and shared by small social groups (e.g., friends sharing Netflix accounts, roommates sharing game consoles, families sharing WhatsApp groups). Yet, little is known about (i) how these groups jointly navigate cybersecurity and privacy (S&P) decisions for shared resources, (ii) how shared experiences influence individual S&P attitudes and behaviors, and (iii) how well existing S&P controls map onto group needs. We conducted group interviews and a supplemental diary study with nine social groups (n=34) of varying relationship types. We identified why, how and what resources groups shared, their jointly construed threat models, and how these factors influenced group strategies for securing shared resources. We also identified missed opportunities for cooperation and stewardship among group members that could have led to improved S&P behaviors, and found that existing S&P controls often fail to meet the needs of these small social groups. groups. interviews. privacy. qualitative methods. security. social cybersecurity 
Understanding Cybersecurity Practices in Emergency Departments.Emergency departments (EDs) have unique operational requirements within hospitals. They have strong availability demands, are staffed by rotating personnel, and must provide services as quickly as possible. Modern EDs are also heavily computerized, and as such cybersecurity practices play a key role in meeting the expected operational standards. To better understand the cybersecurity challenges in EDs, we conducted a survey asking 347 ED personnel across Canada about their cybersecurity practices. The survey collected information relating to authentication and password management, use of personal devices for handling patient data, Internet connectivity on personal and hospital systems, and institutional security policies. Our results show that across multiple hospitals, deployed computer security systems fail to integrate with the requirements of staff and patients, leading to interruptions and inefficiencies. hospitals. medicine. security. usability

Enriching Systems Theory Based Cyber-Security and Safety Analysis Using Stakeholder Value Networks.System-theoretic process analysis for security (STPA-Sec) is a powerful safety and security analysis method that focuses on unsafe and unsecure interactions between subsystems rather than component failure and its resulting chain-of-event failure modes. The first step of STPA-Sec requires the analyst to identify the system boundary and list the system losses and hazards. Current approach to performing this first and critical step of STPA-Sec requires interviewing the stakeholders and could potentially result in a narrow focus due to stakeholder's mental model and resulting answers to questions. In some cases, stakeholders are not available for interviews and we risk influencing the system loss identification by the mental model of the analyst. We believe these two potential issues in the STPA-Sec analysis: Narrow focus and missing access to stakeholder, can be address by factoring additional system information through stakeholder analysis. To illustrate the benefit of this approach a mining system is considered. Stakeholders in the mining system are identified and then classified based on the role that they play in the expected emergent behavior of the system. Stakeholder needs are identified and ranked. A stakeholder value network (map) is created with stakeholder as nodes and value exchanges between them representing the connections. A ranked list of value exchanges is created based on the impact of cybersecurity on the stakeholder map. System level-losses are identified from high impact value exchanges, which can then be fed into the step 1 of STPA-Sec analysis. A system level goal statement, derived from the stakeholder analysis, is used as a guiding statement and an aid in drawing a boundary around the system.
An Integrated View on Automotive SPICE, Functional Safety and Cyber-Security. The automotive domain has seen safety engineering at the forefront of the industry's priorities for the last decade. Therefore, additional safety engineering efforts, design approaches, and well-established safety processes have been stipulated. Today many connected and automated vehicles are available and connectivity features and information sharing are increasingly used. This increases the attractiveness of an attack on vehicles and thus introduces new risks for vehicle cybersecurity. Thus, just as safety became a critical part of the development in the late 20th century, the automotive domain must now consider cybersecurity as an integral part of the development of modern vehicles. Aware of this fact, the automotive industry has, therefore, recently taken multiple efforts in designing and producing safe and secure connected and automated vehicles. As the domain geared up for the cybersecurity challenges, they leveraged experiences from many other domains, but must face several unique challenges. For that aim, the domain invested multiple efforts in the development of industry standards to tackle automotive cybersecurity issues and protect their assets. The joint working group of the standardization organizations ISO and SAE has recently established and published a committee draft of the ISO/SAE CD 21434 Road Vehicles-Cybersecurity Engineering  standard. This paper will summarize the previous results and extensions of the SoQrates assessment model, the working group's vision and work from prior publications, how Automotive SPICE can also support the auditing of projects with close security relations, also in the context of the new ISO/SAE CD 21434. This work will show enhanced and adapted approach details for the new ISO/SAE CD 21434 norm requirements. Further, we propose a structured method for integrating security and safety engineering in the existing Automotive SPICE context. Additionally, provide methodical descriptions for the security development based on an in-depth treatment on signal and data-level to determine the essential security architecture requirements on the system level.
Challenges in Integrating Cybersecurity into Existing Development Processes.For an established development process and a team accustomed to this process, adding cybersecurity features to the product initially means inconvenience and reduced productivity without perceivable benefits. Adapting development processes to take cybersecurity into account introduces challenges not present in engineering divisions so far. Strategies designed to deal with these challenges differ in the way in which added duties are assigned and cybersecurity topics are integrated into the already existing process steps. Cybersecurity requirements often clash with existing system requirements or established development methods, leading to low acceptance among developers, and introducing the need to have clear policies on how friction between cybersecurity and other fields is handled. A cybersecurity development approach is frequently perceived as introducing impediments, that bear the risk of cybersecurity measures receiving a lower priority to reduce inconvenience. Moreover, this leads to frustration among cybersecurity developers when their proposals are not accepted, and they feel their work is not appreciated. On the other hand, putting too much emphasis on cybersecurity leads to feature creep and makes the development unnecessarily complicated without producing appropriate results. It seems natural to orientate oneself by how safety topics are handled in the development process and adjust this to accommodate cybersecurity. It is, however, not clear in which way these added responsibilities should be assigned, as conflicts of interest occur when a single person must additionally take cybersecurity goals into account, which might be clashing with other project goals this person is responsible for. Ideally, cybersecurity aspects are considered and integrated into development processes not only to fulfill customer and legal requirements, but also to enable developers of functionalities not directly related to cybersecurity to produce better and more robust results as shortcuts are no longer easily possible.
Analysis of player behavior and EEG readings in a cybersecurity game.This paper describes a study of player behavior and electroencephalography (EEG) headset readings while playing a cybersecurity educational video game. While difficulty was progressively increased, player actions and EEG readings were recorded, along with a pre- and post-test of student knowledge and opinions regarding information security awareness and perceived immersion. This study employed Brute Force, a tower defense game that teaches players to choose strong, unique, and memorable passwords. Participants reported significantly more responsible attitudes regarding the importance of strong, unique passwords. More successful players who played the full fifteen minutes tended to improve at identifying strong passwords from a list. After playing the game, participants were most likely to add password length and uniqueness as important password strategies. Cybersecurity. Dynamic difficulty adjustment. Electroencephalography.

Cry wolf: Toward an experimentation platform and dataset for human factors in cyber security analysis.Computer network defense is a partnership between automated systems and human cyber security analysts. The system behaviors, for example raising a high proportion of false alarms, likely impact cyber analyst performance. Experimentation in the analyst-system domain is challenging due to lack of access to security experts, the usability of attack datasets, and the training required to use security analysis tools. This paper describes Cry Wolf, an open source web application for user studies of cyber security analysis tasks. This paper also provides an open-access dataset of 73 true and false Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarms derived from real-world examples of impossible travel scenarios. Cry Wolf and the impossible travel dataset were used in an experiment on the impact of IDS false alarm rate on analysts' abilities to correctly classify IDS alerts as true or false alarms. Results from that experiment are used to evaluate the quality of the dataset using difficulty and discrimination index measures drawn from classical test theory. Many alerts in the dataset provide good discrimination for participants' overall task performance. Cyber security. Human factors. IDS 
Do you see the warning?: Cybersecurity warnings via nonconscious processing.Computer warnings are often ignored or dismissed because they interrupt people's current workflow. We test a different perception channel, via nonconscious processing, to display warning and thus do not interrupt users' workflow. Specifically, we used subliminal messages displayed for 50 milliseconds. Our previous studies show that they significantly reduce people's disclosure of personal information. Compared to typical cognitive science studies, this display duration is long. An essential question is whether our warning messages are really delivered via nonconscious processing because different design elements may affect users' perception. In this project, we tested users' reactions to three warning message. We evaluated three important components: background and foreground colors, warning words, and text format inside the message box. Results show that 50 milliseconds are at the threshold of nonconscious processing, but the visibilities are different for different designs. Non-conscious Processing. Privacy. Subliminal Messaging.

Cybersecurity education and skills: Exploring students' perceptions, preferences and performance in a blended learning initiative.Designing a cybersecurity course for a big cohort of students from the different educational background is a challenging job. Examined in this study are the perceptions, preferences and performance of students who have participated in a strategic blended learning initiative aimed at preparing students for their working lives. For this purpose, both self-reported and observational data were collected from 115 students who voluntarily registered for the pilot run of the course. Self-reported data was used to measure students' preferences as well as perceptions related to satisfaction, engagement, convenience, interaction and views on learning. Observational data measuring students' performance was directly extracted from the collaborative learning platform on which the course was hosted. The results show that overall students liked the blended design of the course. They were satisfied with the format of the course, they felt engaged, and most of them secured good grades. Moreover, no significant difference in perceptions and preferences were found when controlled for gender, educational discipline, and overall performance, showing that the blended design of the course was accepted across the board.

Non-technical skills needed by cyber security graduates.Technical cyber-defence is often insufficient to protect a system as most cyber security incidences involve a human who takes an erroneous action or regrettable decision. To address the human factors, cyber security professionals need a range of technical and non-technical skills to enable them to effectively protect cyber-assets. There is research on the non-technical skills needed in ICT and engineering, but little specific to cyber security, and nothing in an Australian context. To support the job readiness of cyber security graduates it is necessary to identify the non-technical skills that are needed to be competitive in the modern cyber security market.To identify the non-technical skills needed or looked for by the Australian cyber security industry we ran an anonymous online survey. A range of demographic data was collected including gender, location, and role. Survey participants were asked about their use of non-technical skills, and the non-technical skills they seek when hiring junior staff. This paper reports on the most frequently sought after non-technical skills. A brief analysis indicates that some of the most sought after non-technical skills are neither explicitly taught nor explicitly assessed in most Master of Cyber Security degrees in Australia.With more and more Australian universities offering cyber security degrees, the findings of the survey can be used to inform cyber security curriculum design.

Cybersecurity Drill Test Using Phishing Attack: A Pilot Study of a Large Financial Services Firm in Thailand.This paper presents a pilot study about cybersecurity drill tests within a large financial services company in Thailand using a phishing technique. After conducting simulation by sending phishing emails to more than 21,000 users nationwide, including executives and employees, it has been found that 73% of executives and 77% of employees ignored the phishing emails, whereas, 12% of executives and 15% of employees opened, clicked and filled-in the password. The numbers are higher than the result from earlier research provided by Verizon. Therefore, the result from this can be used to increase awareness and improve the cybersecurity within this organization by proposing the training program to their staff, as well as conducting the other cybersecurity drill tests in future work. Besides, this study can be an example for other companies to improve organizational cybersecurity. cyberdrill. cybersecurity. phishing. risk. social engineering 
Interoperability of signaling interlocking and its Cyber-Security requirements∗. Today interoperability in railway systems is a worldwide necessity especially in Europe. Indeed, multiple systems control the mobility of trains through borders from one country to another one, yet the communication of railway signaling interlocking between these borders is still a challenge. Some projects deal with the interoperability issue. ERTMS is one of them: it ensures an exchange between interlocking and the train. EULYNX is another project that standardises interfaces between field equipment and computer interlocking. Our paper presents an approach for interlocking communication all along the architecture of computer interlocking. Indeed, due to the evolution of computer interlocking technology, we are faced to many architectures depending on signaling principles of each country and also the proposition of each actor in the industry. Our approach will dress a vision of interoperability that relies on the architecture of Functional Blocks (FB) related to IEC 61499 standard and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). this architecture allows an easy communication of relevant information but requires a high level of security.

Adversarial machine learning: Difficulties in applying machine learning existing cybersecurity systems.Machine learning is an attractive tool to make use of in various areas of computer science. It allows us to take a hands-off approach in various situations where previously manual work was required. One such area machine learning has not yet been applied entirely successfully is cybersecurity. The issue here is that most classical machine learning models do not consider the possibility of an adversary purposely attempting to mislead the machine learning system. If the possibility that incoming data will be deliberately crafted to mislead and break the machine learning system, these systems are useless in a cybersecurity setting. Taking this into account may allow us to modify existing security systems and introduce the power of machine learning to them.
Model-Based Systems Architecting with Decision Quantification for Cybersecurity, Cost, and Performance. The architecture selection process early in a major system acquisition is a critical step in determining the success of a program. There are recognized deficiencies that frequently occur in this step such as poor transparency into the final selection decision and excessive focus on lowest cost, which does not necessarily result in best value. This research investigates improvements to this process by integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) techniques. enforcing rigorous, quantitative evaluation metrics with a corresponding understanding of uncertainties. and eliciting stakeholder feedback in order to generate an architecture that is better optimized and trusted to provide improved value for the stakeholders. The proposed methodology presents a decision authority with an integrated assessment of architecture alternatives, to include expected performance evaluated against desired parameters with corresponding uncertainty distributions, and traceable to the concerns of the system's stakeholders. This thus enables a more informed and objective selection of the preferred alternative. We present a case study that analyzes the evaluation of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) providing satellite command and control with cyber security protections. This serves to define and demonstrate a new, more transparent and trusted architecture selection process, and the results show that it consistently achieves the desired improvements. Several excursions are also presented to show how rigorously capturing uncertainty could potentially lead to greater insights in architecture evaluation, which is a robust area for further investigation. The primary contribution of this research then is improved decision support to an architecture selection in the early phases of a system acquisition program.
Grid Cyber-Security Strategy in an Attacker-Defender Model.This paper uses the Probabilistic, Learning Attacker, Dynamic Defender (PLADD) model to analyze the evolution of cyber-attacks on a power grid infrastructure. PLADD was created to evaluate the effectiveness of moving target defense (MTD) techniques. We utilize the PLADD model to evaluate AND as well as OR configurations for attack scenarios in the power grid. The paper introduces a strategy that can help cyber-security managers optimize their defense strategies. Our analysis of PLADD games in AND and OR configurations provides mathematical proofs and insight into when access controls (such as passwords, internet protocol addresses, session keys, etc.) should be reset to minimize the probability of a successful attack. In particular, we provide a mathematical proof for the OR configuration of multiple PLADD games showing that it is best if all access controls for all of the PLADD games are reset at the same time. We also provide a proof to show that it is best (in terms of minimizing the attacker's average probability of success) for the AND configuration of multiple PLADD games that the resets are equally spaced apart. attack graph. cyber-physical security. cyber-physical systems. moving target defenses. periodic reset 
A Preliminary View on Automotive Cyber Security Management Systems.Cyber security is increasingly recognized as an essential topic for automotive systems, especially in the area of connected and automated driving. Upcoming regulation defines requirements for cyber security on multiple levels in the automotive domain in order to achieve type approval. On the organizational level, a cyber security management system (CSMS) which covers the whole vehicle lifecycle and ecosystem is required. In addition, an argumentation for the cyber security of each vehicle type for which type approval is requested has to be given. Due to the novel nature of these requirements compared to existing type approval requirements, a test phase is ongoing. The components and scope of a CSMS are an open issue. We give an overview of the requirements for a CSMS, identify approaches and gaps, and give an outlook towards a potential framework which can address the requirements. Automotive. Certification.

Towards Blockchain-Based Architecture for Smart Cities Cyber-Security.The rapid development of urbanization poses many economic, social and environmental problems. The smart city brings smart solutions that are effective and sustainable in different areas: transportation, environment, energy and government affairs. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the basis of the structure of a smart city to interconnect all devices together. At present, and despite the potential benefits presented, IoT is still not secure by design, making its applications particularly vulnerable to security threats such as: Confidentiality and data integrity. However, there is the risk of creating urban environments with compromised data. The Blockchain has recently been proposed as a revolutionary technology that can be integrated and resolves many vulnerabilities in IoT applications. In this work, we analyze the applicability of the Blockchain to ensure the security of the data transmitted and received by the nodes of an IoT network. The purpose of this article is to integrate the Blockchain with IoT to create a secure decentralized architecture to provide a secure communication platform in a smart city. Blockchain.

An exploration of disinformation as a cybersecurity threat.Disinformation or 'fake news' has continuously proven to be a pervasive threat in the digital space. The spread and persistence of disinformation especially in the social networking media sites currently factors as one of the most challenging threat for users and content administrators alike. Its ecosystem encompasses several attributing factors including but not limited to humans as information users and source, social communication model as its channel, current trust models in place as defense and guards against it, and finally the archival correction that may halt its persistence in the social space. In this paper, the author aims to explore the dynamics of the several interacting fields i.e. Psychology and Computer Science, their influence on its phenomenon, which provides an ideal interdisciplinary and holistic approach to its reduction and management. Another equally important section in this paper is its attempt to advocate to formally recognize disinformation as a cybersecurity threat for its prospective future categorization. The possible application of discourse analysis as a potential technological tool for its detection as solution is also discussed. Cybersecurity. Cyberthreat. Disinformation. Fake news. Informatics.

On cybersecurity education for non-technical learners.In this paper the topic of cybersecurity education for individuals who are not in a technical learning environment will be explored. There are currently several organizations that can certify an education program that is focused on cybersecurity or similar areas. However, for individuals who are not within the cybersecurity field, such as those who are not yet finished with their high school education, those who are within another discipline at the University or College level, or those who are outside of the education system entirely, then there is no such entities or guidelines for programs to inform them about cybersecurity and privacy related issues and topics. This does not mean though, that these individuals have any less of a need for some training in the basics of cybersecurity and privacy protection that will affect everyone's daily life. Since these individuals are not exposed to the curriculums that might enable them to recognize or gain an understanding of the reasons behind practices that are common place for everyone, such as password requirements, then there could be an even greater need for them to be exposed to it in a controlled and consistent manner. The need to understand the security and privacy concerns associated with using various services and devices will continue to increase as more devices become internet and network connected, more jobs increasingly rely on technology, and more of these connected devices are brought into homes.

UAE cybersecurity perception and risk assessments compared to other developed nations.Understanding perception and risk behavior of citizens in a particular country can influence policies that leads to creation of appropriate cyber laws that guarantees citizens' security and privacy in cyber related transactions. UAE cyber activity and perception data is compared with data from nine developed nations. Results obtained have shown that with respect to monetary loss due to cybercrime versus relative risk, UAE is at par with Canada. Combination of results obtained suggests a need for aggressive promotion of cybersecurity awareness program in UAE. Although digital maturity, access to Internet and cybersecurity awareness in UAE may be low compared to other developed nations, cyber risk behavior is comparatively the same as in other nine developed nations. One major contribution of this research is that methodologies are presented that can be used in developing cybersecurity assessment of cybersecurity risk behaviors, and comparison of cyber related risk behavior among countries.

A p2p environment to validate ensemble-based approaches in the cybersecurity domain.The main data-driven techniques for detecting cybersecurity attacks are based on the analysis of network traffic data and/or of application/system logs (stored in a host or in some other kind of device). A wide range of machine-learning techniques (and possible alternative configurations of them) have been proposed in the literature so far, for this purpose, but none of them has been proven to consistently overcome the others across different datasets. In order to ensure better accuracy and stability, the ensemble paradigm can be exploited as an effective solution for combining such techniques. However, as attack detection problems are hard to cope with and, usually, entail the analysis of large and fast streams of data, different types of ensemble (and of base algorithms composing the ensemble) should have experimented, exploiting distributed architecture to suitably reduce the high-execution times necessary to run them. In order to handle all these issues, a p2p environment to validate ensemble-based approaches in the cybersecurity domain is proposed in this paper. Two case studies are analyzed by using this framework, which concern the detection of intrusions in network-traffic data and of deviant process instances. Preliminary scalability results demonstrate that the framework is a viable solution for these challenging kind of problems. Cybersecurity applications. Ensemble-based Systems. P2p frameworks 
Cybersecurity of Inference in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks : Invited Presentation.In recent years, there has been a surge in research and development efforts on vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) with the objective to make driving safer. VANETS that share sensor data can provide tremendous improvements in this respect. Unfortunately, such VANETs are known for numerous security concerns and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper we focus on studying cyber physical attacks on VANETs which share sensor data among vehicles to track important objects, an important emerging topic that has received little attention. We develop an appropriate VANET system model along with attack detection methods that can find any attack that impacts tracking of important objects like other vehicles or pedestrians regardless of how the attack is launched. This includes attacks modifying hardware, software, sensor data, communications or anything else. We have not seen any similar work. We illustrate these ideas with numerical results for a specific efficient distributed tracking algorithm. We describe a attack detection algorithm and numerically investigate the performance.

Relating Factors of Tertiary Institution Students' Cybersecurity Behavior. Humans are majorly identified as the weakest link in cybersecurity. Tertiary institution students undergo lot of cybersecurity issues due to their constant Internet exposure, however there is a lack in literature with regards to tertiary institution students' cybersecurity behaviors. This research aimed at linking the factors responsible for tertiary institutions students' cybersecurity behavior, via validated cybersecurity factors, Perceived Vulnerability (PV). Perceived Barriers (PBr). Perceived Severity (PS). Security Self-Efficacy (SSE). Response Efficacy (RE). Cues to Action (CA). Peer Behavior (PBhv). Computer Skills (CS). Internet Skills (IS). Prior Experience with Computer Security Practices (PE). Perceived Benefits (PBnf). Familiarity with Cyber-Threats (FCT), thus exploring the relationship between the factors and the students' Cybersecurity Behaviors (CSB). A cross-sectional online survey was used to gather data from 450 undergraduate and postgraduate students from tertiary institutions within Klang Valley, Malaysia. Correlation Analysis was used to find the relationships existing among the cybersecurity behavioral factors via SPSS version 25. Results indicate that all factors were significantly related to the cybersecurity behaviors of the students apart from Perceived Severity. Practically, the study instigates the need for more cybersecurity training and practices in the tertiary institutions. cybersecurity. cybersecurity behaviors. cybersecurity behaviors of tertiary institution students. tertiary institution students 
Comparative Analysis of Finger Vein, Iris and Human Body Odor as Biometric Approach in Cyber Security System.Information security has become an indivisible part of the emerging Information and Communication Technology [ICT] applications. In particular, authentication plays an extremely important role in dealing with security. A review on the biometric authentication techniques and few future possibilities in the fields of Information security is presented in this work. The basis of biometrics is that an individual is identifiable by a few characteristic and physiological parameters. To affirm or determine the identity of any particular individual, most of the systems require personal recognition schemes which are distinctive and equally reliable. This assures the authentication of the people requesting their services. This ensures that only legitimate users can access the services and not anyone else. The use of biometrics also allows to establish or approve an individual's identity. The position of biometrics in the present field of security can be deduced from this work. This paper outlines a comparison between three different techniques and their advantages and disadvantages over each other. Comparing these three techniques, we were able to deduce that the finger vein recognition system showed a good balance in every aspect. Biometrics. Finger Vein. Human body odor. Iris.

Case study-based portable hands-on labware for machine learning in cybersecurity.Machine Learning (ML) analyzes, and processes data and develop patterns. In the case of cybersecurity, it helps to better analyze previous cyber attacks and develop proactive strategy to detect and prevent the security threats. Both ML and cybersecurity are important subjects in computing curriculum, but ML for cybersecurity is not well presented there. We design and develop case-study based portable labware on Google CoLab for ML to cybersecurity so that students can access and practice these hands-on labs anywhere and anytime without time tedious installation and configuration which will help students more focus on learning of concepts and getting more experience for hands-on problem solving skills.

Improving user experience for geni-based cybersecurity labs.GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) has been used in network research and education for more than one decade. However, very few institutions utilize the virtual machines (VM) deployed on GENI for generalized computer education. One major reason is the limited user interface offered by GENI VMs. In this poster, we introduce the desktop environment to GENI VMs, thereby widening the student base in computer education. Specifically, as the demand of Cybersecurity education increases, we show that by introducing the desktop environment to the existing flexible network topology, GENI becomes more inclusive in offering cybersecurity education to a wide range of students, ranging from entry level students, who are unfamiliar with command line interface, to the advanced students, who are interested in sophisticated network attacks and preventions. The preliminary student survey result shows that most students have no problem using GUI lab environment. Cybersecurity education. Geni. Graphical user interface 
What Are Cybersecurity Education Papers About? A Systematic Literature Review of SIGCSE and ITiCSE Conferences.Cybersecurity is now more important than ever, and so is education in this field. However, the cybersecurity domain encompasses an extensive set of concepts, which can be taught in different ways and contexts. To understand the state of the art of cybersecurity education and related research, we examine papers from the ACM SIGCSE and ACM ITiCSE conferences. From 2010 to 2019, a total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors.We discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security), and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well. The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset. Our results provide orientation in the area, a synthesis of trends, and implications for further research. Therefore, they are relevant for instructors, researchers, and anyone new in the field of cybersecurity education. The information we collected and synthesized from individual papers are organized in a publicly available dataset. Cybersecurity education. Iticse community. Sigcse community. Survey.

Introducing cybersecurity concepts in non-security courses through a pogil activity: A pilot study.Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities are used in many undergraduate courses. Their utilization in Computer Science courses is very useful in the delivery of fundamentals of computer science. The site https://cspogil.org/contains many such activities. Currently, there is limited amount of research published involving both POGIL and Security. As such we feel that this area is wide open for contributions. In this work we create a POGIL activity designed to introduce some fundamental Cybersecurity concepts to undergraduate computer science/information technology/information systems students enrolled in non-security-focused courses. The learners will get exposure to essential application security risks and reflect upon the concepts introduced. Through this POGIL activity students get exposed to exercises involving the first seven of the The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 Application Security Risks. We use PRE/POST survey methods to collect data from these courses and investigate students' engagement and knowledge gains resulted from this activity. Application security. Classroom activity.

KYPO4INDUSTRY: A Testbed for Teaching Cybersecurity of Industrial Control Systems.There are different requirements on cybersecurity of industrial control systems and information technology systems. This fact exacerbates the global issue of hiring cybersecurity employees with relevant skills. In this paper, we present KYPO4INDUSTRY training facility and a course syllabus for beginner and intermediate computer science students to learn cybersecurity in a simulated industrial environment. The training facility is built using opensource hardware and software and provides reconfigurable modules of industrial control systems. The course uses a flipped classroom format with hands-on projects: the students create educational games that replicate real cyber attacks. Throughout the semester, they learn to understand the risks and gain capabilities to respond to cyber attacks that target industrial control systems. Our described experience from the design of the testbed and its usage can help any educator interested in teaching cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems. Cyber-physical systems.

Integration and evaluation of spiral theory based cybersecurity modules into core computer science and engineering courses.Cybersecurity education has been emphasized by several national organizations in the United States, including the National Academy of Engineering, which recognizes securing cyberspace as one of the 14 Engineering Grand Challenges. To prepare students for such challenges and to enhance cybersecurity education opportunities at our large research university, we implemented an NSF-funded cybersecurity education project. This project is a collaborative effort between faculty and graduate students in the Engineering Education, Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CPE) departments at a major US research university. In this effort, we integrated cybersecurity learning modules into multiple existing core CS and CPE courses following Jerome Bruner's spiral-theory model, which has previously been used to reformulate several academic curricula. In this paper, we present our cybersecurity curriculum initiative, describe the spiral-theory based processwe developed to implement the curriculum and provide an in-depth description of four reusable cybersecurity learning modules that we developed. A core tenet of spiral theory holds to revisit topics as students advance through their curriculum. This work applies this approach to Cybersecurity education by carefully designing the learning objectives of the modules and its contents. For evaluating these learning modules we implemented pre and post-tests to assess students' technical knowledge, their perceptions towards the modules' learning objectives, and how it influenced their motivation to learn cybersecurity. Our findings are overwhelmingly positive and the students' feedback has helped us improve these learning modules. Since its inception, our initiative has educated more than 2 000 students and is currently being used to revise the affected courses' syllabi. Conceptual learning. Curriculum design.

A case study of a cybersecurity programme curriculum design, resource management, and reflections.Cybersecurity is an area of growing international importance. In response to global shortages of Cybersecurity skills, many universities have introduced degree programmes in Cybersecurity. These programmes aim to prepare students to become Cybersecurity practitioners with advanced skills in a timely manner. Several universities offer Cybersecurity degrees, but these have been developed ad hoc, as there is currently no internationally accepted Cybersecurity curriculum. Recently, an ITiCSE working group on global perspectives on Cybersecurity education developed a competency-based framework that aims to help institutions to implement Cybersecurity programmes. In this report, we present a case study of a Cybersecurity programme at the University of Auckland. We discuss how the curriculum and resource management of this programme evolved, and we present some challenges for the design and delivery of a Cybersecurity programme in the light of this competency-based framework.

A hands-on cybersecurity curriculum using a robotics platform.This paper presents a study where high school students were taught computing and cybersecurity concepts using a robotics platform. 38 students attended a week-long summer camp, starting with projects such as a simulation-only game and a simple autonomous driving program for the robots to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) and networking skills. They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange, and sequence numbers to prevent cyber attacks during robot operations.We used an evidencecentered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework was engaging to students, and it supported their learning. However, our intervention needs to be modified to help students learn networking concepts. Block-based programming. Computational thinking. Computer science education. Cybersecurity. Networking.

Curricular guidance for associate-degree cybersecurity programs.As projections of the shortage of cybersecurity workers grow, the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) has led creation of a set of guidelines for two-year cybersecurity programs at the associate-degree level, called Cyber2yr2020. The Cyber2yr2020 guidelines underwent two rounds of public review and comment with the StrawDog and IronDog drafts, and the final version will be released in early 2020. This poster presents the curriculum guidelines, provides perspectives on the use of the guidelines, and offers opportunities to highlight two-year cybersecurity programs by aligning with the guidelines in a program example.

Cyber secured: A serious game for cybersecurity novices.We developed an educational serious game to teach basic cybersecurity concepts to novices. An evaluation of the game on introductory Computer Science and Business students suggests that playing the game resulted in both short-term learning gains in cybersecurity as well as longer-term retention of the concepts.We also saw evidence that students who played the game had increased interest in cybersecurity, and students self-reported interest in playing the game to learn more about and assess their knowledge of cybersecurity.

Exploring Factors Affecting User's Cybersecurity Behaviour by Using Mobile Augmented Reality App (CybAR).In the field of cybersecurity, human behaviour is considered as the weakest link. Augmented Reality (AR) is one of top technologies that enhances users' experience by overlaying computational information into their reality. In spite of wide range of AR applications in different fields, there exists no AR application that helps to educate users and raise their awareness in cybersecurity aspects. In this paper, authors explore and apply gamification techniques to educate the users with the aim of raising overall cybersecurity awareness by developing a game based on AR techniques as an Android app called named CybAR. This work contributes in identification of the key elements that must be addressed in the AR game for helping the users to prevent cybersecurity attacks using Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT). TTAT enables the explanation of the engagement of individual users in threat avoidance behaviours and provides a framework at the user level. The paper also highlights the individual' differences that affect cybersecurity avoidance motivation and avoidance behaviour. Augmented Reality. Cyber security. Gamification 
A High-Level Comparison between the NIST Cyber Security Framework and the ISO 27001 Information Security Standard.This paper provides a high-level comparison between the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cyber Security Framework and the ISO 27001 Information Security Standard. Pros, cons and the advantages each framework holds over the other and how an organization would select an appropriate framework between CSF and ISO 27001 have been discussed along with a detailed comparison of how major security controls framework/guidelines like NIST SP 800-53, CIS Top-20 and ISO 27002 can be mapped back to each.

Cybersecurity analysis and improvement of bilinear systems against false data injection attacks.Cyber security becomes one of the major concerns for a broad range of cyber-physical systems (CPS's). In this paper, the CPS is modeled as a stochastic bilinear system with the extended Kalman filter used as the monitoring system to detect the attack. And the conditions of undetectable False Data Injection (FDI) are also derived to evaluate the impact to the system. This work gives a general analysis on the design criteria to improve the security of such bilinear CPS's. Finally, a boost converter is used in a case study which is modeled a typical bilinear system under cyber attacks. This work could provide useful insights into enhancing the power grid resiliency against potential cyber attacks.
Optimization of cybersecurity investment strategies in the smart grid using game-theory.With the increasing penetration of cyber systems in the power grid, it is becoming increasingly imperative to deploy adequate security measures all across the grid to secure it against any kind of cyber threat. Since financial resources for investment in security are limited, optimal allocation of these cybersecurity resources in the grid is extremely important. At the same time, optimization of these investments proves to be challenging due to the uncertain behavior of attackers and the dynamically changing threat landscape. Existing solutions for this problem either do not address the dynamic behavior of adversaries or lack in the practical feasibility of the defense models. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing investment strategies in the cybersecurity infrastructure of a smart grid using a game-theoretic approach. The attacker is modeled using various attacker profiles which represent the possible types of adversaries in the context of CPS. Each profile has certain characteristics to bring out the aspect of uncertain behavior of the adversaries. The defender is modeled with various pragmatic characteristics that can be easily translated to the real-world grid scenarios for implementation. These characteristics include the standards laid down by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) commonly known as the NERC-CIP standards. The game-theoretic framework allows us to obtain optimal strategies that the defender of the grid can adopt to minimize its losses against the possible attack threats on the grid. The concept is illustrated by a simplistic 3-bus power system model case study which depicts how the solution can be translated to practical implementation in the actual grid. Attacker model. CPS.

Performance Evaluation of Shallow learning techniques and Deep Neural Network for Cyber Security.The usage of Internet technology is drastically growing day by day. With this enormous raise, a considerable volume of data generated. Therefore, network security is also receiving its attention to secure from attacks. The intrusion detection system (IDS) performs an essential part in the particular domain of network security. This research work aims at evaluating the performance of shallow learning and deep learning methods, which are the subsets of machine learning algorithms. The implementation appropriately employed utilizing standard benchmark NSL-KDD dataset [10]. The experimentation involves 4 shallow learning algorithms and deep neural networks utilizing Tensor flow and python. The experimental results evaluated employing classification metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Deep learning. IDS. network security. NSL-KDD. Shallow learning 
The New Standard for Cyber Security.Historically, Cyber Security has been limited to software. Because of IPC 1782, IPC 2581, and IPC 2591, it is possible to know exactly what hardware is in any electronic device. Therefore, hardware can be part of the Cyber Security solution. In addition, by coupling the hardware and software Cyber Security approaches with the Framework for End to End in Situ Monitoring described in Section 9.5 of ETSI GS NFV-REL 004 V1.1.1 (2016-04), a comprehensive Cyber Security solution can be created. Implementing IPC 1782, IPC 2581, and IPC 2591 with a very innovative labeling system within a factory and across the Supply Chain will increase yields, improve Quality, and Improve Reliability, as well as, make these items much more predictable. In addition to productivity gains, implementing these standards across the Supply Chain will fight counterfeits systematically. Because counterfeiters are opportunistic and operate in the 'dark' by surprise attacks, they are like guerilla fighters in a sense. The best way to deal with this type of 'attack' is by taking a systematic approach and shining light, by sharing information, where there is currently darkness. Combining these three IPC standards with other technologies such as innovative tagging technologies, Blockchain, The Cloud, and Big Data Tools enable unprecedented productivity gains not seen since interchangeable parts enabled the Industrial Revolution, as well as, the ability to catch counterfeits in situ before the components go through the next process step in a factory. This can be done regardless of the path taken from the original manufacturing site to the next downstream manufacturer. The true beauty of this approach is that no single entity shoulders the cost of this solution. Variability causes yield, quality, reliability (quality over time), and product safety issues. Interchangeable parts enabled the industrial revolution because they addressed variability. What gets measured tends to get managed. This combination of tools enables a tailorable solution that is proportionate to the need and available resources. Therefore, this solution fits very well with Smart Factory/Industry 4.0, materially increases productivity, and can be utilized to create entirely new business models, as well as, a practical way to address the risk of counterfeits and Cyber Security for a very long time.

Cyber security in Research and Academics due to Social Media.Internet is undoubtedly a revolution in technology which has brought tremendous changes in communication. It has succeeded in creating a forum for research opportunities, assisted in communicating with people and has brought the world much closer. Gone are the days when people used to wait for hours, days and even months to get a message delivered. Social media has indeed made our lives much more easier and it has created opportunities to socialize and bond with different people irrespective of their location, social status or even their attitude. It would not be wrong to say that social media has enhanced research opportunities. There various social media platforms like LinkedIn, ORCID, ResearchGate, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc, could be an excellent method to promote ones research. Social media also assist in sharing our research work with a larger audience. Social media channels may also help you to access up-to-date information in your field, stay in contact with colleagues, and exchange ideas on different subjects. Many researchers and scientists know that social media platforms are a great tool for drawing attention to their work and interacting with the research community, many of them are still not using these resources to their potentiality. 'Social media really doesn't take that much time. I tend to use it mostly in the evenings before bedtime and in between meetings,' [1] asserted Santa Ono, president of the University of Cincinnati. Ono, who has over 69,000 followers on Twitter alone, is one of the most social media-savvy administrators in academia. However social media has disadvantages too. A research carried out to show that it leads to poor academic performance among the students. It consumes lot of time that should have been used to develop academic growth. It also leads to bizarre medical effects among the researchers who spend their time locating information online. It may affect their eyesight and other mental illness. Not only that, researchers also the victims of plagiarism. When the academic works of various researchers get published online, it gets plagiarized by other researchers who put it in their academic work. Therefore the paper would be purely theoretical and it would emphasize on the various opportunities that is available to a scholar through internet for enhancement of research opportunities and it would also bring out the drastic impacts which could be faced by a student due to social media and what could be the possible measures to curb these measures for its security. It would contribute to analyze the further scope of understanding the hazardous effect and taking measures to prevent getting victimized. academics. Research. Social media. social networking sites 
Developing and Analysis of Cyber Security Models for Security Operation Center in Myanmar.In counteraction to the increasing threat of cyber terrorism, the modeling to be predicted in guessing the predictive models for estimating the incidence of cyber-attacks for enterprise network in Myanmar are seriously needed. Although we need these models, there is no record of attacks, defenseless, outcome and threat to utilize the developing predictive models and authentication. The main purpose of this research is to determine whether SOC (Security Operation Center) manager uses cyber security model by using SOC results figures to prepare further cyber defense and incident response plan. The goal of this study was achieved by conducting experiments on various cyber-attacks occurred in security operation center of Industrial Control System (ICS). Attack. Blue team.

Aspects of Cyber-Security in Higher Education Institutions.The experience of recent years has brought to the forefront a problem that can affect our everyday life: cybercrime. In higher education institutions, this problem is quite acute due to the increase in the number and types of equipment that can be connected to data networks. This problem is also influenced by the nature of educational and research activities involving a large number of teaching staff, auxiliary or non-teaching staff and students as well as complex computing and research systems in various fields. Members of higher education institutions are may be victims of cyber-attacks of all kinds (social engineering, DDOS attacks, Trojans, viruses and worms), or the need to find win–win variants as easily as possible can bring some of these into cybercrime. Finding a restricted access variant with different security barriers is essential for the proper functioning of the education and research process in this type of institution. In this context, the research objective is to identify and classify the main threats and attacks on the data network, the various information and research currently faced by higher education institutions. These issues need to be treated with utmost seriousness because, in general, the annihilation of cyber-attacks is done after they have been done, thus completely or partially losing certain data, and the creation of security barriers could limit access by attackers to confidential information of the institution. The results serve to open a new research direction that leads to the development of a security management model tailored to academic activity. Cybercrime. Data network. Higher education institutions.

Hunting Dependencies: Using Bow-Tie for Combined Analysis of Power and Cyber Security.Modern electric power systems are complex cyber-physical systems. The integration of traditional power and digital technologies result in interdependencies that need to be considered in risk analysis. In this paper we argue the need for analysis methods that can combine the competencies of various experts in a common analysis focusing on the overall system perspective. We report on our experiences on using the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF) and bow-tie diagrams in a combined analysis of the power and cyber security aspects in a realistic case. Our experiences show that an extended version of VAF with increased support for interdependencies is promising for this type of analysis. Interdependencies. Risk analysis. Smart grid

Model Design of Artificial Immune System in Power Cyber Security Protection.A key factor that affects the reliability of the power system is the robustness that supports the power data transmission network and an important indicator for evaluating the robustness of the power cyber is whether it has active defense capabilities. This paper introduces an artificial immune system into the power cyber security protection, and uses the theory of danger to construct a power network with artificial immunity. An artificial immune power cyber security model based on the theory of danger is proposed, the mapping relationship between the artificial immune model and the cyber behavior in the power system is analyzed, and a new power cyber model with self-Adaptation, self-organization and high parallelism is established. active defense. artificial immune system. cyber security. the theory of danger 
Future challenges for cyber-security in a smart city environment in Indian context.Due to urbanization and for better living, people are migrating to cities. To accommodate this mobility of people and to provide better services, cities need to be migrated to smart cities by adopting smart technologies. A smart city uses ICT to enhance the quality of the urban population. With the increase in ICT, the extent of cyber attacks has also increased. Smart cities are more prone to cyber-attacks due to the number of connected devices, and attacks are becoming more complex and are sophisticated to identify. In this paper, we provided a detailed overview of smart cities and various types of attacks on smart cities. Initiatives are taken by various governments especially the Indian government to safeguard from various attacks also discussed. Counties can adopt the policies and work together to safeguard the smart cities. Cyberattacks. IoT. Smart city. Vulnerability 
The effects of human factor dynamics in cyber security in Kuwait. Human behaviour plays a significant role in computer security and ultimately associated risks. Human behaviour can be measured by many factors. In this survey, we use the following factors: omission, commission, extraneous acts, sequential acts, and time errors [1]. These factors are used to interpret the attitudes and behaviours of the human with respect to information security. and discover how the people behaviour is consistently referred to as the weakest link in security that may lead to huge harm to the organization and financial losses. We apply these factors on employees in Kuwait. Results and analysis will be clearly described. By the end of this article, recommendations will be provided as to how the human and cultural factors can be influenced to result in more positive behaviours and lead to more secure information environments.

Aligning with cybersecurity framework by modelling OT security.Before the last decade, production units and its related systems were considered nearly as island systems and were managed as an air-gaped in their daily operations. Information and network security was not an issue because their plant’s safety and continues operations have the highest priority. In the recent years, many initiatives like smart factories, adopting Industry 4.0, complex mesh of connected devices and data privacy have shifted paradigm of value chain and trust model in the production environment. By this means, state-of-the-art manufacturing environment demands for the comprehensive framework and holistic approach to address cybersecurity that affects reliability of plant operations. Therefore, few standards are gradually evolving and are extended in to this field. The ISA/IEC 62443 is one of the standard series addresses the Security of Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) throughout their lifecycle. On the other hand, NIST Special Publication 800–82 is a Guide to Industrial Control Systems Security and follows NIST CSF to address OT security. As with Operational Technology (OT) requirements in general, also considering to security-related requirements as per ISA/IEC 62443, ask for more effort to deal with it later. Accordingly, bearing in mind, the need for security from the beginning of the system engineering processes reduces the overall effort and complexity during the lifecycle of OT systems. The corresponding paradigm is called Security by Design. This paper proposes on how high level foundational security requirements from ISA/IEC 62443 can be modelled using AutomationML (AML) tool and consequently explains on how easy is to integrate seamlessly that model during the design phase of engineering process.

Socio-Technical Perspectives on Cyber Security and Definitions of Digital Transformation - A Literature Review. Most definitions of cyber security, or information security, refer to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. and focus has traditionally been on technical solutions. However, the argument that information security occurrences are best viewed as socio-technical problems has gained increasing support in recent years. Another current development relates to the increasing use of the term digital transformation. Consequently, there is a need for a broadened use of the term cyber security. one that includes management of risks related to human and organizational behavior in the development, implementation, and use of digital technology. This paper reports on the findings from a literature review on digital transformation and sociotechnical perspectives on cyber security. It shows that the term digital transformation is often used as a general notion without any associated definition. When defined, it points to a process, driven by digital innovations, that relies on and affects several aspects and actors within and outside the organization. The literature on socio-technical perspectives on cyber security was structured according to six categories: 1) strategy. 2) risk management. 3) incident response and investigation. 4) governance. 5) training and education. and 6) practices and behavior. There is a need for more research on (especially informal) aspects of cyber security in the context of digital transformation. research that takes into consideration challenges related to complexity and organizational change.

Experiences from implementing and testing an approach for cybersecurity event detection in a critical aviation system.Implementing cybersecurity solutions into legacy operational technology (OT) systems is a tradeoff. It provides additional operational awareness and early detection of cybersecurity-, as well as operational events, while introducing the risk of disrupting fine-tuned and fragile systems. Further, it consequentially adds additional requirement on the asset owner or organization to efficiently handle detected cyber and operational events. We present experiences from applying and testing a cybersecurity event detection solution in an existing critical aviation system. This work was done as part of the research of the project 'Holistic Approach for Enhancing Cyber security Competence and Services in Air Traffic Management' that investigates the protection of critical infrastructure considering cyber security in the perspective of people, processes, and technology. In this paper the framework for safe and secure implementation of detection technology in legacy OT systems is presented together with gained experiences from applying the methodology to an existing system. Further, a set of attack scenarios that were designed to test both system resilience to cyber-attacks as well as the detection capabilities of the detection solution is presented. The attack scenario tests were applied on the OT system and documented using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Organizing according to the framework functions (identify, protect, detect, respond and recover) we highlight how mapping the attacks to the NIST Framework supported the uncovering of both technical and non-technical cybersecurity aspects of both the target system and organization. Finally, we discuss the tradeoff between system risk and operational insights and awareness. Critical systems. Cyber-attacks. Cyber-security. Intrusion detection. Operational technology 
Clarification of the cybersecurity and functional safety interrelationship in industrial control systems: Barrier concepts and essential functions.Cybersecurity requirements for industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are aligned with normative documents like IEC 62443. This standard recognizes that a safety-instrumented system (SIS) must maintain the ability to operate in the presence of cybersecurity events, to avoid harm to people, the environment or physical assets. A SIS has traditionally been designed with only safety in mind, since the technology was proprietary and not connected to general IT systems. Standards on design and operation of a SIS, like IEC 61508, IEC 61511 and IEC 61513 have therefore focused on ensuring the functional safety. Today, a SIS involves also commercial technologies with far-reaching implications for remote monitoring, operation, and updating. Past cybersecurity incidents like Stuxnet and Triton have revealed that there may be motivation as well as resources to exploit new vulnerabilities. It is therefore necessary to treat safety and security in IACS in an integrated manner. Their mutual dependency cannot be ignored since the design allows more logical as opposed to physical access. Co-analysis methods can be found in Lisova et al. (2019) but are not yet applied to guide design or operation decisions in engineering practice. This paper presents how the mentioned safety standards address cybersecurity, and identifies requirements from IEC 62443 which may have an impact on how requirements in the safety standards are formulated. The research gives initial advice on how security and safety requirements are interrelated. Copyright . Critical infrastructures. Industrial automation and control system (IACS). Safety.

Addressing cybersecurity in Energy Islands.Addressing cybersecurity threats in energy island is about balancing technical infrastructure and assets risks with business needs and protecting data from unwanted or unintentional information disclosure. Every organization that implementing smart grid functionality address cybersecurity issues that are diverse and complex for the organization. Especially when relying on existing legacy systems and infrastructure when interoperate with new assets connected to the smart grid. This potentially introduces new operational risks for the operator. This paper summarizes identified cybersecurity risks relevant for energy island as identified during the development phase of the E-LAND toolbox. Some of these risks include the local energy systems operator's exposure of existing legacy operational systems infrastructure, security and privacy concerns in multi-cloud environments, asset hardening and integration requirements, establishing a common baseline for network security and best practices, and data ownership and management to name some. The risks are discussed in more detail and exemplified through general use case examples before suggested mitigations for the risks are provided. Copyright . Cybersecurity. Data protection. E-LAND.

Dynamic probabilistic risk assessment for cyber security risk analysis of the electric grid.Electric power systems are a major part of critical infrastructures. Rapid addition of digital systems in the electric power sector has increased opportunities for malicious entities to cause serious consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the risk profile of the overall system such that decision makers have appropriate information to make judicious investments in defensive measures. Current practices rely heavily on subject-matter experts. In this research, we propose a dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) framework for the risk analysis of the electric grid. The results of the analysis can be used to support decision-making in security resource allocation. DPRA provides a probabilistic tool to consider the uncertainties in system evolution. In this research, we focus on uncertainties related to the attacker's and the operator's behaviors, as well as system failure or degradation. The large number of system evolution trajectories resulting from the above uncertainties may lead to differing consequences, and therefore the risk metrics of interest can be quantified. We demonstrate the proposed DPRA framework on a modified version of the IEEE 14-bus system, which exhibits behavior representative of a part of a North American electric power transmission system.

Cyber security evaluation for nuclear I&C systems following software life cycle.With the development of information technology (IT), nuclear power plants (NPPs) have adopted the digital instrumentation and control (I&C) devices. Although there are many advantages as improved operation & maintenance and monitoring functions, it is vulnerable to cyber threat and then, the safety and reliability of the NPPs systems can be affected. For this reason, the Korean regulatory authority has suggested to control the critical digital assets (CDAs) of NPPs in technical, operational and managerial terms. Also, the software of safety system could be developed as the software life cycle. Therefore, the CDAs on NPPs should require cyber security assessments along with the software life cycle. In this paper, the regulation of cyber security assessments of Korea and the verification and validation (V&V) of software development life cycle were studied, and then the way to evaluate the cyber security of nuclear I&C system following software development life cycle was introduced.

Cybersecurity of safety instrumented systems in the context of digitalization: Some issues and challenges within oil and gas production assets.A safety instrumented system (SIS) is a combination of safety instruments and safety functions that are designed to detect, prevent, or mitigate hazardous situations. SISs are broadly used in the oil and gas industry and play a critical and integral role in ensuring process safety. With the introduction of intelligent oil fields and the implementation of integrated operations, there is a growing interest in the application of new technologies, for instance, remote control of safety-critical systems. New technological solutions have begun to appear with seamless integration of various hardware and software applications bringing new forms of operational concerns, particularly in security and regulatory terms. In general, safety and security level of SISs can be challenged by both hardware failures and software related issues with the potential for severe consequences. Compared to random hardware failures, software related issues can be more difficult to identify early. With the growth of digitalisation trends across the oil & gas sector, the potential implications of software challenges also gradually increase. After a very recent major cyberattack on Norsk Hydro, the cybersecurity issue has gained significant attention from authorities, operators, and service providers due to its significant impact on safety, production, and asset economics. Under the existing circumstances, this paper explores critical issues and challenges related to cybersecurity and reviews industry practices with regard to requirements in governing standards, for instance, IEC 62443 series. It also identifies some dangerous failure modes of SISs as examples that need due security attention in a digitalisation process. Towards the end, the paper elaborates on two main grounded-strategies important for assurance cybersecurity of SIS within the oil & gas sector. Copyright . Cybersecurity.

Measuring cyber security awareness within groups of medical professionals in Poland.The goal of this study is to measure the cyber security awareness of medical professionals in Poland, i.e. to verify whether healthcare specialists have knowledge and understanding of basic cyber security threats. This survey was based on the cyber security recommendations from the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The survey consisted of 23 single and multiple-choice questions divided into four parts. The results categorized the respondents and measured the level of cyber security awareness. Among the 620 persons invited to participate in the survey, 300 (48.39%) responded and answered all of the questions. The results show a an unsatisfactory level of knowledge regarding information security in Poland. The main conclusion drawn from the survey is that the quality of cyber security training among medical professionals should be improved and frequency of the trainings should be increased.
Cybersecurity investigations and digital forensics: Mini-track Overview.The continuous amalgamation of technology into everyday life is creating an environment that is conducive to encouraging cybercrimes. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important that organizations and law enforcement agencies have the capability to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations. Hence, corporate and legal responses that address the resulting concerns presented in this mini-track include 'DNA Feature Selection for Discriminating WirelessHART IIoT Devices' and 'Container and VM Visualization for Rapid Forensic Analysis'. These contributions highlight the growing need to investigate and address cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the broad context of today's information-driven society.
Unstructured data for cybersecurity and internal control.This paper proposes a research framework for studying the connections-realized and potential-between unstructured data (UD) and cybersecurity and internal controls. In the framework, cybersecurity and internal control goals determine the tasks to be conducted. The task influences the types of UD to be accessed and the types of analysis to be done, which in turn influences the outcomes that can be achieved. Patterns in UD are relevant for cybersecurity and internal control, but UD poses unique challenges for its analysis and management. This paper discusses some of these challenges including veracity, structuralizing, bias, and explainability.
Defending organizational assets: A preliminary framework for cybersecurity success and knowledge alignment.Cybersecurity governance is a critical issue for organizations engaged in a constant struggle to protect their data, brand, customers, and other assets from malignant actors. The nature of what constitutes successful cybersecurity practices and governance, however, is not yet clear, in part because an appropriate measure for cybersecurity success is not likely to be singular or simple. In this qualitative study, we explore perspectives of cybersecurity success through interviews representing various technical and non-technical roles across a variety of organizations, then provide a preliminary framework for understanding dimensions of cybersecurity success (financial, information integrity, operational, and reputational) as well as their associated knowledge domains and alignments.
Maritime cybersecurity: Meeting threats to globalization's great conveyor.This paper addresses the issue of cybersecurity in the global maritime system. The maritime system is a set of interconnected infrastructures that facilitates trade across major bodies of water. Covered here are the problem of protecting maritime traffic from attack as well as how cyberattacks change the equation for securing commercial shipping from attack on the high seas. The authors ask what cyberattack aimed at maritime targets - ships, ports, and other elements - looks like and what protections have been emplaced to counter the threat of cyberattack upon the maritime system.
Discrete control of response for cybersecurity in industrial control.Cybersecurity in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a crucial problem, as recent history has shown. A notable characteristic of ICS, compared to Information Technology, is the necessity to take into account the physical process, and its specific dynamics and effects on the environment, when considering cybersecurity issues. Intrusion Detection Systems have been studied extensively. In our work, we address the less classic topic of response mechanisms, and their automation in a self-protection feedback loop. More precisely, we address self-protection seen as resilience, where the functionality of the system is maintained under attacks, be it in a degraded mode. We model this as a Discrete Event Systems supervisory control problem, involving a model of the plant's possible behaviors, a model of considered attacks, and a formulation of the control objectives. We consider a case study, and perform a prototype implementation and simulation, using the Heptagon/BZR programming language and compiler/code generator, and targeting a multi-PLC experimental platform.

Multi-stakeholder cybersecurity risk assessment for data protection.To ensure the effectiveness of the adopted security measures and minimize the impact of security issues on the rights and freedom of individuals, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires to carry out a Data Processing Impact Assessment (DPIA). Such an assessment differs from traditional risk analyses in which the actor carrying out the evaluation is also the one interested in reducing its risk. Conflicts may thus arise between the need of protecting data subjects rights and organizations that shall provide adequate security measures while struggling with various types of constraints (e.g., budget). To alleviate this problem, we introduce the Multi-Stakeholder Risk Trade-off Analysis Problem, (MSRToAP) and propose an automated technique to solve their instances. We then show how this can help data controllers make more informed decisions about which security mechanisms allow for a better trade-off between their requirements and those of the data subjects. For concreteness, we illustrate the proposed on a simple yet realistic use case scenario. Copyright . Cybersecurity. GDPR. Multi-Stakeholder risk assessment. Quantitative risk assessment.

Cyber security of electric networks with energy storages.Modern Energy Power Systems (EPS) are characterized by a rather high share of distributed generation, renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS) operating under the control of smart devices. For transition to a qualitatively new level of power industry management, the developed countries create Smart Grids. An effect of sudden changes of loads, power flows in the lines, and changes in the generation, as well as other unexpected factors can negatively affect on stability and reliability of state of EPS as well as lower EPS flexibility that is one of the most relevant features of future energy systems. Use of ESS is one of the recognized options of maintaining the energy system flexibility. At the same time executing energy storages at an energy object and, moreover, their coordination using Internet-technologies globally increase cyber vulnerability of electrical network. At this paper different aspects of cyber security of electrical networks with energy storage units incorporated into them are shown and ways of their cyber resilience are considered. By arranging PMUs in power system nodes using ESS, awareness of the absence of cyber attacks can be increased. Copyright . Cyber security. Energy storage system. PMU. Smart Grid 
Cybersecurity based on IEC 62351 and IEC 62443 for IEC 61850 systems.The word cyber, originating from the Greek word meaning skilled steering or guidance, has taken on the modern meaning of using digital communications within and among intelligent devices to perform information gathering and commanded control. Information technology (IT) systems include networked communications among computers, business systems, and the internet. Operational technology (OT) systems include networked communications among industrial control system (ICS) devices performing automatic safety, operational, and monitoring processes. In this paper, established ICS methods and standards are used to design defense-in-depth cybersecurity methods for digital communications within an energy control system (ECS) communications network. The ECS communications architecture is a mission-critical ICS and is divided into multiple levels with unique requirements and features from the process up through the station and finally to the control center. Using these levels, it is possible to identify interacting cyber defense technologies, the levels at which they should be deployed, and which devices they belong to (IEC 62443 Part 3) instead of the arbitrary defense-in-breadth strategy of requesting that every device include every cyber defense technology (IEC 62443 Part 4).

Prioritisation and cost / benefit analysis of cyber security controls within existing operational technology environments. Protection and control (P&C) systems are critical to the operation of electricity transmission and distribution networks. The digitisation of the P&C systems has unlocked many new efficiencies and capabilities but has also brought with it new risks with respect to cyber security. The critical role these devices play in interfacing between the 'cyber world' and the 'physical world' makes them a target for threats for those who want to cause the greatest interruptions to a nation's electricity supplies. A cyber risk methodology using event trees is proposed to understand the benefits of different cyber security controls within existing substation environments. This moves the industry from a maturity driven and checklist based approach towards a risk driven one based on an understanding of cyber security threats. and allowing organisations to produce a cost benefit assessment which may support planned investment as well as providing a justified position when deciding not to invest in particular areas.

Cybersecurity maturity assessment of a critical infrastructure organisation – approach and obsvervations.Developing a cybersecurity program or a security management system that fits to a multidisciplinary organization is not a straightforward task. A company operating a power plant has a multidisciplinary staff such as operators, system engineers, IT/security team, management, who together coordinate to provide safe and reliable services. One must consider what cybersecurity means for each of the disciplines, i.e. their cybersecurity concerns, responsibilities and protection needs. For an operator of a control room of a power plant, the main concern is how a cyber-attack can impact the safety or performance of the plant that he/she is monitoring and controlling. Whereas handling the cyber incident in terms of identifying the system and vulnerability that has been compromised is a responsibility of IT/security team. In addition, if the organization is responsible for operating critical infrastructure, it is vital that the cybersecurity program is in line with the safety management system. One reason for this being, cybersecurity procedures or technology should not hinder the staff from performing their safety operations or functions. Therefore, incident handling processes and procedures introduced into such an organisation needs to align with the existing practices and organisational structures. This abstract paper will present the work done to investigate the state of the practise of cybersecurity at an organisation operating critical infrastructure. We will discuss the approach that has been followed to conduct the assessment, that includes using semi-structured interviews, NIST cybersecurity framework (2019), responsibility assignment matrix and maturity model. The assessment collected and analysed data on people, process and technology aspects of cybersecurity, in order to get a holistic picture of the cybersecurity posture. The interviewees belonged to both management and technical operations of the organisation covering strategic, tactical and operational perspectives. The paper summarises the key observations from the assessment including generic recommendations for improving cybersecurity program in critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructure.

Dynamic probabilistic risk assessment for cyber security risk analysis of the electric grid.Electric power systems are a major part of critical infrastructures. Rapid addition of digital systems in the electric power sector has increased opportunities for malicious entities to cause serious consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the risk profile of the overall system such that decision makers have appropriate information to make judicious investments in defensive measures. Current practices rely heavily on subject-matter experts. In this research, we propose a dynamic probabilistic risk assessment (DPRA) framework for the risk analysis of the electric grid. The results of the analysis can be used to support decision-making in security resource allocation. DPRA provides a probabilistic tool to consider the uncertainties in system evolution. In this research, we focus on uncertainties related to the attacker’s and the operator’s behaviors, as well as system failure or degradation. The large number of system evolution trajectories resulting from the above uncertainties may lead to differing consequences, and therefore the risk metrics of interest can be quantified. We demonstrate the proposed DPRA framework on a modified version of the IEEE 14-bus system, which exhibits behavior representative of a part of a North American electric power transmission system. The potential cyber-attacks on the system and the uncertainties in system evolution are described. The results, including the representative system trajectories and the risk estimations, are presented. Cybersecurity. Dynamic probabilistic risk assessment. Electric grid. Electric power system.

Experiences from implementing and testing an approach for cybersecurity event detection in a critical aviation system.Implementing cybersecurity solutions into legacy operational technology (OT) systems is a tradeoff. It provides additional operational awareness and early detection of cybersecurity-, as well as operational events, while introducing the risk of disrupting fine-tuned and fragile systems. Further, it consequentially adds additional requirement on the asset owner or organization to efficiently handle detected cyber and operational events. We present experiences from applying and testing a cybersecurity event detection solution in an existing critical aviation system. This work was done as part of the research of the project ‘Holistic Approach for Enhancing Cyber security Competence and Services in Air Traffic Management’ that investigates the protection of critical infrastructure considering cyber security in the perspective of people, processes, and technology. In this paper the framework for safe and secure implementation of detection technology in legacy OT systems is presented together with gained experiences from applying the methodology to an existing system. Further, a set of attack scenarios that were designed to test both system resilience to cyber-attacks as well as the detection capabilities of the detection solution is presented. The attack scenario tests were applied on the OT system and documented using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Organizing according to the framework functions (identify, protect, detect, respond and recover) we highlight how mapping the attacks to the NIST Framework supported the uncovering of both technical and non-technical cybersecurity aspects of both the target system and organization. Finally, we discuss the tradeoff between system risk and operational insights and awareness. Critical systems. Cyber-attacks. Cyber-security. Intrusion detection. Operational technology 
Clarification of the cybersecurity and functional safety interrelationship in industrial control systems: Barrier concepts and essential functions.Cybersecurity requirements for industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are aligned with normative documents like IEC 62443. This standard recognizes that a safety-instrumented system (SIS) must maintain the ability to operate in the presence of cybersecurity events, to avoid harm to people, the environment or physical assets. A SIS has traditionally been designed with only safety in mind, since the technology was proprietary and not connected to general IT systems. Standards on design and operation of a SIS, like IEC 61508, IEC 61511 and IEC 61513 have therefore focused on ensuring the functional safety. Today, a SIS involves also commercial technologies with far-reaching implications for remote monitoring, operation, and updating. Past cybersecurity incidents like Stuxnet and Triton have revealed that there may be motivation as well as resources to exploit new vulnerabilities. It is therefore necessary to treat safety and security in IACS in an integrated manner. Their mutual dependency cannot be ignored since the design allows more logical as opposed to physical access. Co-analysis methods can be found in Lisova et al. (2019) but are not yet applied to guide design or operation decisions in engineering practice. This paper presents how the mentioned safety standards address cybersecurity, and identifies requirements from IEC 62443 which may have an impact on how requirements in the safety standards are formulated. The research gives initial advice on how security and safety requirements are interrelated. Critical infrastructures. Industrial automation and control system (IACS). Safety.

Socio-technical perspectives on cyber security and definitions of digital transformation – a literature review. Most definitions of cyber security, or information security, refer to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. and focus has traditionally been on technical solutions. However, the argument that information security occurrences are best viewed as socio-technical problems has gained increasing support in recent years. Another current development relates to the increasing use of the term digital transformation. Consequently, there is a need for a broadened use of the term cyber security. one that includes management of risks related to human and organizational behavior in the development, implementation, and use of digital technology. This paper reports on the findings from a literature review on digital transformation and socio-technical perspectives on cyber security. It shows that the term digital transformation is often used as a general notion without any associated definition. When defined, it points to a process, driven by digital innovations, that relies on and affects several aspects and actors within and outside the organization. The literature on socio-technical perspectives on cyber security was structured according to six categories: 1) strategy. 2) risk management. 3) incident response and investigation. 4) governance. 5) training and education. and 6) practices and behavior. There is a need for more research on (especially informal) aspects of cyber security in the context of digital transformation. research that takes into consideration challenges related to complexity and organizational change.

Introducing a new dataset for event detection in cybersecurity texts.Detecting cybersecurity events is necessary to keep us informed about the fast growing number of such events reported in text. In this work, we focus on the task of event detection (ED) to identify event trigger words for the cybersecurity domain. In particular, to facilitate the future research, we introduce a new dataset for this problem, characterizing the manual annotation for 30 important cybersecurity event types and a large dataset size to develop deep learning models. Comparing to the prior datasets for this task, our dataset involves more event types and supports the modeling of document-level information to improve the performance. We perform extensive evaluation with the current state-of-the-art methods for ED on the proposed dataset. Our experiments reveal the challenges of cybersecurity ED and present many research opportunities in this area for the future work.
Addressing cybersecurity in energy islands.Addressing cybersecurity threats in energy island is about balancing technical infrastructure and assets risks with business needs and protecting data from unwanted or unintentional information disclosure. Every organization that implementing smart grid functionality address cybersecurity issues that are diverse and complex for the organization. Especially when relying on existing legacy systems and infrastructure when interoperate with new assets connected to the smart grid. This potentially introduces new operational risks for the operator. This paper summarizes identified cybersecurity risks relevant for energy island as identified during the development phase of the E-LAND toolbox. Some of these risks include the local energy systems operator’s exposure of existing legacy operational systems infrastructure, security and privacy concerns in multi-cloud environments, asset hardening and integration requirements, establishing a common baseline for network security and best practices, and data ownership and management to name some. The risks are discussed in more detail and exemplified through general use case examples before suggested mitigations for the risks are provided. Cybersecurity. Data protection. E-LAND.

Cyber security management systems for agricultural technology products a csms light.Recent years show an exponential increase in connectivity-also in the agricultural machinery industry. This not only brings advantages, but also brings with it the danger of increasing cyber risks. Although agricultural engineering has been little affected by such attacks so far, it is considered to be systemically relevant and therefore particularly worthy of protection. Current international regulations, such as WP.29 from UNECE, require the automotive industry to introduce and implement a certified Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) to protect the vehicles. In this paper we give a brief introduction to CSMS and discuss their applicability to the agricultural engineering sector-initially as a light CSMS. Core focus is on management concepts with regard to the culture, organizational setups for a CSMS and the cyber security framework (e.g. Risk Assessment, Qualification and Communication).

Cybersecurity awareness in the printing industries: Variable data and direct mail enterprises.The variable data printing (VDP), and direct mail (DM) markets are witnessing impressive growth due to its high adoption rate and rise in digitalization. This continuing trend toward designing and delivering individualized mail and targeted printed materials is dependent on accessing computer databases of personal, demographic, and geographical information. This increasing reliance on computer databases by these data controllers and data processors heightens the need for comprehensive approaches in expanding data security awareness and mitigating risk. In VDP and DM operations where production controls were relatively insecure in the past, there is now a heightened need for developing approaches to mitigating risk and implementing comprehensive contingency plans for responding to data breaches in these highly competitive industries. Furthermore, our educational centers associated with the diversity of graphics industries are encouraged to implement curriculum on security awareness and training for secure data management. Academic programs that ignore these dangers of not implementing security awareness are putting their students' reputations and future employers at a disadvantage. The goal of this report is to bring cybersecurity awareness to the graphics industry and those in academia on the increasing need for knowledge of the risks involved in keeping data secure. This paper has been developed by two faculty members collaborating on data security in the variable data printing and direct mail services. This work includes a shared focus on developing curriculum and educating students for careers in the graphics industry. It also includes working with industry partners in enhancing their variable data printing and direct mail services. This collaboration links the scholarly pursuits of those connected to the graphics industry with those in the information security of an increasing need for awareness of the risks involved in keeping data secure. With the increase of data breaches across the spectrum of industries and organizations that compile and use data, a heightened awareness of the risks involved in keeping data secure is the goal of this paper.

In this paper, a Data Flow Material Model (DFMM) is proposed for risk assessment in corporate server. The proposed model incorporates flow of data between various base station in real time server. The estimation is based on the collection of cyber attacks within the system and examination of the risk vulnerabilities. Based on the risk scoring, cyber risk classification of RT server, BPCS and HMI is examined. The proposed DFMM exhibited that attacks significantly prevented risk in control system. In test bed scenario, cyber attacks are significantly reduced. BPCS. Cyber security. Data flow material model (DFMM). HMI. Risk assessment. RT server 
An efficient classification of secure and non-secure bug report material using machine learning method for cyber security.In the field of software development, the main problem is to recognize the security-oriented issues within the reported bugs due to its inacceptable rate to provide the satisfied reliability on customer and software dataset. The objective is to propose a novel machine learning approach for multiclass supervised classification named Bug Severity classification to overcome these challenges with the use of supervised Artificial Neural Network and stacking based Navies Bayes classifier. This proposed approach directly examines the latent and highly descriptive features. Primarily, using the natural language programming approaches bug report text is preprocessed. After then, N gram is employed for extracting features by overcoming data sparsity problems. Further, the supervised Artificial Neural Network extracts the salient feature patterns of the corresponding severity classes. Finally, the stacking-based Navies Bayes classifier is employed for classifying multiple bug severity classes. Bug report. Classification. Cyber security. Data sparsity. Machine learning

Cybersecurity in pandemic times: Challenges and opportunities.In times of COVID-19 and isolation, many are the challenges related to a proper balance between patient's personal and sensitive data privacy and protection, and the need to use those data to better understand the disease and act in a more efficient and quick manner, to fight it. Some research is available on how to tackle a few of these issues in isolation, however, there is a need for a more comprehensive overview of what are the current security challenges, what is being done to face them, and what still needs addressing. Since the control of this pandemic depends on the actions of every individual, when there is no trust in the technology or services provided, allied to the fear and uncertainty of the current context, it is very difficult to provide an integrated and informed response to this disease.

Can trust be trusted in cybersecurity?.Human compliance in cybersecurity continues to be a persistent problem for organizations. This research-in-progress advances theoretical understanding of the negative effects of trust formed between individuals and the cybersecurity function (i.e., those responsible for protection), cybersecurity system (i.e., the protective technologies), and organization (i.e., those verifying (e.g., hiring, championing, vouching.) the cybersecurity department) that leads to suboptimal compliance behaviors. In contrast to the current information security literature that focuses on how organizations can induce compliance, this study begins to provide understanding into the degradation of compliance through organizational actions. Additionally, understanding is provided on how to combat the negative effects of trust. An integrated model is conceptualized using the theories of trust and attention. This model provides the theoretical foundation to study the role of dark side trust in the context of cybersecurity and provides initial mechanisms to reduce it. By developing this conceptualization of dark side trust and model, this study contributes to the general study of trust in information systems research outside of the domain of cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity in outer space: Combating perils of the final frontier.Over the last several decades, evolution of space technologies has led the world to be heavily dependent on space assets so much so that government policies and development plans are often dependant on the data collections by satellites. The strategic and civilian space applications have become an integral part of the current world dynamics. Today, satellites are instrumental in vital civil functions ranging from disaster predictions, remote sensing applications, navigation assistance, communication, broadcasting among others. Space ecosystem is often said to be the new frontier of warfare. Some experts go further to claim that a robust space ecosystem will be the determining factor in modern warfare. However, the present legal system governing outer space may be said to be lacking far behind the technological advancements. The international order still lack consensus and also fail to address various pertinent legal issues in outer space. Among other issues, the issue of security laws for space assets has not garnered required attention. Outer space security becomes all the more vital considering the importance of space applications not only in our day to day lives but also in civilian and defence applications. The technological prowess has also increased the capabilities to offensively target and destroy space-based assets of sovereign as well as the non-state actors by various direct and indirect means. The most prominent and convenient threat comes in form of a cyber offensive against space-based assets. Cyber offensive attacks may have varying impacts ranging from causing loss of communications to ground stations, making irreversible changes to the programming of satellites, changing the intended course of the satellites to causing collisions with other space objects. Evidently, space cyber-attacks give rise to civil as well criminal liabilities and have the potential to change the geo-political order for ever. However, considering these extenuating circumstances, the present legal regime governing cyber security in the outer space is grossly insufficient which needs to be addressed urgently to preserve the geo-political balance in the world. Firstly, the author aims to study the role of outer space in national and international defence arena. Secondly, the author will evaluate the efficacy and adequacy of the international legal regime to address the challenges posed by cyber-attacks on space-based assets. Finally, the author will recommend changes in the existing legal regime to ensure the efficacy in the international legal order for combating challenges to cyber security in outer space.

Do cybersecurity laws understand cybersecurity? - The case of threats against satellite systems.The increasing reliance of space missions on cyber infrastructure along with the growing presence of cyber elements in the development of space applications are exposing space systems to greater cyber risks. Whereas satellite systems are elevated to major targets of cyber threats, space big data applications and satellite network connectivity require reliable satellite transmission and storage. Therefore, the appropriate level of preparedness against such threats is essential to the continuation and advancement of applications connected to space systems. Even though laws are in place to ensure the protection of cyber operations, their scope might not extend to cybersecurity in space activities. The existing framework, despite its attempt to regulate the evolving cyber domain, focuses on remediating the impact of cyber incidents rather than establishing protection mechanisms against cyber threats. The relevant regulations encourage post-threat cooperation in sharing information and notification of incidents, but do not outline specific measures for preventing such threats or for lack of compliance with the prescribed level of cybersecurity. Furthermore, the definitions of information networks and cyber infrastructure these regulations provide do not adequately cover space systems, which might be left outside their protective scope. Finally, the difficulty in identifying the location of the perpetrators of cyber incidents, combined with the lack of uniform standards across the different regimes, impedes the achievement of sufficient level of cybersecurity. This paper will advocate that existing cyber-related definitions do not take into account the growing convergence of satellite technology in network and information systems, hence do not provide adequate regulatory protection from threats against satellites. Its purpose is to identify the legal challenges with regard to cybersecurity in space activities and suggest methods in which existing and future regulations could approach the protection of space technology from cyber threats. Toward this end, it will elaborate on relevant national, regional and international legal documents, as well as the rights and obligations they introduce. Ultimately, it will support that attention should be shifted to security requirements prior to the occurrence of a cyber incident, since identifying and attributing a cybersecurity breach is challenging in terms of both practice and regulation. Aiming to propose an appropriate regulatory regime, the paper will highlight that the strong connection between the cyber and the space domains should form the basis of effective regulations and policy strategies.
CriSEs: Cybersecurity for small-Satellite Ecosystem - state-of-the-art and open challenge.In the last 20 years, cyber-attacks to satellite missions increased exponentially, mainly exploiting vulnerabilities in the ground segment (mostly computer networks exploits). In the next decade, about 50 thousands of small-satellites will orbit around the earth, mostly as element of large constellations. These small-satellites, the ground stations and user segment services are produced by a global, high revenue, market by assembling and developing COTS and open source technologies, cloud computing services and artificial intelligence solutions. The adoption of this cutting-edge technologies introduces new vulnerabilities and threats, which increase the exposure to cyberattacks of the space and user segment. The analysis of the vulnerabilities and cyber-threats introduced by the use of cutting-edge technologies and by the policies adopted in the management of the small-satellite ecosystem supply chain reveal that there are many challenges to be addressed in order to implement secure small-satellite missions. Example of challenges are explainable AI, detection of adversarial attacks, self-protection and secure software/firmware updates in resource constrained environments. Cyber-threat analysis.

CYA: A legal perspective on how to do cybersecurity in space.This paper will address this issue of cybersecurity in the context of the space environment and discuss, from a legal perspective, what it means for a space operator to be cyber-secure. This paper will argue that cybersecurity law should be understood as a governance framework constructed from a variety of documents that includes traditional legal documents, but that also relies on policies, technical standards, and technical specifications. This paper will then discuss how a lawyer is supposed do cybersecurity for space clients, when the law itself is difficult to pinpoint.
How to estimate insurance coverage for cybersecurity protection for satellites: A case study. Cybersecurity is critical to maintain the global economic and military infrastructure. The common denominator here is that the world's infrastructure rests on the use and capabilities of satellite technology. As a result, this paper proposes the creation of a detailed risk analysis standard to be applied among the global space insurance market with an emphasis on cybersecurity. The first section of the paper serves to establish background information in regard to current trends in the space insurance market with regards to satellite costs, as well as common cybersecurity threats. The emphasis on cybersecurity threats of satellites cannot be underestimated. As cyberattacks by hackers are becoming more prevalent, there needs to be a proactive rather than reactive approach addressing cyberattacks to satellite systems because of how integral satellite use is to everyday life. The next section continues with a comparative analysis between space insurance and the general cyber security insurance regimes. While there is overlap between space insurance and cybersecurity insurance it is imperative to present the distinction in regard to cybersecurity protection for satellites in orbit. This section finds that cybersecurity insurance generally offers a range of tools for organizations such as prevention advice and mitigation support to build resilience in cyber related incidents. However, the novel nature of constantly evolving cybersecurity risks remains challenging for insurers to quantify and cover. Conversely, the space insurance market is roughly divided into three types of coverage: prelaunch, launch, and in-orbit insurance. In addition, the inherently risky nature of the space industry means that no one insurer is willing to cover a satellite. Despite this unique industry, this section finds that the space insurance market appears to follow the 'hard' and 'soft' cyclicality of conventional markets. The third and final section takes a proactive approach and offers a case study on how to estimate cybersecurity insurance coverage in the case of satellites. As the launch of satellites are expected to increase in frequency and size, the purpose of this case study is to create a uniform risk assessment stand to be applied among the satellite industry. Due to the sensitivity of information that is associated with space insurance, this section takes liberties with what may be included in the typical space risk portfolio such as: the possibility of total losses accumulating when several satellites are launched together. and wide range of insured values coupled with high exposure to total losses.
Cyber-security threats to space missions and countermeasures to address them.The EO market is in a rapid expansion and, more and more, EO derived products and services will be part of value chains that are different from their original ones. It means that each single step of the EO services value chain could be part of, and integrated into different market sectors. The more it happens, the more EO market needs to improve its maturity. Some fundamental steps towards the maturity are represented by the authenticity of the managed information and data, and the integrity of each processing step applied to them, from their acquisition to their delivery to the customer or the Service Provider. In fact, from the first appearance of the EO satellite data inside an archive under a Cyber Attack, the satellite data can be not only stolen but also, and even worst, be substituted by fake copies that can invalidate all the information to be extracted from them for all the customers and the EO service providers. That, of course, can occur in each processing step of the value chain. The problems aforementioned can be addressed in different ways, but a technology like the Blockchain seemed the best fitting solution to that. Moreover, from a technical point of view, the blockchain is a database relying on three fundamental concepts: Peer-to-peer networks, Public-key cryptography, Distributed consensus. By exploiting those characteristics, the EO market could go out of its niche and be integrated inside more complex and complete refactored value chains without the need of setting up redundant intermediation or overpowered centralized trusted authorities. In fact, in the context of the blockchain, data can be anything relevant or irrelevant, but most interesting use cases concern information that currently requires a trusted over-redundant third-party to exchange. In this context ESA awarded to Planetek the CTEO project, in which we designed a thin application layer (a library) that allows any client application (a piece of software that uses the library) to participate to a peer-to-peer network to exchange specific EO content by using dedicated smart contracts and exchanging signatures on EO imagery. The EO content is represented by any data related to Earth Observation activities, be the data the original satellite produced imagery, any value-added product (VAP), specific product metrics and metadata.

Blockchain technology for cybersecurity applications in the food supply chain: A systematic literature review.The food supply chain is a complex system responsible for the circulation of food products, and managing it requires IT infrastructures and technologies that are free of cyber-risk and that are used to connect, build and share information. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that can play an important role in providing data transparency, trust, immutability, integrity, and traceability to all food supply chain members. The purpose of this review is to depict a landscape of the scientific literature enriched by an author's keywords analysis to develop and test blockchain’s capabilities for cyber-risks prevention in international food supply chains. This paper combines a systematic literature review (SLR) process with the analysis of bibliographic networks. Papers from interdisciplinary areas published between 2016 and 2020 were selected to review the evolution of cyber-risks, cybersecurity solutions, and blockchain solutions used as a reference to identify, classify and specify requirements for a cyber secure distributed ledger. The findings show how blockchain technology needs other technologies, such as advanced ICT and Internet of Things (IoTs), for better food product traceability, safety, and transparency. It shows the multiple choices of blockchain architectures and their maturity level to interface with ICTs and IoTs. Based on the analysis of literature, research gaps, and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding the applications of blockchain technology for managing cyber risks in the food supply chain. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides an important contribution of literature with an SLNA entirely focused on the intersection between cyberrisks, blockchain and food supply chains that are continuously evolving, and shaping new supply chain models.

Disinformation as a strategic weapon: Roles of societal polarization, government's cybersecurity capability, and the rule of law. Disinformation through social media has emerged as a new form of cyberweapon for countries to advance their strategic interests. However, there is a conspicuous dearth of studies that looked into the possible impacts of foreign disinformation attacks in a country. Drawing on the media dependency theory, we seek to explore the relationships among the foreign disinformation through social media, societal polarization, government's cybersecurity capability, and the rule of law in a country. A quantitative analysis based on publicly available archival data substantiates our research model. The key contributions of this research include (1) adapting the media dependency theory to the context of social media in investigating the phenomenon of disinformation. (2) establishing that foreign disinformation through social media increases societal polarization, and reduces the rule of law in a country. and (3) establishing the vital role of government in mitigating the information operations from hostile foreign entities.

Casie: Extracting cybersecurity event information from text.We present CASIE, a system that extracts information about cybersecurity events from text and populates a semantic model, with the ultimate goal of integration into a knowledge graph of cybersecurity data. It was trained on a new corpus of 1,000 English news articles from 2017-2019 that are labeled with rich, event-based annotations and that covers both cyberattack and vulnerability-related events. Our model defines five event subtypes along with their semantic roles and 20 event-relevant argument types (e.g., file, device, software, money). CASIE uses different deep neural networks approaches with attention and can incorporate rich linguistic features and word embeddings. We have conducted experiments on each component in the event detection pipeline and the results show that each subsystem performs well. Copyright .
Cyber Security Canvas for SMEs. In an increasingly digitalized and networked world, information security and cyber security pose ever greater challenges to organizations. Cyber-attacks cause high economic damage and can bring organizations to ruin. Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are under the illusion that only the large companies are the victims of an attack. they protect their valuable data against this background only poorly. But even in research, the focus is generally not on SMEs. In the context of this work, an easy-to-use Cyber Security Canvas is therefore being modelled to close this gap and to allow SMEs pragmatic access to the topic. The model framework is supplemented with modular building blocks. The building blocks can be put together individually according to the requirements and needs of the SMEs using them, with the model dividing them up according to priority. The newly designed Cyber Security Canvas was put through an application test with a European-based SME in order to gain first insights into its practical suitability in the European context. The model proved to be successful, and was well received by the participant. Nevertheless, it has potential for improvement. Cyber security canvas. Security framework. SME 
Data Analytics of Crowdsourced Resources for Cybersecurity Intelligence.Cybersecurity incidents are always enduring hazards to organizations and enterprises. The increasing number of high exposure makes cybersecurity-related data a valuable asset, offering chances to identify trends, to make decisions and address challenges for cybersecurity end-users. While facing a considerable amount of data, it is challenging to seek out an agile approach that directly points out the most severe risks and provides security recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that begins with data collection, follows by representing information on the knowledge graph and finishes with offering security recommendations based on the systematic data analysis. It demonstrates the power of collective intelligence of social media community and cybersecurity experts and even hackers to monitor vulnerabilities, threats and security trends to further facilitate decision-making and future planning. Also, we develop a prototype to prove the effectiveness and deployability of the methodology. We applied Tweets containing the unique vulnerability identifiers to examine our tool. The analysis results indicate the tool enabling to point out the vulnerabilities with high priority and reflect the historical experiences on weaknesses. With the facilitation of public cybersecurity reports and databases, our tool can offer security recommendations for risk mitigation from various aspects that satisfy end-users’ requirement within cybersecurity.

Evaluating the cost of personnel activities in cybersecurity management: A case study.The methods of cybersecurity costs’ evaluation are inclined towards the cost of incidents or technological acquirements. At the same time, there are other, less visible costs related to cybersecurity that require proper recognition. These costs are associated with the actions and the time spent by employees on activities connected to cybersecurity management. The costs form a considerable component of cybersecurity expenditures, but because they become evident only during scrupulous analyses, often they are disregarded. CAsPeA is a method that enables estimating the costs based on a model derived from the Activity-Based Costing (ABC) and the NIST SP 800-53 guidelines. This paper presents the application of CAsPeA in a steel structures manufacturing company. Cost. Cybersecurity management. Estimation. Information security 
Cybersecurity Awareness Platform with Virtual Coach and Automated Challenge Assessment.Over the last years, the number of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems has been steadily increasing. Among several factors, proper software development plays a vital role in keeping these systems secure. To achieve secure software, developers need to be aware of secure coding guidelines and secure coding best practices. This work presents a platform geared towards software developers in the industry that aims to increase awareness of secure software development. The authors also introduce an interactive game component, a virtual coach, which implements a simple artificial intelligence engine based on the laddering technique for interviews. Through a survey, a preliminary evaluation of the implemented artifact with real-world players (from academia and industry) shows a positive acceptance of the developed platform. Furthermore, the players agree that the platform is adequate for training their secure coding skills. The impact of our work is to introduce a new automatic challenge evaluation method together with a virtual coach to improve existing cybersecurity awareness training programs. These training workshops can be easily held remotely or off-line. Artificial intelligence. Awareness. Capture-the-Flag. Cybersecurity. Secure coding. Serious games.

The Development of a Model of the Formation of Cybersecurity Outlines Based on Multi Criteria Optimization and Game Theory.The models based on game theory which enable to solve the problems of synthesis of information security outlines for information and communication systems (ICS) have been further developed in the article. To the contrary of the existing approaches, the one proposed in the article allows us to consider the situation not only with limited resources (financial, in particular) of the protection party, but also in the context of complex actions by attackers. The proposed additions and the development of game models of the interaction of the protection and attacking parties made it possible to develop a decision making algorithm based on a combination of several methods, in particular, expertise, game theory, etc. The practical value of the developed approach is confirmed by its implementation into the computing core of the decision support system for the selection of rational options of information security means (ISM) for ICS. The use of a decision making support system makes it possible to minimize the time spent on choosing rational sets of ISM according to ICS nodes under the conditions of implementation of complex attack scenarios by intruders. The developed approach is quite flexible in comparison with existing solutions, which allows you to simulate the behavior of intruders of different types and qualifications. Game theory.

Urban guided transport management cyber security.The Urban guided transport management cyber security is very important for human security and economic development of the Praha capital. The Urban guided transport management system (UGTMS) as subway, transports from several hundreds of thousands to million passengers per day. Intensity and irreplaceability of transport make from these subways the critical infrastructures of cities, regions or countries. Modern transport critical infrastructures contain in addition to physical and social parts also cyber control systems and they are marked as cyber physical systems (CPS). The CPSs are characterized by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. The CPS complexity, openness and dynamics form a large attack surface that may lead to failures and irreparable damage. Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) can meet the high system security requirements. The MILS is a high-assurance security architecture based on the concepts of separation and controlled information flow. The article discusses the possibilities of using the MILS platform in the data communication subsystem, which connects the individual UGTMS subsystems (Wayside subsystem, On-board subsystem and operation control subsystem). The communication system should guarantee transmission parameters and do not affect security level of the respective subsystems, accordingly. Critical infrastructures. Cyber physical systems.

Cyber Security Education and Training Delivering Industry Relevant Education and Skills via Degree Apprenticeships.The rise of Digital Transformation, global pandemics, and AI, have made Cyber skills crucial in today’s world. Organisation flexibility can only be achieved when they have a strong foundation of Cyber professionals that can look after vulnerabilities and protect their systems. A multitude of evidence suggests that the economy is being held back due to a skills gap, particularly in the Cyber Security discipline. In seeking to reduce this gap, the UK government has extended a long established ‘apprenticeship’ programme to include degrees. Higher Education Degree Apprenticeships offer a cost-effective route for employers to upskill their staff and for apprentices to access free education (and a degree) whilst being paid. Each of the Degree Apprenticeships has an associated framework that defines core learning requirements – devised and created by a collaborative effort of industry and academia. How this framework is implemented however is very much up to individual institutions. This paper presents an implementation of the Cyber Security Analyst degree apprenticeship undertaken at a UK Institution. Amongst the first in the UK to operationalise the standard, the approach has pragmatically dealt with a wide range of issues to create an academically rigorous yet commercially viable solution for industry. The paper presents the approach, demonstrates the academic rigor through mapping to industry-accepted standards, and discusses the collaborative role of the employer and University in providing a holistic and complete learning experience. The paper concludes by offering a critical discussion on challenges and opportunities and suggests ways employers and professional bodies can collaborate further with Higher Education in developing Degree Apprenticeships that will only be about skills, but also lifelong learning.
Towards an Heuristic Approach to Cybersecurity and Online Safety Pedagogy.Using a realist review approach from a qualitative and pragmatic perspective, the ultimate aim here is to develop a Cybersecurity and Online Safety (CSOS) pedagogical approach for Initial Teacher Training. The approach here is needs based whilst societally situated. It is primarily intended for the preparation of initial teacher trainees. However, this emerging approach could also be of interest to those developing CSOS educational programmes. The aim here is not to outline specific instruction for a particular online harm. Neither is it to provide further security instruction, for example, on how to manage passwords. The aim is to propose a theoretical approach to CSOS contexts, mechanisms and outcomes. From this the future aim is to curate a set of appropriate tools, or heuristics, that can be taught and utilised by lay people or experts to address established or new CSOS issues. The work considers the current education landscape and the CSOS issues. Using Friere’s pedagogical approach, the emergent themes are situated to the needs of the individual and society. The resulting theoretical approach should facilitate initial CSOS dialogues between educators and learners. These initial findings are surprising when situated alongside known pedagogies and theories. Cybersecurity. Education. Online safety. Pedagogy 
Cyber Security Challenges and its Emerging Trends on Latest Technologies.Today, due to the modern life style people have joined technology life and using more technology for shopping as well as financial transactions in their cyber space. At the same time, safeguarding of knowledge has become increasingly difficult. In addition, the heavy use and growth of social media, online crime or cybercrime has increased. In the world of information technology, data security plays a significant role. The information security has become one of today's main challenges. Whenever we think of cyber security, we first of all think of 'cybercrimes,' which expand tremendously every day. Different government and businesses take various steps to avoid this form of cybercrime. In addition to numerous cyber protection initiatives, many people are also very worried about it. This paper focuses primarily on cyber security concerns related to the new technology. It also concentrates on the new technologies for cyber security, ethics and developments that impact cyber security. android apps Social networks. Cyber security. cybercrime 
Estimating the Cost of Cybersecurity Activities with CAsPeA: A Case Study and Comparative Analysis.Contemporary approaches to the estimation of cybersecurity costs in organisations tend to focus on the cost of incidents or technological investments. However, there are other, less transparent costs related to cybersecurity management that need to be properly recognised in order to get a complete picture. These costs are associated with everyday activities and the time spent by employees on cybersecurity-related actions. Such costs constitute a substantial component of cybersecurity expenditures, but because they become evident only during scrupulous analyses, often they are neglected. This paper presents new developments on CAsPeA – a method which enables estimating the cost of these activities based on a model derived from the Activity-Based Costing (ABC) and the NIST SP 800-53 guidelines. The application of the method is illustrated by a case study of a civil engineering enterprise. The method’s evaluation based on comparative analysis in respect to SQUARE is described.

Guess Who? - A Serious Game for Cybersecurity Professionals.Cybersecurity education has been a challenge for organizations that rely heavily on digitization and automation. Despite the advent of technological advancements, human intervention still plays a significant role in mitigating increasingly complex cybersecurity threats. We have developed an interactive serious game to aid cybersecurity professionals by addressing two crucial aspects, that are: a) how to identify sophisticated phishing emails and b) threat hunting to detect insider threats using a simulated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. We have developed this game so that organizations can adapt it to their environment by creating custom scenarios. Cybersecurity. Insider threats. Serious games

Why are some Internet users more prone to adopt prudent cybersecurity practices than others?.In this first of its kind study, we use the regulatory focus theory to suggest that some types of internet users are more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats than others. A questionnaire based survey was conducted with 222 students of a large public university. The findings of the study show that users with preventive focus were more likely to adopt and implement cybersecurity best practices than those with promotion focus. They also reported lesser number of cybersecurity attacks than students with promotion focus. The findings of the study are not only useful to the student community but also to organizations that employ them currently or will do so in future. Future avenues for research are also suggested for identifying and securing vulnerable internet users. Cybersecurity attitude. Preventive focus. Promotion focus 
Cybersecurity: A definition across Europe and North America.The purpose of this study is to investigate if and how cybersecurity is defined differently across Europe and North America and how other concepts related to cybersecurity, such as information security and privacy, differ in the two continents. We believe that such analysis will help to create a new shared cybersecurity definition and to have a deeper understanding of the related information security and privacy concepts. We will carry our study through a systematic literature review methodology. This paper will have significant implications for IS researchers and IT managers. Cybersecurity. Information Security.

Applying text analytics to examination of end users' mental models of cybersecurity.Mental models can explain how end users perceive their interactions with information systems, and inform cybersecurity awareness training. In this study, we used text analytic techniques to extract mental models representing cybersecurity concepts in learners at different levels of expertise. We applied these analytic techniques to text data collected from open-ended questions designed to capture learners' understanding of cybersecurity concepts. We analyzed similarities and differences between learner groups using frequency, entropy and cosine similarity measures applied to n-gram features of their written responses. Our analysis showed that there is a difference in mental models between learners with informal exposure to cybersecurity topics and those with formal exposure. Furthermore, as a proof to demonstrate the predictive power of mental models, we correlated end users mental models with their perceived security. Finally, this study validated text analytics as a tool for capturing the mental models of end users without influencing the models. Content analysis. Declarative. Mental models. Perceived security.

A cybersecurity framework for acquiring and designing cyber-resilient spacecraft.Modern space Systems are complex combinations of government and commercial components from different countries. Cyber defense controls and components are well integrated into space operations. As one of the most complex and integrated systems of information and communications technology (ICT) in the world, the global space systems are potential targets for large-scale cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of satellites and other space assets to cyberattack is a major concern in the context of heterogeneous source of components and operational guidelines. Lack of universal space-centric cybersecurity standards and governance require a special attention to creating a cybersecurity framework based on initiatives. This can ensure the complex space systems are resilient to a cyber intrusion utilizing preemptive detection controls. This paper focuses on onboard intrusion detection and prevention systems, hardware/software supply chain, and onboard access controls that aim to provide stake holders with considerations while acquiring and designing cyber-resilient spacecraft. To maintain this high degree of confidence, it is imperative that the space operations community develop a common framework for governing the components of the complex heterogeneous cyber-resilient space systems. In this paper we present a comprehensive cyber defense framework for space assets and operations utilizing existing standards and guidelines and NIST, COBIT, and DHS cybersecurity frameworks.
Aerospace cybersecurity threat vector assessment.A major part of world’s critical infrastructure – such as communications, air transport, maritime traffic and trade, information services, weather and environmental monitoring and defense systems – depends on the space infrastructure, including satellites, ground stations and data links at national, regional and international levels. Satellites and other space assets, just like other parts of the digitized critical infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattack. Cyber vulnerabilities in space therefore pose serious risks for ground based critical infrastructure, and insecurities in the space environment. Cyber defense mechanisms are typically associated with more complexity in configuration, operational procedures and less optimal performance. Hence it is critical to assess the cyber vulnerability of space assets and the impact of cyber breach on any of them. Aerospace cybersecurity threat vector assessment is critical to estimate the impact of adverse incidences and necessary corrective actions. Prevention, detection, and corrective controls are assessed with quantitative risk assessment models. Aerospace cyber threat vector audit matrix is created with the help of graphical probabilistic models. As real time threat assessment indicators change, automated preemptive SIEM actions are taken. Threat vector assessment based on probabilistic models provide a mechanism to prioritize the cyber defense mechanisms and enables stake holders to optimize between cyber security, complexity of space systems, and operational effectiveness.
Cybergan: Generating high-fidelity cybersecurity data with generative adversarial networks.Machine learning for cyber defense offers the promise of detecting adversarial activity against the ground data systems managing critical space assets. A fundamental challenge facing machine learning research in cybersecurity is the lack of high-fidelity, shareable datasets for robust evaluation and testing of machine learning-based solutions. High-fidelity, real-world datasets are necessary for reliable benchmarking of nominal system behavior and malicious activity. Unfortunately, such realistic datasets of both nominal and adversarial activity are rarely shared publicly by data owners due to security and privacy concerns. Besides, the available adversarial data is sparse, which makes training models on malicious activity much harder. This situation has impeded and continues to impede the research and successful adoption of machine learning methods for cyber defense. Researchers have dealt with this problem by generating data within a low-fidelity lab environment, using classified and thus unshareable datasets, or downloading low-fidelity public datasets made available by others. We propose an innovative solution to the problem by employing machine learning methods to generate high-fidelity data. Specifically, we propose the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate high-fidelity data for cybersecurity purposes. GANs have found successful image processing and natural language applications, but have not yet been investigated for cyber data generation. Our proposed approach first involves training the ‘discriminator’ network of the GAN with a sample of real-world data consisting of malicious and nominal samples. We then use the ‘generator’ network to generate new high-fidelity data samples consisting of an appropriate mix of malicious and nominal activity. We demonstrate applications of our architecture by generating high-fidelity cybersecurity data containing both malicious and nominal samples. We thoroughly evaluate the fidelity of our generated data using heuristics and evaluate its usefulness for machine learning applications using three different datasets. Overall, our approach results in high-fidelity, shareable datasets.
Cyber security incident response in the utility sector.Executive Summary: Protecting endpoint operating technologies (OT) is an increasingly important challenge for the energy sector. As energy companies continue to digitize existing assets and build new assets with intrinsic network connectivity, they present an ever-expanding attack surface to escalating attacks. Trends show that cyberattacks on OT targets have increased in frequency and sophistication. Meanwhile, structural mismatches in the life cycles and maintenance cycles present a challenging business case for companies seeking to defend assets, rendering current cybersecurity best practices both technically difficult and potentially unaffordable to sustain. Overall, the energy industry has made tremendous progress in maturing cybersecurity capabilities. Yet current practices leave significant gaps due to lag between updates. Put simply, systems patched on Monday are powerless on Friday to stop attacks methods developed on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. To meet this challenge and answer both the technical and the business case, future cybersecurity solutions need to meet clear requirements: They must function while isolated, remain potent between updates, provide flexibility for deployment in unique, widely varied OT configurations, and must meet or exceed the cost-benefit ratio of current practices. We believe that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions offer these characteristics, as well as ancillary benefits. This paper will describe in detail the current challenges faced by energy companies, the implications of observable industry trends, the characteristics that potential cybersecurity solutions must meet, and why we believe AI and ML technologies can meet these requirements now and in the future.
IT/OT convergence - cybersecurity beyond technology.When the first PCs were deployed in industrial automation environments during the 1980s, it was difficult to imagine how the information technology (IT) would influence the day to day operations of industrial organizations. For the last decade or so, the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology has been an important topic in organizations whose operations rely on industrial control systems. The advantages of the IT/OT convergence are obvious - cost reduction, improved capabilities or greater efficiency. However, these advantages come with a cost as they have affected the way that industrial control systems operate and increased the exposure of ICS to cyber risks. According to one research study, nearly 90% of organizations with connected OT infrastructures have experienced a security breach within their Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition and Industrial Control Systems (SCADA/ICS) architectures, with more than half of those breaches occurring in just the previous 12 months.

Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Combatting Culture for African Police Services.Police forces are responsible to investigate cybercrimes and to protect their own assets from cybersecurity attacks. The majority of police forces find it difficult to fulfil their responsibilities in this regard in the face of constrained funding, a lack of awareness and training amongst law enforcement staff, the growing number of cybercrime incidences, and outdated or insufficient technology and infrastructure. Even if police forces are able to install technical controls to counter cyber threats, their staff members’ cyber behaviour may be a weak link in the cybersecurity chain and will probably not have sufficient training. The cultivation of a cybersecurity culture has been shown to be the best approach to address human behaviour in the cyber domain. There are several frameworks and other resources available for an organisation to cultivate a cybersecurity culture but the organisational culture in law enforcement agencies is different than that in other organisations. The cyber behaviour, cybercrime investigation skills, training and education of police force members require customised strategies and research. African police forces find it particularly difficult to deal with these challenges due to a lack of funding and a shortage of cybersecurity capability and capacity. This paper presents guidelines for African police forces to formulate strategies and plans to train and educate their members and to foster an organisational cybersecurity and cybercrime combatting culture.

Cybersecurity Training Platforms Assessment.Hands-on experience and training related to the latest cyberthreats and best practices, augmented with real-life examples and scenarios is very important for aspiring cybersecurity specialists and IT professionals in general. However, this is not always possible either because of time, financial or technological constraints. For cybersecurity exercises to be effective they must be well prepared, the necessary equipment installed, and an appropriate level of isolation configured, preventing inter-user interference, and protecting the integrity of the platform itself. In recent years there have been numerous cybersecurity training systems developed that aim to solve these problems. They can either be used as cloud or self-hosted applications. These solutions vary in their level of sophistication and ease-of-use, but they all share a single goal, to better educate the cyber community about the most common vulnerabilities and how to overcome them. The aim of this paper is to survey and analyze popular cybersecurity training systems currently available, and to offer a taxonomy which would aid in their classification and help crystalize their possibilities and limitations, thus supporting the decision-making process.

Teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts Using Game-Based Learning: A Review of Learning Games for Cybersecurity Education.When comparing game-based learning approaches for cybersecurity education with the Defence against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts we notice some similarities although they are not directly linked. Various game-based learning applications and learning games have been developed in the past but similar to the teacher’s curse in Harry Potter, they do not survive the prototype phase and hence, they are not available to the public. This work presents an extensive systematic literature and product review responding to two hypotheses as well as in-depth game analyses using a classification model for serious games. While we do not expect many games to be available for the target group of non-professional Internet and IT end-users without prior knowledge in Computer Science (CS), we also hypothesize that available games lack proper learning goals and do not teach sustainable knowledge and skills in CS. For our game analysis, we used the G/P/S classification model to gain insights on gameplay, purpose, and scope of the applications. The results include a falsified first hypothesis and indicators for the second hypothesis. In addition, the results of the game analysis are presented and discussed. Cyber security education.

States’ Capacity Building for Cybersecurity: An IR Approach.This paper discusses the current circumstances of security in cyberspace, such as cyber armies and cyber intelligence. Cyber intelligence plays a vital role in the balance of power. Most importantly, this paper explores previous studies of the International Relations (IR) theory of Realism. Cybersecurity can be applied as the equivalent of a nuclear deterrent of Realism and is inspired by the sense of the threat that allied countries felt in regard to cybersecurity. Countries utilize capacity building for military affairs, economics, and administration for cyber deterrence. Even though the circumstances of cybersecurity are deeply affected by the deterrence theory of Realism, concepts of capacity building for cybersecurity are derived not only from Realism but also from Liberalism and Constructivism. In the end, through this paper, I found that there is an interdependence of Realism, Liberalism, and Constructivism. Capacity building. Cyberattack. International Relations 
Blockchain as an enabler for cybersecurity use case: Electronic health records in Switzerland.In the application of Electronic Health Records (EHR), cybersecurity is an essential control and needs to be strongly considered to fulfil data protection requirements. Regarding cybersecurity needs in Healthcare, blockchain-based technologies seem promising due to the inherent security features. Therefore, this study investigates in cybersecurity requirements for EHR and whether a blockchain-based solution can cover these. There are already approaches which apply Blockchain for EHR, but these do not explicitly consider cybersecurity, which forms the research gap. As a unit of analysis, 'Hyperledger Sawtooth' as an enterprise blockchain platform was used. The results showed that Hyperledger Sawtooth performs quite well regarding the coverage of cybersecurity-relevant requirements for EHR. However, there are 'natural' divergences concerning specific cybersecurity attributes between blockchain-based and non-blockchain-based systems. The outcome of this study is a generic assessment tool which can be used to assess the coverage of cybersecurity requirements for both blockchain-based and non-blockchain-based EHR systems.

Conceptual Characterization of Cybersecurity Ontologies.Cybersecurity is known as the practice of protecting systems from digital attacks. Organizations are seeking efficient solutions for the management and protection of their assets. It is a complex issue, especially for great enterprises, because it requires an interdisciplinary approach. The kinds of problems enterprises must deal with and this domain complexity induces misinterpretations and misunderstandings about the concepts and relations in question. This article focus on dealing with Cybersecurity from an ontological perspective. The first contribution is a search of previously existing works that have defined Cybersecurity Ontologies. The paper describes the process to search these works. The second contribution of the paper is the definition of characteristics to classify the papers of Cybersecurity Ontologies previously found. This classification aims to compare the previous works with the same criteria. The third contribution of the paper is the analysis of the results of the comparison of previous works in the field of Cybersecurity Ontologies. Moreover, the paper discusses the gaps found and proposes good practice actions in Ontology Engineering for this domain. The article ends with some next steps proposed in the evolution towards a pragmatic and iterative solution that meets the needs of organizations. Cybersecurity. Enterprise architecture.

Machine learning for automatic assignment of the severity of cybersecurity events.The detection, treatment, and prediction of cybersecurity events is a priority research area for the security response centers. In this scenario, the automation of several processes is essential in order to manage and solve, in an efficient way, the possible damaged caused by the threats and attacks to the institutions, citizens, and companies. In this work, automatic multiclass categorization models are created by using machine learning techniques in order to assign the severity for different types of cybersecurity events. Once the machine learning algorithms are applied, we propose a mathematical formula to decide, automatically and based on a scoring system, which model is the best for each type of event. In addition, we present the scoring system applied over a real cybersecurity events data store, then the features are extracted from the usual registers that are collected in a center of response to cyber-events. The results show that the ensemble methods are the most suitable for obtaining more than 99% of accuracy. automatic. cybersecurity. machine learning. model selection 
CSKB: A Cyber Security Knowledge Base Based on Knowledge Graph.The access of massive terminal devices has brought new security risks to the existing Internet, so traditional cybersecurity data sets are difficult to reflect the modern and complex network attack environment. Therefore, how to realize the standardization and integration of cybersecurity data, so as to continuously store and update malicious traffic information under massively connected terminals, has become a critical issue to be solved urgently. Therefore, based on the knowledge graph, we built a standardized cybersecurity ontology, and introduced the implementation process of the cybersecurity knowledge base (CSKB) from five stages of knowledge acquisition, knowledge fusion/extraction, know-ledge storage, knowledge inference, and knowledge update, aiming at providing a reliable basis for real-time cybersecurity protection solutions. Experiments prove that the knowledge stored in CSKB can effectively realize the specification and integration of security data. Cyber security data. Cyber security knowledge base. Knowledge graph.

Automated Right of Way for Emergency Vehicles in C-ITS: An Analysis of Cyber-Security Risks.Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) provide comprehensive information and communication services to enable a more efficient and safe use of transport systems. Emergency vehicles can benefit from C-ITS by sending preemption requests to traffic lights or other connected road users, thus reducing their time loss when approaching an emergency. This, however, depends on a secure and reliable communication between all involved parties. Potential risks involve cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage. A major issue is the security process applied to provide C-ITS vehicles with the authorisations to exercise the right of way intended for emergency vehicles. This paper presents results from the research project EVE (Efficient right of way for emergency vehicles in C-ITS): Following the lifecycle and processes of the emergency vehicle and its on-board unit from installation to decommissioning, relevant use cases are subjected to an extended Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess inherent flaws that could be exploited by cyber-attacks. The results show that, while the technical provisions foreseen by the relevant standards in general provide strong security, detailed security management processes need to be specified. C-ITS.

Cybersecurity-related curriculum for diverse postgraduate cohorts: A case study.Cyber threats have highly increased over the last decade, including ransomware, identity stealing, etc. Ensuring the security of cyberspace is imperative and should constitute a top priority for society to promote its growth and support its sustainability. Educational organizations, worldwide, have recognized the need to educate people on cybersecurity. This need has driven educational organizations to design postgraduate cybersecurity curriculums to educate and train recent graduates and IT professionals. Having a diverse audience, with different experiences and backgrounds with regards to knowledge and practical skills, can greatly challenge the design and delivery of a cybersecurity curriculum. Moreover, the fact that blended environments are promoted, where a curriculum is delivered to both face-to-face and distance learning students, can challenge the curriculum design and delivery even further. This paper presents a case study, critically discussing the challenges in the design and delivery of an ethical hacking curriculum targeting diverse postgraduate cohorts in conventional and distance learning. Moreover, the utilized practices that have successfully addressed the challenges are discussed. The aim of this work is to assist curriculum planners and developers to deliver an enhanced teaching and learning cybersecurity environment. Curriculum design. Curriculum development.

What Do Users Feel? Towards Affective EEG Correlates of Cybersecurity Notifications.Security notifications attempt to change risky computer usage behaviour but often fail to achieve their desired effect. Though there are likely many causes for this phenomenon, information systems researchers have posited that emotional reactions to security notifications may play a role in its explanation. This work-in-progress paper descibes a study to create a baseline of electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral responses to security notification images by comparing them to known responses to the well-studied International Affective Picture System (IAPS). By creating such a baseline of affective responses to security notification images, future work can explore the effect of passive emotional reactions to security notification designs which would generate insight into effective design practices.

Cybersecurity analysis on pacs-dicom servers in chile.Today the internet and the interconnection of equipment are a fundamental part of all organizations, payment systems, SCADA systems, medical equipment and others, and all are interconnected to facilitate data processing and thus optimize the work on these. Services based on the DICOM protocol (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) are used in medical equipment architectures around the world, because this is the universal format for exchanging medical images. PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) servers use this protocol to communicate. The purpose of this work is to corroborate the information provided by recent research (2019–2020) regarding cybersecurity studies on PACS servers under the DICOM protocol, specifically the services that are operating in Chile. The experimental design proposed by this research allows the passive, that is to say non-intrusive, discovery of operating nodes in Chile, the categorization of these nodes, the analysis of the data obtained, as well as the validation to create information from thus evidencing the exposure of these systems. Due to this problem, questions such as the following arise: Does the exposure of the data indicated in the related investigations turn out to be verifiable? A diagnosis of the current situation in the Country would allow us to identify the exposure of vulnerabilities in these services? The following research aims to answer these questions, presenting an experimental search design and corroborating works presented in this area, which consider a specific geographical area such as Chile.

DevSecOps Pipeline for complex software-intensive systems: Addressing cybersecurity challenges.A major challenge for cybersecurity comes from new technology approaches that focus primarily on the benefits of implementation rather than on defining the governance and risk management changes necessary to establish and enforce appropriate protections. This challenge is especially important for the adoption of technology that impacts critical infrastructure and shared services, such as voting and defense. Researchers examined the challenges and the effective cybersecurity options facing Department of Defense (DoD) programs delivering cyberphysical systems and adopting DevSecOps. These researchers found a lack of broad understanding about the level of management and governance responsibility needed to define and use the DevSecOps pipeline. Adopting DevSecOps is a sociotechnical decision that links technology with operational process and practice. Researchers identified several areas that require cross-functional and organizational management attention to fit the pipeline for mission use and considerations to address for producing the system. This paper describes the case study and lessons learned to date. When a program adopts DevSecOps, it creates and supports two major systems concurrently: (1) the product the program was assigned to produce, and (2) the pipeline the program uses to develop and operationalize the product. Both systems need effective built-in security. In addition, neither the product nor the pipeline can remain static, so the cybersecurity of each must change to ensure sufficiency. The product expands with added functionality, which includes added vulnerabilities that tools and developers must address. The pipeline should be continually refined and improved as new tools and techniques better enable the consistent throughput of new features and capabilities. The focus on functionality and throughput is not sufficient for either system because the threat landscape changes constantly with new attacker capabilities. As a result, the need for improved tools to avoid and remove vulnerabilities from the product become critical. These tools must also be patched since they are software and contain vulnerabilities. As more data about the product is collected through the pipeline, it is critical to tap this information to improve the product and pipeline. However, the pipeline is not a single entity. It is a collection of highly configurable pieces built independently and assembled to perform together. The increased use of the DevSecOps pipeline to automate software assurance, cybersecurity, and safety compliance transfers the responsibilities for identifying and addressing pipeline and product risks to roles that were not involved in the past. For example, acquirers and maintainers of pipeline tools may now be responsible for the level of verification performed on the product and its associated effectiveness. If the criteria for tool selection remains focused only on cost, availability, and compliance, the expectations for this new responsibility could fall short of stakeholder expectations, especially if structuring the pipeline does not include stakeholder requirements. There is a lack of broad understanding about the level of management and governance responsibility needed to define and assure the responsible use of a DevSecOps pipeline. Our work is focused on bringing these under-addressed areas to light. Cybersecurity. DevSecOps. Pipeline. Risk management. Software-intensive systems. Tooling 
Emerging trends in elearning and mlearning from a byod perspective and cyber security policies.It is undeniable that the last years have been dominated by an extensive development of computer and mobile hardware/software and Internet access that has become more dynamic, powerful and affordable. This growth influences our lives in all its aspects but more importantly it influences, now more than ever, our education. The growing use of digital learning platforms blurs the lines between mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers and opens multiple possibilities for educational programs. Using different devices for eLearning and/or mLearning (from the first levels to Lifelong Learning) has become essential in our existence and with this, the need of using our own devices in the process of learning, in business, or in vast array of conncted domains. From a cyber security point of view, the BYOD perspective has a great future in education but also in the business area due to its benefits (in equipment cost or maintenance, human and time resources). Regardless of the benefits, however, studies have also identified issues concerning security (being connected from your own device but using the resources from different organizations), because most of those systems are open and interconnected, the security aspect is a challenge which has to be addressed. This paper highlights the trends in eLearning and mLearning and the extent to which using BYOD poses cyber security threats to educational organizations. Moreover, this article highlights a few possible scenarios that could represent the future of eLearning and mLearning based on lessons learned, best practices, cyber security practices and cyber security education.

Bridging the Cyber Security Skills Gap: Using Tabletop Exercises to Solve the CSSG Crisis.Recent breaches like the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 are evidence of the rapidly evolving cyber security threat landscape. They demonstrate the ability of cybercriminals to take down individuals and businesses efficiently. This is an indication that few companies can sustain these challenges due to a shortage of professionals with essential specialist cyber security skills. It puts into perspective the urgent need to train and nurture new graduates who possess the minimum qualifications and aptitudes required in the cyber security profession. This study investigates the current cyber security skills gap (CSSG). It observes that cyber security skills are high in demand, yet short in supply, with employers facing problems attracting skilled personnel to fill the ever-growing cyber security roles within their businesses. The study noted that while there are some attempts to address the CSSG through education and training, some recruiting managers held that many cyber security graduates lacked essential business sustaining skills. It observed that graduates focused more on technical skills like hacking while ignoring critical, practical, hands-on abilities. The study identified 5 features of the CSSG and argued that they can be addressed through a serious games (SGs) training approach. This method makes use of SG elements like tabletop exercises (TTXs) which nurture and enhance practical hands-on skills. TTXs enhance the development of skills like problem-solving, communication, teamwork and business processes understanding thereby enabling cyber security incident teams (CSIRTs) to conduct their daily activities unperturbed.

A multidimensional approach to cybersecurity for critical infrastructures.In today's society both people's everyday lives and organizations are surrounded by an increasingly digital world. The essential services in a society are provided through critical infrastructure. Their activity will in turn be increasingly dependent on digital technologies. ICT systems are designed and developed on the activity profile of the critical infrastructure sectors, such as the industrial, military, medical or financial sector. Therefore, the cyber security for critical infrastructure has become, as a multidimensional system, a strategic form of protection for a number of states and international organizations. Therefore, many states of the world, on the basis of certain criteria, have identified and designated their national critical infrastructures. Once they have been identified, there have been taken increased security measures, including in the area of cyber security. Cyber-attacks that target critical infrastructures also needs to be considered. Planned targets are analyzed to the smallest detail to find out the vulnerabilities of the attacks. Usually, the cyber-attackers target critical infrastructures in order to obtain the most valuable information and to affect the functionality of the services. In recent years, these types of attacks are characterized by complexity, persistence and advanced techniques, supported by key actors or state-sponsored actors. Cyber attackers are permanently looking to exploit any vulnerability, either it's technical, human or procedural. Therefore, considering these aspects, we can emphasize that establishing a strong security has long exceeded the exclusive assurance of a technical security. Thus, multidimensional is highlighted in several areas of interference based on a holistic approach to cyber security for critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructures. Cyber security.

The introduction of ethics into cybersecurity curricula.The article is devoted to the analysis of the problem of teaching professional ethics to future cybersecurity specialists. It is stated that professional tasks of cybersecurity specialists nowadays cannot always be solved using the identified procedures and guidelines. The dilemmas that arise are not always supported by the corresponding laws, rules or codified standards due to the much faster development of the technological basis compared to the legislative support of the professional activity. Thus, the cybersecurity specialists can face unpredictable problems that can require ethical awareness. The article analyses three international educational efforts in creating educational standards for the cybersecurity course: the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the Cyber Education Project (CEP), Cybersecurity Curricula 2017 and the role of ethics in each. As well as that, the article looks at the national educational standard for this course and the international experience of embedding ethics into cybersecurity curricula, suggesting that the introduction of the ethical component into the national educational programmes would benefit the educational process.

Method of forming a logical conclusion about legal responsibility in the cybersecurity domain.Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure's objects can have dire consequences, as our entire lives depend on the working capacity of such systems. In Ukraine, cybercrime provides for criminal and civil liability under the Criminal and Civil Codes of Ukraine, and under the Law of Ukraine On the Fundamental Principles of Cyber Security in Ukraine. A successfully implemented decision-making support system that can provide a conclusion of legal responsibility in the cybersecurity domain, namely, propose sanctions recommended in the case of an offence or multiple offences, can significantly improve the productivity of the Ukrainian cyber police. This paper explores the legal and organizational principles of cybersecurity in today's information society, and first time develops the method and production rules of forming a logical conclusion about legal responsibility in the cybersecurity domain, that are used to form the conclusion about legal responsibility, namely for the selection of a sanction or set of sanctions recommended in the event of a particular offence or multiple cyber-security offences.

Using ontology to assist in cyber security assessment of critical infrastructure in the energy sector: Brazilian perspective [Utilização de ontologia para auxílio na avaliação de segurança cibernética da infraestrutura crítica do setor elétrico: Perspectiva brasileira].This research project seeks to unify the cybersecurity terms of the fields of Information Technology and Operational Technology to organize knowledge of cybersecurity in the domain of the electric sector. It proposes the use of an ontology to build a conceptual model that considers terminologies from both fields and also cybersecurity requirements for the protection of critical infrastructure in the energy sector. In addition, it is expected that the use of ontology in cybersecurity assessments will enable a better understanding of cyber risk and the level of compliance with the cybersecurity best practices applicable to the energy sector.
Emulation methodology of programmable logic controllers for cybersecurity applications. A programmable logic controller (PLC) emulation methodology can dramatically reduce the cost of high-fidelity operational technology (OT) network emulation without compromising specific functionality. A PLC emulation methodology is developed as part of an ongoing effort at the University of New Mexico's Institute for Space and Nuclear Power Studies (UNM-ISNPS) in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) to develop an emulyticTM platform to support cybersecurity analyses of the instrumentation and control (I&amp.C) systems of pressurized water reactors (PWRs). This methodology identifies and characterizes key physical and digital signatures of interest. The obtained and displayed digital signatures include the network response, traffic, and software version, while the selected physical signatures include the actuation response time and sampling time. An extensive validation analysis is performed to characterize the signatures of the real, hardware-based PLC and the emulated PLC. These signatures are then compared to quantify differences and identify optimum settings for the emulation fidelity. Copyright . Cybersecurity. Emulation methodology. Instrumentation and control.

A cybersecurity framework for wireless-controlled smart buildings I: Two-position control.Due to the rapid development of telecommunication and network technology, wireless devices and systems (e.g., Siemens, Lutron, etc.) have more and more market share in residential and commercial buildings because of their many advantages such as easy deployment and maintenance. The wireless systems are open and flexible, but vulnerable to cyber-attacks since the data packets are transmitted by radio waves rather than by physical medium. The current cybersecurity system (e.g., Intrusion detection system) examines the data traffic to identify the anomalies in the network. However, it is unable to detect the attacks that tamper with the control logic or operating data, which results in the malfunction of the system. The project aims to cover the gap by developing an integrated cyber-physical security framework for detecting cyber-attacks in buildings. The paper reports the framework developed for a two-position controlled wireless system. The testbed for the study used is a wireless-based lighting system, which consists of a wireless occupancy sensor, an actuator for the light switch, and an open-source operating platform for system control and monitor. The data transmission over the wireless network collected by a sniffing device showed the unique characteristics (a cluster of data with a unique pattern) related to the status of the devices in the system. The developed framework examines cyber data transmission by using a finite state machine model to identify anomalous operations. The finite state machine model can use the cyber data (data transmission) to interrelate/map cyber information (unique clusters) with physical system status and control to identify the operation of the system in normal or abnormal conditions. The developed framework successfully and effectively detected a cyber-attack tested in the twoposition testbed. The paper provides the details of the cyber information on the wireless network, classification of packets for the status, and the integration of a cyber and physical model, the finite state machine model, and the cyber-attack test and validation.
Cybersecurity awareness in an industrial control systems company.This paper investigates the cybersecurity awareness levels of employees at an industrial control systems organization and measures their knowledge on the potential impact of cyber-related attacks on their systems through a case study. Attacks on industrial control systems as well as the information technology infrastructure which it relies on, are becoming a growing problem for governments and organizations. Cybersecurity policies of organizations are critical to ensure that industrial control systems environments are adequately protected. It is equally important for the organizations to ensure that their employees are aware of the cybersecurity policies and why they must be implemented. In many cases, however, organizations are faced with employees who are not aware of the potential cyber-related security threats posed to their industrial control systems, nor the impact these attacks might have. Results show that although employees understand the severity of cyber vulnerabilities their awareness is low. Awareness. Cybersecurity. Industrial control systems. Vulnerabilities

The agent’s memory stores information about typical reactions to information signals from receptors, as well as information about the state of effectors and available resources. It also stores programs for processing input information into control signals supplied to effectors and the results of reactions to a particular external situation, the number and variety of knowledge and programs stored in it, the degree of development of the internal model of the external world, and reflection options that determine the complexity and nature of behavior agent. The main components of the memory block are filter systems that provide the most important information for the agent, the internal model of the outside world, and the model of the agent itself. Purpose: to prove that using the FPGA platform guarantees programmable memory protection to maintain its level of autonomy and intelligence. The object of study: cybersecurity of sensor networks with protected memory Approaches: agent theory, machine learning Objective: To prove that the use of the FPGA platform guarantees programmable memory protection to maintain its level of autonomy and intelligence.

Fostering cybersecurity awareness among computing science undergraduate students: motivating by example.To a certain extent, it can be considered that cybersecurity has a PR problem. Despite all the campaigns and publicity surrounding the matter, there are certain age groups for whom the message doesn’t go through, either because it sounds too condescending or too technical. This is more of a problem for undergraduate students in computer science courses, especially if we take into account the potential academic and career development paths they may pursue, with many becoming specialized practitioners for areas such as software engineering or information systems design, despite lacking a solid background on cybersecurity and good development practices. Prior experience from the authors has shown that a purely theoretical approach to teaching the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity has several shortcomings, contributing to distance the students from the subject and, in some extreme cases, to foster rejection towards the topic. This is partly due to the fact that the involved formal and theoretical aspects can be quite demanding, especially in terms of subject diversity, involving concepts about operating system design, networking or computer architecture, among others. Presenting this information in an effective way requires taking into account the current level of knowledge expected from the students at a certain point of their academic path, as well as their level of maturity. Engaging the students is a key aspect that has to be central to any strategy. As such, this paper presents an approach to the subject of cybersecurity education at an introductory level, focused on a methodology that has been recently adopted by the authors, with a considerable degree of success. It is based on a hands-on strategy, focused on the vulnerability analysis of a commercial, off-the-shelf consumer IoT device (namely, an IP camera). Starting with a presentation of the Mirai botnet incidents, the authors proceed with a step-by-step dissection of the target device to identify its vulnerabilities and showcase their criticality.

Strengthening the cybersecurity of smart grids: The role of artificial intelligence in resiliency of substation intelligent electronic devices.The Executive Order 13800—Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure—issued by the President of the United States, calls for an evaluation of the readiness and gaps in the United States’ ability to manage and mitigate consequences of a cyber incident against the electricity subsector. In May of 2018, the Office of Management and Budget finished evaluating the 96 risk assessments conducted by various agencies and published Federal Cybersecurity Risk Determination Report and Action Plan (Risk Report). While the report embraced a broad defending forward strategy, it made no reference to smart grids or their vulnerable intelligent substations and did not address how federal agencies plan to respond to emerging threats to these systems. While the paper does not discuss how to attack the smart grids in the cyber domain, the contribution to the academic debate lies in validating some of the vulnerabilities of the grid’s substations in order for government, private industry, academia, and civil society to better collaborate in disrupting or halting malicious cyber activities before they disrupt the power supply of the United States and its Transatlantic allies. We also discuss how Artificial Intelligence and related techniques can mitigate security risks to cyber-physical systems. Until this technology becomes available, however, standardization of cyber security efforts must be enforced through regulatory means, such as the enforcement of security-by-design Intelligent Electronic Devices and protocols for the smart grid.

A change management perspective to implementing a cyber security culture.There has been an increasing prevalence of global cyber-attacks. Because of the possible breaches in information security, it has become pertinent that organisations change organisational and individual cultures to become more secure. However, there are challenges regarding the implementation of these processes within organisations. Organisations have become dependent on information systems, which stores large quantities of data and can be considered as one of an organisation’s greatest assets. Whilst employees are considered as the next important asset, their negligence, whether intentional or not, and due to their possible lack of knowledge regarding information security, have also become one of the biggest threats to information security. Employees often fall victim to phishing scams, malware and ransomware attacks. Whilst many consider the implementation of information security awareness initiatives as a solution to this impending threat, more often than not organisations utilize presentations to address information security awareness training. This approach has not been successful as the target audience has difficulty in retaining the knowledge, and this often hinders its proper implementation. Change management not only involves the change in processes and tools but also focuses on the techniques used to manage the cultural change within organisations. This paper ‘encodes’ awareness training for information security and cyber security from a change management approach and provides best practice approaches in changing an organisation’s culture from an insecure culture to a secure one.

Cyber security capacity building: Cyber security education in finnish universities.Cyber security in Finland is part of other areas of comprehensive security, as digital solutions multiply in society and technologies advance. Society may be developed through examining different complex issues and services. Even today, a broad range of different actors in society participates in cyber security work, both from central government and the private sector. Cyber security is one of the primary national security and national defense concerns. Cyber security has quickly evolved from a technical discipline to a strategic concept. Since cyber security has evolved from a technical discipline to a strategic concept, and because cyber-attacks can affect national security at the strategic level, cyber security must be looked at beyond the tactical arena. Cyber self-sufficiency is seen as a challenge that requires improved higher education, more research and increased support from companies to solve. Every country needs well trained professionals working in cybersecurity roles. These professionals are critical in both private industry and the government for the security of individuals and the nation. Cyber security capacity building can be measured based on the existence and number of research and developments, education and training programs, and certified professionals and public sector agencies. By all accounts, the world faces a current and growing workforce shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals and practitioners. A shortage in the global cybersecurity workforce continues to be a problem for companies in all industries and of all sizes. (ISC)2 (2019) estimates that together in 10 major economies the workforce total is 2.8 million and the global gap estimates are 4.07 million, so the global workforce needs to grow by 145%. Pursuant to the Finland’s Cyber Security Strategy (2019) National cyber security competence will be ensured by identifying requirements and strengthening education and research. This paper analyzes the know-how demands and needs of the cyber security (world?) which the different national and international actors of the cyber world present. The know-how demands and needs are compared with the cyber security education which is offered in Finland's universities. The paper is based on a survey conducted on Finnish universities and universities of applied sciences in 2018 and 2019 and on the analysis of its results. Cyber competence. Cyber education.

Artificial intelligence and its’ legal risk to cybersecurity. The risk pertaining to data and technology are continuously growing in scale and severity as the dependence on, and advancement in technology grows. The last decade has seen hundreds of cases of identity theft, loss of money and data breaches. It is estimated that by the year 2021, cybercrime losses may cost upwards of $6 million annually. Due to the constant risk of intrusions, the tech industry, businesses and government bodies must safeguard technology and data and this is where cybersecurity plays a major and critical role. It may be considered as the first line of defense against intrusions. The tools and techniques developed and supported by AI and machine learning (ML) are now expanding to cybersecurity to protect against cybercrime. There are many advantages in using AI-ML technology for cybersecurity but it is a double-edged sword. Just as AI cybersecurity technology may be used to more accurately identify and stop intrusions, the AI systems may be exploited for the commission of cybercrime. Cybersecurity is not an issue that a government can address on its own. it requires multi-stakeholders to work together in addressing the legal risk AI-ML technology presents to cybersecurity. The discussion is divided into two parts: Part 1 explores the beneficial use of AI cybersecurity technology. and Part 2 considers the harmful use of AI such as data breaches and the commission of cybercrimes. Cybersecurity and cybercrime are issues that cannot be separated from each other. AI-driven cybersecurity technology must keep pace with the legal risk that the use of AI in the commission of cybercrime poses otherwise it cannot effectively prevent, detect, respond to and recover from an intrusion. A preventative approach rather than a detection-focused approach should be applied to cybersecurity. The discussion identifies the legal risk that the use of AI for cybersecurity presents and how it may be addressed by means of ethics, policies and laws. AI-driven cybersecurity.

Cyber security: Trust based architecture in the management of an organization‘s security.The functioning of a modern society is based on the cooperation of several organisation, whose joint efficiency depends increasingly on trustable business processes. Trust is based on availability, reliability and integrity of ICT system data in the operating environment, whose cyber security risks are continuously augmented by threatening scenarios of the digital world. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can be seen a critical asset of organization. To prevent loss of customers the trust and that way revenue and money, as well as to protect organisational reputation, this asset must be protected from cyberattacks. Trust in cyber environment is critical factor for organization in order to contentiously run the business processes that the customers can count on. This article emphasizes the system view, the trust and the trust-based architecture measures as an essential part of organization cyber security management. The article integrates several basic standards and three decision making viewpoints as an organisation cyber security architecture framework. The cyber trust factors for organization have been also defined by the researchers in this article. We have also examined how the measures can be considered part of the organization’s process structures while creating trust in its operation within a dynamic cyber environment. Thus, the article recommends and utilizes the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) method in developing cyber security management practices. In order to put the measures into practice, the leadership of an organisation regard trust-enhancing measures related to cyber security as a strategic goal, maintain efficient processes and communicate their implementation with a policy that supports the strategy.

Cyber-informed: Bridging cybersecurity and other disciplines. A recent study by Cybersecurity Ventures (Morgan 2018), predicts that 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs around the world will be unfilled by 2021. In the United States, the demand for professionals with cybersecurity expertise is outpacing all other occupations (NIST 2018). These reports, along with many others, underpin the need for increasing workforce development initiatives founded in cybersecurity principles. The workforce shortage is across all cybersecurity domains, yet problems continue to persist, as the lines between combatants and non-combatants are blurred. Combating this persistent threat, which is a 24/7 operation, requires a more aggressive and inclusive approach. Higher education institutions are positioned to fully support cybersecurity workforce development. cybersecurity needs people with different perspectives, approaches, ways of thinking, and methods to solve current and emerging cyber challenges. This need is especially pressing when assessing the digital landscape — a tireless and ever-expanding connectivity supported by societal needs, and economic development yet compromised by the common criminal to nation-state sponsored felonious activity. Educators need to consider augmenting their approaches to educating students to include cybersecurity content. In this technology forward world, one that is expanding more rapidly than society and policy can react, increases the imperative for fundamental cyber defence skills. Accordingly, all students, no matter the major, should, minimally, understand the implications of good versus bad cyber hygiene. STEM graduates will require awareness of cyber issues that impact the security of programs, systems, codes or algorithms that they design. Operationally focused cyber-security graduates require a curriculum for careers dedicated to protecting and defending cyber systems in domain specific environments. In a world of Internet of Things (IoT), the ability for individual disciplines to understand the impact of cyber events in environments outside of traditional cybersecurity networks is critically important. This will provide the next generation defenders with domain specific cybersecurity knowledge that is applicable to specific operating environments. Cybersecurity curriculum.

Applications of epidemiology to cybersecurity. Epidemiology provides a novel approach to understanding cybersecurity risk. It provides a systematic model for the analysis of likelihood, consequence, management and prevention measures. While current research exists on the analysis of individual cybersecurity risk factors, there is a significant research gap on the collective interaction of these risk factors and their impact on the risk of cybersecurity compromise. Effective cybersecurity risk management requires the estimation of the probability of infection, based on a comprehensive range of historical and environmental factors, including system or network configurations and characteristics. The application of epidemiology highlights two fundamental approaches to increasing the efficiency and potency of cybersecurity. the requirement for comprehensive analysis of all cybersecurity risk factors, not just specific network vulnerabilities or uses, and the requirement for a centralised reporting, monitoring and data centre for cybersecurity incidents to inform this analysis, and facilitate a collective community response to mitigating cybersecurity risks. This paper discusses these applications of epidemiology to cybersecurity, to highlight the importance of research which combines these macro and micro-level approaches to provide a definitive evaluation of cybersecurity risk.

Pretraining and augmentation in named entity recognition task for cybersecurity domain in Russian [ПРЕДОБУЧЕНИЕ И АУГМЕНТАЦИЯ В ЗАДАЧЕ ИЗВЛЕЧЕНИЯ ИМЕНОВАННЫХ СУЩНОСТЕЙ ПО ИНФОРМАЦИОННОЙ БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ].The paper presents the results of applying the BERT representation model in the named entity recognition task for the cybersecurity domain in Russian. Several variants of the model were investigated. The best results were obtained using the BERT model, trained on the target collection of information security texts. This model achieved results, which were 15 percentage points of F1-macro measure greater than results of CRF, the best method in previous experiments for the same task and data. We also explored a new form of data augmentation for the task of named entity recognition. Augmentation. Cybersecurity. Named entity recognition. Pretraining 
Italian National Framework for Cybersecurity and Data Protection.Data breaches have been one of the most common source of concerns related to cybersecurity in the last few years for many organizations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, strongly impacted this scenario, as organizations operating with EU citizens now have to comply with strict data protection rules. In this paper we present the Italian National Framework for Cybersecurity and Data Protection, a framework derived from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, that includes elements and tools to appropriately take into account data protection aspects in a way that is coherent and integrated with cybersecurity aspects. The goal of the proposed Framework is to provide organizations of different sizes and nature with a flexible and unified tool for the implementation of comprehensive cybersecurity and data protection programs.

Assessing the Human Factor of Cybersecurity: Can Surveys Tell the Truth?.Survey-based measuring plays an important role in exploring human behavior. In organizational context, self-reporting of behaviors, attitudes, norms etc. can often lead to people responding in line with expectations rather than reality. Particularly when answering sensitive questions, respondents can disguise the truth for various reasons. This is called a social desirability effect (SDE) and poses a key problem in the field of behavioral studies because it can significantly bias the findings of research. A number of methods to prevent or detect SDE exist. The aim of the paper is to test selected techniques for decreasing SDE in survey-based measuring of information security behavior and to propose an improved scale, minimally susceptible to SDE. We used a cross-sectional survey design with a split-ballot experiment across three companies of critical infrastructure in Slovenia (n = 414). Four groups of employees received versions of information security behavior scale with different combinations of negative, positive and forgiving item wording. No universal group and item type effect of forgiving and alternating item wording was found with testing of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) scale. However, it turns out that the content of items matters because one of methods perform differently for different types of behavioral items. Moreover, the part of analysis showed that combination of forgiving and alternating item wording might be effective in minimizing SDE. Items with best properties were chosen to establish new information security behavior scale. The majority of items were chosen from groups with alternating item wording, especially the one combining positive and forgiving items. Alternating item wording.

Reinforced learning and robotic process automation based cybersecurity.Reinforced learning and robotic automation based software agents are designed to take autonomous actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. This paper explores the application of this technology in maximizing cybersecurity of complex aerospace systems. Preemptive cyber defense of complex systems require a focus on finding a balance between exploration of uncharted scenarios and exploitation of current knowledge in addition to traditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) based cybersecurity.
Application of blockchain within aviation cybersecurity framework.As manufacturing, operations and maintenance become increasingly complex in the aviation sector, a digital transformation is underway toward Blockchain technology, an open source digital architecture for related data and their histories. From maintenance, repair and overhaul to protection against global positioning system spoofing, Blockchain technology is making a major impact in aviation industry. This paper analyzes possible implementation of Blockchain technology within the realm of Aviation Cybersecurity Framework.
Aviation cybersecurity threat vector assessment.Aviation cybersecurity threat vector assessment is critical to estimate the impact of adverse incidences and necessary corrective actions. Prevention, detection, and corrective controls are assessed with quantitative risk assessment models. Aviation cyber threat vector audit matrix is created with the help of graphical probabilistic models. As real time threat assessment indicators change automated preemptive security information and event management actions are taken.
An analysis of aiaa aviation cybersecurity framework in relation to nist and cobit frameworks.As one of the most complex and integrated systems of information and communications technology in the world, the global aviation system is a potential target for a large-scale cyber-attack. To maintain a high degree of confidence in aviation cyber defense, it is imperative that the aviation community develop a common framework for governing the components of the aviation system. AIAA's Aviation Cybersecurity Framework in 2013 provided initial guidelines in this matter. NIST and COBIT frameworks are in wide use in various industries. In this paper we examine the Aviation Cyber Framework in relation to NIST and COBIT frameworks.
Integrating risk assessment with aviation cybersecurity framework.Risk assessment of aviation systems identifies the elements of the aviation system that we need to protect. It differentiates those areas that have only an economic impact from those areas that also have a safety impact. The timeliness required for responding to threats is critical and becomes a part of the risk assessment model. The risk framework for Aviation safety and security has changed in the current post Covid-19 environment. Quantitative techniques and probabilistic models help in developing composite risk score factors with many attributes. It forms an extended part of Aviation Cybersecurity Framework. In this paper we analyze various components of the risk extended Aviation Cybersecurity Framework in the post Covid-19 environment. It forms the basis of risk mitigation and confidence building for aviation in the current environment.
Effective cybersecurity awareness training for election officials.Cybersecurity awareness training has a bad reputation for being ineffective and boring [21]. In this paper, we show the contrary, namely that it is possible to deliver effective cybersecurity awareness training using e-learning.

Multi-sector assessment framework – a new approach to analyse cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.This paper presents a new approach to analyse cybersecurity challenges and opportunities, focused on the development of a new risk assessment and management framework. Such a multi-sector assessment framework should be able to evaluate and prioritize cybersecurity risks in trans-sectoral and inter-sectoral contexts. It leads toward proper resource allocations and mitigation actions. To achieve this goal, the analysis of existing risk assessment and management frameworks was performed. Also, an overview on common multi-sectoral technological challenges and opportunities were provided being derived from sector-specific use cases as well as transversal and inter-sectoral challenges and opportunities. As a result of this analysis the architecture of the ECHO Multi-sector Assessment Framework was proposed. The identified technological challenges and opportunities, multi-sector dependencies, and transversal aspects determine the input data for the new framework. The architecture is applicable in healthcare, energy, maritime transportation, and defence sectors, being extensible to others. The framework enables the definition of governance models or the design of cybersecurity technology roadmaps. Challenges and opportunities. Cybersecurity. ECHO project. Risk assessment framework 
Towards the design of a cybersecurity competence network: Findings from the analysis of existing network organisations.The increasing reliance of economy, society and state on cyberspace and proliferating cyber risks require not only technologies and qualified workforce, but also innovative organisational solutions. The European Union sees one such solution in the establishment of a network of cybersecurity competence centres. In the past two decades, the creation of collaborative networked organisations in other fields has proven its utility in sharing knowledge, resources and risk to exploit quickly emerging market opportunities. The major challenge in creating networked organisations is to provide long-term, effective collaboration through adequate governance and management. To support the elaboration of a solid governance model of a cybersecurity competence network in a Horizon 2020 research project, this paper presents the results of a study of 92 existing network organisations active in cybersecurity and closely related fields. It outlines the implemented methodological approach, the identification of two main types of business models depending on funding streams and degree of coordination among partners, a prioritised list of governance requirements, and prevailing governance models depending on member representation on senior governance bodies and decision-making principles.

Automating the Communication of Cybersecurity Knowledge: Multi-case Study.Cybersecurity is essential for the protection of companies against cyber threats. Traditionally, cybersecurity experts assess and improve a company’s capabilities. However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider such services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC, implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB’s hands-on skills, tools adaptedness, and the users’ willingness to documenting confidential information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing them to understand what they do. An SMB’s motivation to improve security depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the SMB’s business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate that automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption. Capability assessment and improvement. Cybersecurity. Do-it-yourself. Multi-case study.

An Institutional Risk Reduction Model for Teaching Cybersecurity.This work presents a model for reviewing the risks of institutions teaching cybersecurity. The work is based on efforts in this direction at Regis University and Adams 12 Five Star Schools in Colorado. These two institutions are described in a comparative case study reviewing the following four aspects of addressing risk: policy, adjudication, infrastructure protection, and curricular boundaries. The model is presented in a generalizable framework to facilitate risk analysis across the education of children in public schools, university level education, and professional development programs. This framework is not intended to supplement a traditional threat analysis program and not replace it. In addition to the specialized risks addressed here, institutions teaching cybersecurity are often perceived as potential targets for adversaries because of the schools as a pipeline to cyber defense activities, and because institutions teaching cybersecurity are part of societal long-term cyber defense strategies that confront criminal, nation state, and activist threats.

Education for the Multifaith Community of Cybersecurity. The demand for cybersecurity professionals is growing. Many cybersecurity academic and training programmes exist to prepare students and professionals for these jobs. The programmes cover many areas of cybersecurity with considerable overlap, but with different emphases. Some are highly technical and cover little non-technical. others do the opposite. Cybersecurity jobs typically require some technical knowledge, an ability to place security problems in a larger context, and an ability to communicate this information effectively and convincingly. The problem with treating technical and non-technical subjects as silos rather than recognizing the two are tightly related and need to be taught together. This paper shows how seven common cybersecurity frameworks and ten masters’ courses from the UK and US cover both technical and non-technical content. It examines the balance of technical courses, non-technical courses, and courses that mix both technical and non-technical material. It argues that these topics cannot be siloed, and their balance is critical to meeting the goals of the frameworks and programmes. Certifications. Curricula mapping. Cybersecurity frameworks.

ICS Testbed Tetris: Practical Building Blocks towards a Cyber Security Resource. Cyber attacks on Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) can be hugely detrimental to society, notably via compromising Industrial Control Systems (ICS) that underpin core CNI functions. In order to explore in-depth ICS Cyber Security challenges, testbeds are an essential tool, avoiding the need to experiment exclusively on live systems. However, ICS testbed creation is a complex multidisciplinary challenge, with a plethora of conflicting requirements. This paper, based on over six years of ICS testbed research and development that spans multiple diverse applications, proposes a flexible high-level model that can be adopted to support ICS testbed development. This is complemented by a baseline set of practical implementation guidance incorporating related and emerging technologies. As a collective, the model and implementation guidance offers a go-to guide for a wide range of end-users. Furthermore, it provides a coherent foundational structure towards establishing an online  living  resource, which can be expanded over time through broader community engagement.
An approach to train and evaluate the cybersecurity skills of participants in cyber ranges based on cyber-Risk models.There is an urgent need for highly skilled cybersecurity professionals, and at the same time there is an awareness gap and lack of integrated training modules on cybersecurity related aspects on all school levels. In order to address this need and bridge the awareness gap, we propose a method to train and evaluate the cybersecurity skills of participants in cyber ranges based on cyber-risk models. Our method consists of five steps: create cyber-risk model, identify risk treatments, setup training scenario, run training scenario, and evaluate the performance of participants. The target users of our method are the White Team and Green Team who typically design and execute training scenarios in cyber ranges. The output of our method, however, is an evaluation report for the Blue Team and Red Team participants being trained in the cyber range. We have applied our method in three large scale pilots from academia, transport, and energy. Our initial results indicate that the method is easy to use and comprehensible for training scenario developers (White/Green Team), develops cyber-risk models that facilitate real-time evaluation of participants in training scenarios, and produces useful feedback to the participants (Blue/Red Team) in terms of strengths and weaknesses regarding cybersecurity skills.

National cybersecurity capacity building framework for countries in a transitional phase.Building cybersecurity capacity has become increasingly a subject of global concern in both stable countries and those countries in a transitional phase. National and international Research & Technology Organisations (RTOs) have developed a plethora of guidelines and frameworks to help with the development of a national cybersecurity framework. Current state-of-art literature provides guidelines for developing national cybersecurity frameworks but, relatively little research has focussed on the context of cybersecurity capacity building especially for countries in the transitional stage. This paper proposes a National Cybersecurity Capacity Building Framework (NCCBF) that relies on a variety of existing standards, guidelines, and practices to enable countries in a transitional phase to transform their current cybersecurity posture by applying activities that reflect desired outcomes. The NCCBF provides stability against unquantifiable threats and enhances security by embedding leading and lagging performance security measures at a national level. The NCCBF is inspired by a Design Science Research methodology (DSR) and guided by utilising enterprise architectures, business process and modelling approaches. Furthermore, the NCCBF has been evaluated by a focus group against a structured set of criteria. The evaluation demonstrated the valuable contribution of the NCCBF’s in representing the challenges in National Cybersecurity Capacity Building and the complexities associated to the build.

Public-private partnership in cybersecurity. The analysis of the possibility of providing cybersecurity through the use of public-private partnership (PPP) mechanisms is made. Public-private partnership is increasingly seen as addressing many of the challenges posed by cybersecurity management. Cybersecurity is intended to protect critical infrastructure and other important public functions against a variety of complex threats and is a central problem in today's security policy. In the process of implementing PPP cybersecurity, the state shifts the focus from control functions towards coordinating and motivating the fulfillment of security tasks by a private partner. Tasks to be addressed by public-private partnerships in cybersecurity are following: ensuring reliable access to the Internet. technical safety regulation. exchange of information on threats. assistance in resolving threat situations.

Alert characterization by non-expert users in a cybersecurity virtual environment: A usability study.Although cybersecurity is a domain where data analysis and training are considered of the highest importance, few virtual environments for cybersecurity are specifically developed, while they are used efficiently in other domains to tackle these issues. By taking into account cyber analysts’ practices and tasks, we have proposed the 3D Cyber Common Operational Picture model (3D CyberCOP), that aims at mediating analysts’ activities into a Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE), in which users can perform alert analysis scenarios. In this article, we present a usability study we have performed with non-expert users. We have proposed three virtual environments (a graph-based, an office-based, and the coupling of the two previous ones) in which users should perform a simplified alert analysis scenario based on the WannaCry ransomware. In these environments, users must switch between three views (alert, cyber and physical ones) which all contain different kinds of data sources. These data have to be used to perform the investigations and to determine if alerts are due to malicious activities or if they are caused by false positives. We have had 30 users, with no prior knowledge in cybersecurity. They have performed very well at the cybersecurity task and they have managed to interact and navigate easily. SUS usability scores were above 70 for the three environments and users have shown a preference towards the coupled environment, which was considered more practical and useful. Cyber security.

Design of secure coding challenges for cybersecurity education in the industry.According to a recent survey with more than 4000 software developers, less than half of developers can spot security holes. As a result, software products present a low-security quality expressed by vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber-criminals. This lack of quality and security is particularly dangerous if the software which contains the vulnerabilities is deployed in critical infrastructures. Serious games, and in particular, Capture-the-Flag (CTF) events, have shown promising results in improving secure coding awareness of software developers in the industry. The challenges in the CTF event, to be useful, must be adequately designed to address the target group. This paper presents novel contributions by investigating which challenge types are adequate to improve software developers’ ability to write secure code in an industrial context. We propose 1) six challenge types usable in the industry context, and 2) a structure for the CTF challenges. Our investigation also presents results on 3) how to include hints and penalties into the cyber-security challenges. We evaluated our work through a survey with security experts. While our results show that traditional challenge types seem to be adequate, they also reveal a new class of challenges based on code entry and interaction with an automated coach. Capture-the-flag.

Drafting a cybersecurity framework profile for smart grids in EU: A goal-based methodology.As for any other Critical Infrastructure, the design and implementation of a Smart Grid shall satisfy the demand for a strong security posture, while complying with regulatory requirements and maintaining an high level of interoperability among heterogeneous components. In this paper, we provide a goal-based methodology to ensure the fulfillment of the relevant security goals at design time. The methodology enables system architects to devise an adequate set of countermeasures in view of the selected security goals. In order to obtain a cybersecurity profile suitable for the protection of Smart Grids and in particular for Virtual power Plants in Europe, we build upon best practices and accepted standards, such as the security posture defined by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the ISO standards that are widely adopted by the EU Critical Infrastructure. In addition, we provide some informative references to demonstrate how they can these frameworks and standards can be integrated into the proposed methodology. Cybersecurity framework. Goal-based.

Developing and evaluating a hackathon approach to foster cyber security learning.Securing information systems and teaching people about how to use them securely is one of the significant challenges of the coming years. There is, however, a considerable lack of feasible approaches to train potential future professionals on security. Hackathons appear to be a good approach because studies have found them to not only be useful to teach participants but also to encourage people to explore the security of information systems. Such benefits cannot materialize without careful planning though. In our paper, we propose and evaluate a set of interventions aimed at fostering security learning amongst hackathon participants. Evaluating our approach, we found that emphasizing the need for idea generation, introducing security talks relevant to the ideas generated, interaction with mentors that come from diverse backgrounds, and the introduction of incentives can encourage security learning among participants.

Cybersecurity incident detection efficacy: From ambidexterity and social capital perspectives.Cybersecurity experts have largely agreed that cyber breaches are inevitable for any organizations and that strategy to detect and containing intrusions as quickly as possible is thus highly important. Consequently, intrusion detection efficacy has become an especially important issue for organization cybersecurity. However, although research and innovation on intrusions detection technologies have continued to advance to tackle this issue, not enough attention and support have been given to the human aspect of intrusions detection. To address this gap, this research aims to study team capabilities necessary to more accurately and speedily detect intrusions in organization information systems. In particular, this research applies ambidexterity - a form of dynamic capability - to explore and examine the importance of cybersecurity task force's ambidexterity in enhancing intrusions detection efficacy. This research also explores and examines the social supports and social resources cybersecurity task force needs to enhance their ambidexterity from a social capital perspective. Cybersecurity.

Behavior modeling for cybersecurity.A significant percentage of cyber security incidents can be prevented by changing human behaviors. The humans in the loop include the system administrators, software developers, end users and the personnel responsible for securing the system. Each of these group of people work in a given context and are affected by both soft factors such as management influences and workload and more tangible factors in the real world such as errors in procedures and scanning devices, faulty code or the usability of the systems they work with.

Automated generation of FMEAs using SysML for reliability, safety, and cybersecurity.In this paper, an automated FMEA generation capability using the SysML modeling language and described its application to a simple SCADA computer network was described. The outputs produced by the tool (implemented as a SysML plug-in) from this analysis were presented, and the resultant insights into the design were described. The fundamental innovation in our approach is the identification and enumeration of all failure propagation paths and the detailed documentation of the failure transformations, detection measures, mitigation measures and protective measures that can be applied to these devices to prevent or mitigate the impact of the anomaly. By doing so, we can expand the traditional FMEA approach to analysis of cyberattack vectors. Because our approach is automated and can be readily integrated into a system development effort using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), the analysis can be readily repeated throughout the design and can be used frequently to assess a system design, identify weaknesses, and take corrective actions to create a more resilient and robust system.

Return on cybersecurity investment in operational technology systems: Quantifying the value that cybersecurity technologies provide after integration.Appropriate cybersecurity investment is a challenge faced by both private and public organizations. This challenge includes understanding the actual vulnerabilities of an organization's networked systems, as well as the cost of a successful cyber attack on those systems. On top of this, an organization's cybersecurity acquisition workforce must be able to discern reality from the marketing hype that is produced by cybersecurity sales forces. This paper builds upon earlier work which developed a cybersecurity acquisition decision support mechanism (Romero-Mariona. et al., 2016). In particular, cybersecurity technology evaluation results are extended to assist organizations to define a Return on Cybersecurity Investment. This new capability is instantiated within the context of networked critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. Acquisition. Cybersecurity Investment. Decision Support.

Cyber-Security of Neural Networks in Medical Devices.European and national initiatives, as well as changes in the standards, have led to a dramatic increase in the demand for interconnected medical devices during the last few years. In addition to the increased connectivity of devices in a larger network, economic reasons demand for AI (artificial intelligence) enhanced support functions even in the medical devices domain. Both connectivity and the usage of AI in safety-relevant devices are the basis for new and additional challenges for the manufacturers. The more devices become networked, the more they become targets of cyber-attacks. This means that safety of medical devices can no longer be guaranteed without adequate cyber-security measures. These cyber-security measures must cover the whole design of the devices including their internal neural networks to ensure that the inferences are free from influences from attackers. Modern, advanced attack vectors demand for very advanced countermeasures to ensure or even increase cyber-security of medical devices in this environment. This industrial experience paper will show the required concert of measures that is accompanied by a security informed safety analysis from the earliest steps of development to increase general safety and security in the design of a modern intensive care ventilator.

A Systematic Review of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques for Cyber Security.The use of technologies, procedures, and practices, designed to protect networks, programs, and data from attacks, damages, or unauthorized access, are called cyber security. Research community has applied different methods in the area of detection of cyber security attacks. However, literature lacks a systematic literature review (SLR) to summarize the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods, specifically the use of classifiers, in the detection of cyber security attacks. To cover the vacuum, this paper presents a systematic literature review of existing classification algorithms, applied to the area of detection of cyber security attacks. Relevant literature, qualifying specialized search criteria, is retrieved and extracted from the online libraries of Science Direct and Google Scholar. Total 63 research articles were found in these libraries, which are further filtered and refined to 21 articles. These 21 articles are critically reviewed and the following information are extracted: method used, classifier used, problem solved and domain selected. From the extracted information, a detailed taxonomy is prepared and presented to help beginners in the area to understand the problem. As a result of meta-level analysis, it is concluded that Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are the most frequently used classifiers in the area of detection of cyber security.

Assessing Risk Estimations for Cyber-Security Using Expert Judgment.In this paper, we show a use-case of structured expert judgment to assess the risk of a cyber-security attack. We showcase the process of elicitating unknown and uncertain values using multiple experts and combining these judgments by weighing the experts based on their performance. The performance of an expert is assessed using the information and calibration score calculated from the judgments of calibration questions. The judgments are stated with three-points estimates of minimum, most likely, and maximum value, which serve as input for the PERT probability distribution. For the use-case, the input values frequency, vulnerability, and impact were asked. The combined results are propagated along an attack path to calculate the risk of a cyber-security attack. This was done using RISKEE, a tool for assessing risk in cyber-security and implementing the combination of expert judgments and propagation of the values in an attack-tree. It uses an attack graph to model the attack paths and applies probability distributions for the input values to consider the uncertainty of predictions and expert judgments. We also describe experiences and lessons-learned for conducting an expert elicitation to acquire input values for estimating risks in cyber-security. Cyber-security. Expert elicitation.

Theoretical Domains Framework Applied to Cybersecurity Behaviour.The challenge of changing user cybersecurity behaviour is now in the foreground of cybersecurity research. To understand the problem, cybersecurity behaviour researchers have included, into their studies, theories from the Psychology domain. Psychology makes use of several behavioural theories to explain behaviour. This leads to the question, which of these theories are best suited to firstly understand cybersecurity behaviour and secondly to change the behaviour for the better. To answer this question, as a prelude to the current paper, previous publications have 1) established a definition for the different categories of cybersecurity behaviour, 2) identified and applied a framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework, that ties different behavioural theories together into one behaviour change framework. The current study is aimed to show the link between the behavioural constructs discussed in the Theoretical Domains Framework to the different cybersecurity behaviour categories. The contribution of the study is towards the implementors of initiatives that aim to change cybersecurity behaviour. Constructs. Cybersecurity behaviour. Theoretical Domains Framework 
Automotive Cybersecurity Engineering Job Roles and Best Practices – Developed for the EU Blueprint Project DRIVES.Vehicle functions are 90% controlled by electronic and software thus, modern vehicles need to comply with cybersecurity standards and data security law. Under the EU Blueprint for Automotive - DRIVES project (www.project-drives.eu), key skills and job roles for future Automotive development are designed. These also include cybersecurity management, cybersecurity engineering, and cybersecurity testing. The working party SOQRATES (www.soqrates.de) agreed to develop the pattern of such skills set in cooperation with DRIVES. Also, to share required best practices and skills to be transferred to allow implementing the norms. This paper provides an overview of the current version of the skills set, and an example of what type of best practice is shared. Best practices. Cybersecurity. DRIVES. Skills set 
Incorporating psychology into cyber security education: A pedagogical approach.The role of the human in cyber security is well acknowledged. Many cyber security incidents rely upon targets performing specific behavioural actions, such as opening a link within a phishing email. Cyber adversaries themselves are driven by psychological processes such as motivation, group dynamics and social identity. Furthermore, both intentional and unintentional insider threats are associated with a range of psychological factors, including cognitive load, mental wellbeing, trust and interpersonal relations. By incorporating psychology into cyber security education, practitioners will be better equipped with the skills they need to address cyber security issues. However, there are challenges in doing so. Psychology is a broad discipline, and many theories, approaches and methods may have little practical significance to cyber security. There is a need to sift through the literature to identify what can be applied to cyber security. There are also pedagogical differences in how psychology and cyber security are taught and also psychological differences in the types of student that may typically study psychology and cyber security. To engage with cyber security students, it is important that these differences are identified and positively addressed. Essential to this endeavor is the need to discuss and collaborate across the two disciplines. In this paper, we explore these issues and discuss our experiences as psychology and cyber security academics who work across disciplines to deliver psychology education to cyber security students, practitioners and commercial clients.
Training young cybersecurity talents – the case of estonia. The harsh reality of the online world today is that the survival of companies - and even countries - depends on the availability of adequate cybersecurity talent pool. Different countries run programs like CyberPatriot or the European Cyber Security Challenge to spark overall interest towards cybersecurity, but also to find those suitable for a cybersecurity career and start building it from an early age. Despite this, lack of qualified cybersecurity personnel is a growing problem as many educational facilities regard cybersecurity as a ‘second-tier’ field and keep targeting those who already come from IT background. As seen from Estonian experience, even if there is a growing trend of introducing robotics and programming at schools this is not sufficient. This paper describes the Estonian experience with the CyberOlympics/CyberSpike program from 2017–2019 and reflects on the lessons learned about talent building in cybersecurity. The data was collected using mixed methods, using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. it includes results from the competition, self-evaluation, external evaluation, discussion, and personal stories. The findings show the importance of building up security culture, the substantial impact from bad/good neighborhoods and role models as well as the importance of training (with a special notion on gamification), chances to test one’s skills and also safely report bugs and security holes in online services. In addition, the results show that at the Capture the Flag (CTF) type of competitions, the younger age group outpaced their older peers, regardless of the latter having the advantages of the university and/or work experience.

A semi-formal approach towards likelihood evaluation in cybersecurity risk assessment.Likelihood assessment is the most controversial and often largely subjective part of cybersecurity risk assessment. This is also acknowledged by standardization organizations such as ISO/IEC or NIST. In particular, for highly regulated industries and critical industries this is a major problem, as often worst case estimates have to be taken for subjective parameters such as the motivation of the attacker. It has already been shown that a quantitative probabilistic approach is not feasible. However, a semi-quantitative approach like in railway safety risk analysis e.g. DIN V 0831-103, may be possible but it should have a rigorous basis and should avoid subjectivity as far as reasonably possible. In order to achieve this, a semi-formal approach is pursued in this paper. In a first step the requirements for such an approach are formalized as far as possible. A similar approach has already been practiced in functional safety by DIN V 0831-101. In a second step a candidate method is constructed and evaluated against the requirements. The approach is based on the well-known Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), but it is not applied retrospectively but proactively. For this purpose, the CVSS model has to be extended and adapted to match the requirements. The advantage of this approach is that it is similar to a de facto industry standard in vulnerability scoring, which is proven in use. The result of this paper is a new thoroughly engineered method for likelihood evaluation in cybersecurity risk assessment. It is compared to similar approaches. CVSS. Cybersecurity. Likelihood.

Bayesian network based analysis of cyber security impact on safety.Cyber security gains further importance regarding life cycle risk analysis of technical systems, e.g. Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) or Systems of Systems (SoS) in the context of increasing dependency on networked systems and processes in domains like industry 4.0 or smart home. At the same time, the operation of networked systems in environments critical to safety poses the challenge of analyzing a growing number of potential interactions between safety and security aspects. In industrial environments, the assessment of functional safety is a standard procedure, e.g. using IEC 61508 and domain-specific derivatives, while cyber security in safety relevant domains has only been introduced in the last few years. The assessment of cyber security is a rapidly developing discipline, but until now there have been only few approaches to merge the standardized procedures in safety and security. This paper presents an approach based on Bayesian Networks (BN) that enables to consider the impact of cyber security threats on functional safety considerations. By means of a simplified x-by-wire system, safety and security relations as well as structures are derived and an integrated safety and security BN is established. It is shown that parameter learning in BN can be used to adapt chosen target parameters to a required integrated safety and security level. Thus, it is possible to enhance the system configuration considering new cyber security threats. Bayesian Networks. Cyber Attacks. Cyber Security. Functional Safety. Machine Learning.

The concept of cybersecurity culture. Due to a growing understanding that cybersecurity needs to be addressed also through organizational measures and not by technical measures alone, cybersecurity culture is attracting increasing attention. In this paper, we present findings from a narrative literature review of 69 papers with the purpose to identify the dimensions of cybersecurity culture and how these may be targeted by the organization. The results show that cybersecurity culture is understood as a sub-component of organizational culture comprised of layers that are increasingly more observable. Further, key practices for developing cybersecurity culture resemble those highlighted in the literature on safety culture: management support. policy. awareness and training. involvement and communication. and learning from experience. We conclude with a brief discussion of whether cybersecurity culture and safety culture are two distinct sub-components of organizational culture or can be understood to be overlapping. Copyright .

A game theoretic model for understanding and modelling cybersecurity for telecommunications operators.Cybersecurity is typically characterised as being between defenders and attackers. The economic analysis of such situations is made using either simple normal form games or Stackelberg game or dynamic games. We draw upon experiences in the telecommunications operator and standardisation domain in this study. While this model suffices for the understanding of the basic concepts, it does not and can not capture many of the subtle realities of the cybersecurity environment. Indeed it can result in a misunderstanding of the nature of threats when the defender is not under active attack. We construct a model consisting of more roles and introduce the notion of an explicit security concept with a value to each of the participants or roles. Using this model we can explore the individual sub-games between participants and roles through dynamic games with imperfect information. In the former, we can understand the internal dynamics for any given security control, while in the latter we obtain a larger overall understanding of the players and their actions. Two results that are of particular interest in the studied domain are where the distinction between 'foes' and'allies' is lost and where the absence of an attack cannot be understood as the absence of an attack.

Cyber security of urban guided transport management according to MILS principles.The Urban guided transport management system (UGTMS) as subway, transports from several hundreds of thousands to millions of passengers per day. Size and irreplaceability of subway transport capacity include the subway transport to the critical infrastructures of cities, regions or countries. Modern transport critical infrastructures contain in addition to physical and social parts also the cyber control systems and they are marked as cyber- physical systems (CPS). The CPSs are characterized by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. The CPS complexity, openness and dynamics form a large attack surface that may lead to failures and irreparable damage. Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) can meet the high system security requirements. The MILS is a high-assurance security architecture based on the concepts of separation and controlled information flow. The article discusses the possibilities of using the MILS platform in the data communication subsystem, which connects the individual UGTMS subsystems (Wayside subsystem, On-board subsystem and operation control subsystem). Therefore, the communication system should guarantee transmission parameters and do not affect security level of the respective subsystems. Critical infrastructures. Cyber physical systems.

Establishing a cybersecurity centre for industrial control systems. Studying cyber-attacks through cybersecurity exercises, testing and training is difficult to perform on operational critical infrastructure as this could disrupt the critical systems and harm the environment, lives and economy. Therefore, cybersecurity testbeds or ranges with capabilities for simulation, emulation and/or using real components are widely used to understand cyber-attacks and their impact on systems. This paper presents the Cybersecurity Centre being developed at the Institute for Energy Technology in Norway. The Centre aims to provide facilities for providing cybersecurity assessment and training services to stakeholders involved in developing and operating critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technologies (OT). The Centre, among others, has: a highly configurable platform with real, simulated and emulated components of real-world critical infrastructure. tools for vulnerability assessment, RAMS (reliability, availability, maintainability, safety) assessment, attack injection, incident monitoring, detection and response. high-fidelity simulation technologies for cybersecurity and RAMS events prediction. support evaluation of human preparedness and decision-making during cybersecurity incident process and for operational safety.

20 years of scientific evolution of cyber security: A science mapping.The technologies of industry 4.0 such as big data brings challenges since companies will have to deal with a large amount of data that will help to anticipate and solve problems in development, flexibility and organizational efficiency. On the other hand, companies need to create defenses strategies, also known as cyber security in order to deal with the cyber-attacks. The objective of this study is to perform a science mapping in the field of study of cyber security in order to discover current topics, authors in the field and create a map of the area of study, identify productive themes with great scientific impact and point challenges, perspectives and suggestion for future works. To perform this science mapping, the SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool) was used. Besides, the VOSviewer was used to analyze co-authorship between countries and authors. The scientific evolution presented 17 clusters whereby the most representative themes are: 'challenges', 'framework' and 'intrusion detection'. The analysis of the network of the cluster 'challenges' showed the most challenges that researchers are trying to solve such as: 'privacy', 'smart grid', 'internet of thing', 'systems', 'smart cities', and 'cloud computing'.

Variable self-efficacy as a measurement for behaviors in cyber security operations.Training and development of skills gives individuals the knowledge and procedures required to perform their tasks. Training also requires individuals to develop reflective skills that help consolidate and transfer knowledge to long-term memory, where it then can be recalled in appropriate situations. But to develop reflective skills, one must first engage with the task’s demands and then analyse how one’s skills were appropriate or not for the situational demands, and how one could have also approached the situation differently. This process leads to an adaptable self-efficacy. It is still unclear how personality trait measures of self-efficacy can predict performance in cyber security operations. We developed an adaptable self-efficacy measure which was collected via an app. Findings support previous research that specific self-efficacy has better predictive validity, but also finds that an increased number of measurements could yield better effect sizes. This research shows how multiple measurements of specific self-efficacy can be done with minimized invasiveness while providing better measurement reliability and predictability. General findings and implications for further research are also discussed. Assessment. Cyber security. Self-efficacy 
Data mining methodology in support of a systematic review of human aspects of cybersecurity.Cybersecurity is an evolving field in the area of human-computer interactions (HCI), but human factors is a relevant area to consider when approaching cybersecurity. This report illustrates the findings of a systematic literature review of current publications on the emerging trends of human factors in cybersecurity. Analyses of content and bibliometrics were accomplished by using tools such as VOS Viewer, MAXQDA, Harzing, and AuthorMapper to establish the findings of emerging trends in the field. This report includes a step-by-step procedure for conducting the content analyses in each tool. The areas of human factors and cybersecurity are examined based on the data of the content analyses. A key finding is that human factors theory emerged from content analysis, and can be a basis for future research. Bibliometric analysis. Cybersecurity. Human factors 
Improving the Training Materials of Information Security Based on Cybersecurity Framework.The shortage of human resources related to information security has been a problem in Japan since the last decade. To encourage self-learning, we created training materials revised based on the guidelines of information security published by the Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan. The materials were partly designed using a text-mining analysis based on the framework core of the cybersecurity framework published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In this extended abstract, we consider the accuracy of the text-mining approach and a rough design of the materials. Cybersecurity Framework. Self-learning. Text-mining. tf-idf 
Examining human individual differences in cyber security and possible implications for human-machine interface design.With society now heavily invested in cyber-technology and most cyber-attacks due to human error, it has never been more vital to focus research on human-centric interventions. Whilst some studies have previously investigated the importance of end-user individual differences (gender, age, education, risk-taking preferences, decision-making style, personality and impulsivity) the current study extended the research to also include acceptance of the internet and the constructs used to explain behavior within the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). Seventy-one participants completed a battery of questionnaires on personality, risk-taking preferences, decision-making style, personality, impulsivity, acceptance of the internet, the combined PMT and TPB questionnaire, as well as an online cyber-security behaviors questionnaire. Gender, age and education did not relate to any cyber-security behaviors, however a number of individual differences were associated. These behaviors include financial risk-taking, avoidant decision-making plus ease of use, facilitating conditions, and trust in the internet. It was also found that safer cyber-security behaviors are seen in those who appraise threat as high, perceive themselves to have the required skills to protect themselves, see value in this protection and understand their place in the cyber-security chain. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding how individual differences relate to cyber-security behaviors in order to create more tailored human-centric interventions such as computer-based decision support systems and other human-machine interface solutions.

trust me, you will need it: Cybersecurity as extracurricular subject at estonian schools.Discovering new talents in IT and cybersecurity is increasingly vital in the information society. The traditional approach has been to start professional profiling when the youth reach grade 10 (age 16–17) – many young people find a topic to focus on in the secondary school and finally form a profession with the 3rd-level studies (trade school or university). Yet, this may be an outdated way, as the leaders of tomorrow will need competencies in more than one field, cyber skills being likely one of them. The initial results of the Estonian best-practice: Competition CyberCracker School round for 7–12th graders suggests that the method works in several aspects. First, the number of talented youth is quite large in comparison with population numbers - the mass screening in the first rounds allows find also those who would not enter any competitions (for various reasons). Second, while the gender gap still exists (interviews with the participants reveal that the number of girls seeing themselves as future cybersecurity specialists is still small compared to boys), the 2/2 quota does not reflect ‘equality on paper only’ - the actual enthusiasm does not differ (once the latter have actually reached the final round). Overall, the positive trend is clearly visible - just in a year (2018/2019), the number of participants went up from 1000 to 2344 and the number of participating schools from 47 to 65. Competition.

Mental model mapping method for cybersecurity.Visualizations can enhance the efficiency of Cyber Defense Analysts, Cyber Defense Incident Responders and Network Operations Specialists (Subject Matter Experts, SME) by providing contextual information for various cybersecurity-related datasets and data sources. We propose that customized, stereoscopic 3D visualizations, aligned with SMEs internalized representations of their data, may enhance their capability to understand the state of their systems in ways that flat displays with either text, 2D or 3D visualizations cannot afford. For these visualizations to be useful and efficient, we need to align these to SMEs internalized understanding of their data. In this paper we propose a method for interviewing SMEs to extract their implicit and explicit understanding of the data that they work with, to create useful, interactive, stereoscopically perceivable visualizations that would assist them with their tasks.

The impact of gamification factor in the acceptance of cybersecurity awareness augmented reality game (cybar).Human behavior is considered to be the weakest link in the field of cybersecurity. Despite the development of a wide range of Augmented Reality (AR) applications in various domains, no AR application is available to educate users and increase their awareness of cybersecurity issues. Thus, we developed a game based on AR techniques as an Android app called CybAR. Since there have been few acceptance studies in the field of AR, it was particularly important to identify the factors that affect user acceptance of AR technology. This paper aims to identify whether gamification features influence users’ acceptance of the CybAR app and increase their cybersecurity awareness. The predictors of CybAR app usage were derived from the extended unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT2) with the addition of the gamification factor. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a study addressing the impact of gamification features on acceptance of the CybAR game. The theoretical model was tested in a quantitative study using structural equation modelling, conducted in Australia, with 95 Macquarie University students. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between gamification factors and behavioural intention to use the CybAR app and actual use of the CybAR app. Behavioural analysis.

Games for cybersecurity decision-making.Decision-makers are often confronted with cybersecurity challenges, which they may not fully comprehend but nonetheless need to critically address. Efficient preparation through cybersecurity games has become an invaluable tool to better prepare strategy and response to cyber incidents. Such games offer the potential for capacity building of decision-makers through a controlled environment, often presenting hypothetical scenarios that are designed to invoke discussion, while decision-making skills are put to the test. While games are acknowledged to be an effective method for such situations, many rely on technical capabilities to address these challenges. However, a key challenge is to understand the factors that influence cybersecurity decision-making. Further, game effectiveness for developing these skills is often not validated. This paper surveys cybersecurity games and compiles a data-set of 46 games to investigate how effective cybersecurity games are for assessing decision-making skills, and determines the state-of-the-art game. Through critical review and analysis of the data-set, a criteria to assess games for decision-making skills is presented. Furthermore, the criteria is applied to ten games, which determined Cyber 9/12 to be the state-of-the-art cybersecurity game for decision-making. The paper concludes with insights into how the assessment criteria can support the development of better decision-making skills through games. Capacity-building. Cybersecurity games. Decision-making.

Does decision-making style predict individuals’ cybersecurity avoidance behaviour?.In the field of cybersecurity, human behaviour is considered as the weakest link. We applied gamification techniques to the development of an Augmented Reality game, CybAR, which was designed to educate users about cybersecurity in an effective and entertaining way. This research incorporates decision-making style into Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT) of CybAR game use. This paper particularly focuses on the role of decision-making style in avoidance of risky cybersecurity behaviour based on factors derived from Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT). A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 95 students at Macquarie University to assess the effect of individual differences, namely, decision-making style, as a moderator variable between motivation behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour factors. The findings indicated that the moderating effect of decision-making style had a significant effect on avoidance behaviour. In particular, rational decision-making was a strongly significant moderator of avoidance behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour, while dependent and avoidant styles were less significant moderators of avoidance behaviour and cybersecurity avoidance behaviour.

A new hope: Human-centric cybersecurity research embedded within organizations. Humans are and have been the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain (e.g., [1–3]). Not all systems are adequately protected and even for those that are, individuals can still fall prey to cyber-attack attempts (e.g., phishing, malware, ransomware) that occasionally break through, and/or engage in other cyber risky behaviors (e.g., not adequately securing devices) that put even the most secure systems at risk. Such susceptibility can be due to one or a number of factors, including individual differences, environmental factors, maladaptive behaviors, and influence techniques. This is particularly concerning at an organizational level where the costs of a successful cyber-attack can be colossal (e.g., financial, safety, reputational). Cyber criminals’ intent on infiltrating organization accounts/networks to inflict damage, steal data, and/or make financial gains will continue to try and exploit these human vulnerabilities unless we are able to act fast and do something about them. Is there any hope for human resistance? We argue that technological solutions alone rooted in software and hardware will not win this battle. The ‘human’ element of any digital system is as important to its enduring security posture. More research is needed to better understand human cybersecurity vulnerabilities within organizations. This will inform the development of methods (including those rooted in HCI) to decrease cyber risky and enhance cyber safe decisions and behaviors: to fight back, showing how humans, with the right support, can be the best line of cybersecurity defense. In this paper, we assert that in order to achieve the highest positive impactful benefits from such research efforts, more human-centric cybersecurity research needs to be conducted with expert teams embedded within industrial organizations driving forward the research. This cannot be an issue addressed through laboratory-based research alone. Industrial organizations need to move towards more holistic – human- and systems- centric – cybersecurity research and solutions that will create safer and more secure employees and organizations. working in harmony to better defend against cyber-attack attempts. One such example is the Airbus Accelerator in Human-Centric Cyber Security (H2CS), which is discussed as a case study example within the current paper. Cyber psychology. Cybersecurity.

Analyzing cybersecurity understanding using a brain computer interface.Widespread internet device use is simultaneously increasing individual cybersecurity risk. Individual awareness of cybersecurity risk must begin early, in high school and with a curriculum that engages the student’s interest in a highly technical topic. The research project presented here explores the best way to teach cybersecurity to high school students to accomplish these goals. Researchers developed and delivered cybersecurity lectures to the students weekly, observing that each lecture and activity caused a different reaction and interest level depending on the way the topic was approached. Results from this research show the best way to engage students in cybersecurity education topics, as measured by assessment using a brain computer interface (BCI). A curriculum with eight topics was prepared, with selected subjects providing an entry point for different learning styles. Active learning activities and student outcomes show the validity of this approach, as do pre- and post-survey assessments. The results from this work can be used to further develop appropriate engaging cybersecurity education, while reducing student stress. Brain computer interface. Cybersecurity.

Sleeping with the enemy: Does depletion cause fatigue with cybersecurity?.Cybersecurity training and awareness programs can act to exacerbate rather than improve the cybersecurity threat posed by naïve and non-malicious actions of employees [1, 2]. Employees report being unable to keep up with cybersecurity demands while also managing their core workload [1]. Cyber Fatigue is a weariness, aversion, or lack of motivation regarding cybersecurity [3]. It manifests due to overexposure to cybersecurity and a lack of available cognitive or workplace resources to cope with its demands. The current study examined the effect of non-attitudinal fatigue, which results from repetitive cybersecurity actions, on password-creation behaviour. Data collection involved an online experimental task and a set of standardised and adapted psychometric measures. Based on previous research [4, 5], cyber fatigue was induced in the two experimental conditions using a CAPTCHA task. The study was completed by 187 (97 male, 90 female) employed adult participants. However, we found no significant relationship between depletion and password creation behaviours. Our findings have important practical implications for interventions and provides insight for training aimed at improving employee behaviour. Cyber fatigue. Cybersecurity. Employee behaviour.

A Review of Cyber Security Issues in Hospitality Industry.The purpose of this study is to emphasize the importance of cyber security in hospitality industry. This study further identifies and analyzes several common network threats and recommends useful security practices and techniques to prevent cyber attacks in hotels. This study is a rich source of information for Information Technology (IT) directors and Chief Information Officers (CIO) to advance their policies and procedures for security of electronic information in hotels using the most recent and updated information available in the area of hospitality industry. The methodology of this study is a unique combination of qualitative method and review method for an in-depth understanding of real-life issues within the industry and the most recent technical and practical solutions that hotels use to handle and solve these issues. The findings of this study show that the techniques currently utilized by hotels to prevent cyber attacks are mostly rudimentary and outdated. Furthermore, study indicates that most of the hotel staff lacks the knowledge and expertise to handle potential threats and thus hospitality industry becomes even more vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks. Finally, the paper discusses some implications and recommendations to hotel’s policy makers to help secure the hotels’ and guests’ information from security attacks. Cyber security.

Economic Prospect Theory Applied to Cybersecurity.A growing concern in the cybersecurity community evaluation of the strengths and defenses regarding cyberattacks. One approach that has not been often explored is to estimate the strength of an attack or defense in economic terms. For example, estimation of the memory required for code used for an attack, or what is equivalent, the computer time to execute an attack. We choose to express the costs in economic terms, and thus define the method of analyzing an important line of research known as behavioral economics, pioneered by Kahneman and Tversky, and translated into cybersecurity terms. In this way we attempt to determine a cybersecurity analog for well-known results in economic prospect theory to be able to estimate the costs of cyberattacks and defenses. Cyberattacker.

Developing Digital Awareness at School: A Fundamental Step for Cybersecurity Education.The theme of cybersecurity regards people in primis, considering that everyone uses digital technologies both in professional and private life, and that people’s behaviour plays an important role in the occurrence of cyberthreats. The human factor has therefore to be recognized as an essential element to be considered for developing an effective cybersecurity, and education is the key driver. However, since children access online activities at an early age, it is wise to develop interventions to promote digital awareness from first years at school, focusing on the responsible use of digital technologies. Becoming conscious of the risks they are exposed to is an important step for children to move safely on the Internet and to understand the different cyber-risks they have to face. This activity represents hence a fundamental step for cybersecurity education. In this paper we present a study investigating Italian school teachers’ perception of their students’ digital awareness and their evaluation of the actions needed for its development. Answers were provided by 2,229 teachers from all over the country belonging to primary and secondary schools, participating in a national project whose goal is to spread computer science and to sensitize students to a proper use of digital technologies. The results confirm the high sensitivity of teachers towards digital awareness issues. Indeed, students should be prepared to recognize risks when they use digital technologies: not only cyberbullying, they should pay more attention to the protection of their personal data, and to the reliability of news on social media. Moreover, teachers declare the need for themselves to receive specific training on digital awareness, and to be supported in their activities. Cybersecurity. Digital awareness. Education 
Guidelines and Tool Support for Building a Cybersecurity Awareness Program for SMEs.Nowadays companies have become highly dependent on digital technology for running their business, regardless their size or domain. Smaller organisations require a specific attention because of their lower level of protection, capability of reaction and recovery while they are increasingly being targeted by cyberattacks. In order to improve their level of cybersecurity and resilience, a first step is to raise awareness. It is however not an easy task because it is highly dependent on human factors, spread across the whole organisation, including managers, business users and IT staff. This paper aims at supporting the development of a cybersecurity awareness program for small and medium enterprises. In order to build the program on strong foundations, the current state of awareness of such companies is presented and a SWOT analysis carried out. Different instruments for efficiently supporting the deployment of the program are then presented. A practical experience carried out in Belgium to implement some of the proposed instruments is also presented and some lessons learned are discussed. Assessment. Awareness. Cybersecurity. Quiz. SME.

Risk based approach in scope of cybersecurity threats and requirements.Paper is focused on theoretical and practical considerations related to risk management and cyber security based on the cyber kill chain concept introduced by Lockheed Martin. Proposed approach of cyber risk management embedded on the cyber kill chain is new and not reflected in the available literature. Proposed risk management process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, assessing and ultimately responding to cyber threats and monitoring risks in each stage of the cyber kill chain is the heart of proposed approach. The approach may be used in organizations which are going to implement security mechanisms to align with the in-force requirements or to reduce cyber risks to accepted level. The process of the risk assessment introduced by the authors follows with the description of the example risk evaluation method based on a continuous-time Markov chain as a model of the cyber kill chain.

Cybersecurity impact of the growth of data in sports. As the sporting industry continues to increase dependence on new and often massive data sets, they also risk exposing themselves, as well as the leagues, teams, venues, players, and fans, to risks posed by not protecting the confidentiality and integrity of this data. The industry, especially true for professional sports, demands an ever increasing supply of new forms of data to achieve their goals of enticing new fans. enhancing experience. expanding the fan experience from venues and television to the internet and mobile devices. measuring and evaluating the performance and safety of players. and increasing revenue. New methods have emerged to collect data about a variety of aspects of sports ranging from players to fans to teams to venues. Data collected during sporting events is combined with historical data to also help teams analyze and predict performance. To synthesize these predictive analytical and historical memories, sports teams and organizations mix a variety of computer technologies. System integration tends to focus on ensuring the availability of the data and reliability of the technologies but might introduce risks to the confidentiality (privacy) and integrity of the data. Recognizing the potential risks requires review and evaluation. Much of the data is collected for publicly providing information to the fans, so threats to confidentiality pose fewer risks. The greatest risk is violating the privacy of players, such a private performance test, or using technology to gain a competitive advantage.
Deep analytics for management and cybersecurity of the national energy grid.The United States’s energy grid could fall into victim to numerous cyber attacks resulting in unprecedented damage to national security. The smart concept devices including electric automobiles, smart homes and cities, and the Internet of Things (IoT) promise further integration but as the hardware, software, and network infrastructure becomes more integrated they also become more susceptible to cyber attacks or exploitation. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)’s Big Data Platform (BDP), deep analytics, and unsupervised machine learning (ML) have the potential to address resource management, cybersecurity, and energy network situation awareness. In this paper, we demonstrate their potential using the Pecan Street data. We also show an unsupervised ML such as lexical link analysis (LLA) as a causal learning tool to discover the causes for anomalous behavior related to energy use and cybersecurity. Anomaly detection.

On the impact of network data balancing in cybersecurity applications.Machine learning methods are now widely used to detect a wide range of cyberattacks. Nevertheless, the commonly used algorithms come with challenges of their own - one of them lies in network dataset characteristics. The dataset should be well-balanced in terms of the number of malicious data samples vs. benign traffic samples to achieve adequate results. When the data is not balanced, numerous machine learning approaches show a tendency to classify minority class samples as majority class samples. Since usually in network traffic data there are significantly fewer malicious samples than benign samples, in this work the problem of learning from imbalanced network traffic data in the cybersecurity domain is addressed. A number of balancing approaches is evaluated along with their impact on different machine learning algorithms. Classifiers. Cybersecurity. Data imbalance. Machine learning 
Toward sustainable behaviour change: An approach for cyber security education training and awareness.Effective information security education, training and awareness (SETA) is essential for protecting organisational information resources. Whilst most organisations invest significantly in implementing SETA programs, the number of incidents resulting from employee noncompliance with security policy are increasing. This trend may indicate that many current SETA programs are not as effective as they should be. We argue that existing SETA programs are not optimal in changing employee behaviour to comply with security policy as they lack a theoretical base that can inform and guide the development of SETA programs. This study draws on knowledge from the medical domain on the use of theory to design an intervention to bring about sustainable behaviour change. The paper therefore adopts an intervention design process, based on the behaviour change wheel (BCW) framework, to develop a theory-informed SETA development process. The paper demonstrates the use of BCW in the analysis of the target behaviour and the selection of suitable strategies and techniques to change the target behaviour. The proposed SETA development process provides a sound basis for future empirical work including focus groups and action research. Behaviour Change Wheel. Behavioural Information Security.

Towards a cybersecurity culture tool through a holistic, multi-dimensional assessment framework.Cyber-security culture forms one of the best lines of defence against many cyber-attacks making it an ideal and efficient target to address, in order to better secure organisations. It has its foundations on the information security policies and procedures enforced by its management. It is also dictated and formed by the behaviour, perceptions and attitudes of its employees. These will form the basis of our model which aims to quantify these theoretical constructs in order to analyse them and provide feedback. The close examination of existing security assessment tools and frameworks while identifying the most important security components and sections which need to be addressed and evaluated, resulted in our proposition of a state-of-the-art cyber-security culture tool. The presented approach aims to address existing gaps by adopting a holistic perspective that incorporates both organisational and individual aspects of security culture, including behavioural traits that affect and risk the security level of the company. Our approach and tool will be applied to the EPES sector, where the timely assessment of the security culture is considered essential and of high impact. Assessment. Awareness. Cybersecurity Culture.

Method of cybersecurity level determining for the critical information infrastructure of the state.Protection of the state's critical information infrastructure is a complex process, which requires effective tools for entities' identification, assessing their criticality, threat and vulnerability assessment, protection against threats and also determining the cybersecurity level of the individual entities, industries, regions, and countries. The conducted analysis is shown that today there is no complex, multifunctional method which helps to evaluate the cybersecurity level of the critical information infrastructure entity or a certain industry of the state. With that in mind, in this paper the method of determining the cybersecurity level of the state's critical information infrastructure was developed, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of the known approaches. The method will be useful for CSIRT groups (or any other parties, who is responsible for cybersecurity in organization) to analyze a particular industry and evaluate its cybersecurity level. The developed method allows to calculate quantitative parameters, describing the analyzed sector, also to compare the security level of the critical entity before and after implementation of certain security measures. For example, the usage of the mentioned method in the civil aviation was shown but it can be used in various critical infrastructure sectors. Copyright . Civil aviation.

Using fuzzy cognitive map approach for assessing cybersecurity for telehealth scenario.Health organizations are investing in the development of telehealth systems to expand advances in health care to the homes of the Brazilian population. The adoption of telehealth aims to broaden basic monitoring and promote access to health services. Telehealth systems present a confidential data set containing patient health history, medication prescriptions, and medical diagnostics. However, in Brazil, there are no cybersecurity studies to address factors that impact patient manipulation and data transfer. Understanding cybersecurity impacts is critical for telehealth development strategies. The research reported here used several factors related to cyberattacks and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, combined with the approach to Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), to identify the links between these elements. An evaluation using FCMs has proven to be able to describe the complexity of the system by providing an appropriate visual tool for staff to develop planning. The experimental results of the study contributed to supporting cybersecurity improvements in telehealth. Cyberattacks. Cybersecurity. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Telehealth 
Artificial intelligence presents new challenges in cybersecurity.Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) based solutions contain inherent vulnerabilities that are of growing concern as investment is made into applying these technologies to gain a strategic advantage in speed of response, analysis, and maneuver for both private industry and government applications. Current cybersecurity practices and tools must evolve to handle new vulnerabilities inherent to AI/ML enabled systems across all domains. This paper will explore how the tools and techniques to defend against attacks and exploits, both on AI/ML, and with AI/ML, fall short from the tools typically used by today's cybersecurity professional. It will explore both the intrinsic vulnerabilities due to model failure points and data poisoning strategies as well as address concerns that arise when our adversaries use AI/ML tools to their advantage. Some of these challenges present themselves as very advanced strategies brought on by nation state actors who have both time and resources. Other threats to our AI/ML systems are much less sophisticated but still seem to slip through the cracks because AI/ML is only beginning to gain significant momentum in real world applications.

Cybersecurity Readiness of E-tail Organisations: A Technical Perspective.Cybersecurity readiness is a challenging issue for online retail businesses which are losing billions of dollars due to cyber-crimes and a lack of readiness to manage these. Therefore, research into cybersecurity readiness in the online retail industry is needed. Technical tools are the foremost measures of defence against these attacks. This study investigates cybersecurity readiness from the technical perspective in some UK online retailers. This research adopted a qualitative case study approach with semi-structured interviews for collecting data. A total of 15 interviews were conducted with an online retail company’s staff and management who had responsibility for managing cybersecurity. A thematic analysis method was used to analyse the qualitative data. The research findings show that the company is facing internal and external threats to their information systems and their technical defences are not very effective at present. The company should consider investing more resources in the technical controls to prevent these attacks. Cyber threats and risks. Cybersecurity. Network security. Organisational readiness.

Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent Named Entity Recognition of Cyber Security.In recent years, the amount of Cyber Security data generated in the form of unstructured texts, for example, social media resources, blogs, articles, and so on has exceptionally increased. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an initial step towards converting this unstructured data into structured data which can be used by a lot of applications. The existing methods on NER for Cyber Security data are based on rules and linguistic characteristics. A Deep Learning (DL) based approach embedded with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is proposed in this paper. Several DL architectures are evaluated to find the most optimal architecture. The combination of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and CRF performed better compared to various other DL frameworks on a publicly available benchmark dataset. This may be due to the reason that the bidirectional structures preserve the features related to the future and previous words in a sequence. Cyber Security. Deep Learning. Information extraction.

Energy Awareness and Secure Communication Protocols: The Era of Green Cybersecurity.The computational effort required to guarantee the security of a communication, due to the complexity of the cryptographic algorithms, heavily influences the energy consumption and consequently the energy demand of the involved parties. This energy request makes secure communication with low energy consumption a non-trivial issue. The aim of this work is to study, as well as evaluate, the way in which the cryptographic primitives used in secure communication protocols affect the workload of the CPU and, therefore, the energy expenditure of the interacting devices. Through the aforementioned analysis, attention will be focused on the need to consider with greater sensitivity the possibility of operating/undergoing cyber-attacks using the power consumption induced by secure communications. The main focus is to exaggerate the workload of the target devices in order to produce the maximum energy consumption and have a kind of Denial-of-Service attack. The paper studies the contribution of energy consumption introduced by the different part of secure primitives within the TLS protocol. As a conclusion, it is shown how Cryptography is often used not in the proper way, i.e., it may introduce costs that are sometimes higher than the value of the goods to protect. Applied cryptography.

Genesis of Russian cyber security legal mechanism: An authentic or a trend alike model?. The object of the research is the relationship within the improvement of the national legal mechanism for cybersecurity in the new conditions of emerging cyber threats. The features of the Russian legal mechanism for information security are being characterized, the role of the Russian Federation in the international system of information communication technologies security is determined. The autonomous Internet law and the data localization law are being reviewed and evaluated for the compliance with the international trends and information security standards. The general and the special legal methods of scientific knowledge (comparative legal and formal-legal methods) were used in the study. The elaboration of the Russian legal mechanism of cyber security has the common features with the other national mechanisms. The use of the autonomous Internet model is justified by the stated goals. possible law misuses are expected and are eliminated due to the available tools. The Russian data localization model is a natural response to cyber threats and helps to reduce the potential risks that occur within the globalization processes, and no state is insured from those risks even if its cybersecurity mechanism is considered as the best in the world (as in Singapore). The Russian legislator should consider setting similar technical requirements as the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom has made (for imported telecommunication equipment), especially in light of the 5G networks development.

A review of and agenda for cybersecurity policy models.Recently, cybersecurity has received increased attention, as the quantity and severity of breaches continues to rise. Fundamental architecture and practices research exists in the computer science and policy domains, but research is lacking from a decision sciences perspective. This research reviews three policy models for cybersecurity. These models are from a policy perspective and focus on both heuristics and metrics. The general approach of these models limits predictive and prescriptive analysis by focusing on descriptive modeling and the static nature of system design. As a way forward, we present preliminary research of value focused modeling of cybersecurity metrics. This approach enables identification of the most critical metrics and supports prescriptive analytics for design and monitoring of cybersecurity systems. Analytics. Cybersecurity. Metrics. Policy.

Modeling and simulating large scale cyber effects for cybersecurity using riverbed modeler.Organizations have moved towards service based architectures and applications are hosted in the Clouds. An interruption in online delivery of such services is of grave concern to the organizations as it causes problems to a large number of users. The identification of the security vulnerability in these systems which can be exploited by cybercriminals is of utmost importance when developing an architecture for online hosting of applications. Defensive capabilities to thwart the cybercriminals must be deployed. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is commonly employed to create panic and prevent the delivery of services to legitimate users. This paper presents the use of network security simulation and modeling for understanding the effect of cyberattacks such as DDoS on a system. Experimentations conducted include deployment of services such as FTP, Email, and HTTP in a simulated environment. The main aim is to simulate network infrastructure and security policies before online deployment of the services. As these services will be used by a large number of users concurrently, it would be important to create a resilient system against modern DDoS attacks. The observations from the simulations will allow to share and expand the knowledge of the users for development of secure systems. Cloud Computing. DDoS attack. Network Simulation. SaaS.

Cybersecurity Text Data Classification and Optimization for CTI Systems.Cyber threat intelligence systems provide a way to prioritize alerts and allow security teams to focus on critical threats and utilize their resources more efficiently. One challenge in these systems comes in accurately classifying the data that is input and processed within the system which is critical to producing meaningful output. To tackle this problem, in this paper we research text-based cybersecurity data classification methods using a multi-layer keyword filtering method and unsupervised learning methods using doc2vec. We also look at how we can optimize the accuracy and efficiency of cyber threat intelligence systems through the use of ensemble learning. This research will help with prioritization of cyber threat intelligence systems which allow security teams to use their resources more efficiently.
Notes on maritime cybersecurity in ship design.European merchant traffic through the internal and external maritime lines are a critical infrastructure within the European Union, and are likely to be attacked. In this paper, an analysis of the main control systems of a ship and the possibilities of being attacked cybernetically are delineated. Conservative hierarchy in the design of the control systems is proposed and the general conclusions of the analysis are presented. The current trend towards automation implies that many ships rely on data networks and information systems. Two very important data networks are the navigation network and the propulsion control network, which can also be interconnected with each other and, in turn, to other networks. The control systems in turn depend on the SCADA equipment that has already proven vulnerable to attacks to alter its operation. Ship design strategies that can resist or mitigate the effects of a cyber attack with reduced crews are discussed.
Comparative Analysis of Japan and the US Cybersecurity Related Newspaper Articles: A Content and Sentiment Analysis Approach.Recent advancements in the field of Information Technology (IT) have not only changed the way people consume news but also made it possible for researchers to analyze a plethora of news, especially when the headlines are changing every minute. Big data, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are becoming staple for researchers of every domain to discover patterns and themes in the vast amount of data. This research would utilize NPL and ML techniques to analyze cybersecurity-related newspaper articles of major newspapers (digital version) from Japan and the US. Japan and the US are close allies, and they are collaborating in the field of cybersecurity owing to its rising significance for nations. However, as the demography, culture, and political behavior are different in both countries, it would be fascinating and very critical to analyze how newspapers from both countries are dealing with cybersecurity issues.
Critical infrastructures cybersecurity and the maritime sector.The paper addresses cyber-security in the maritime field, a sector increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to advances that are already in the process of implementation. This paper explores the level of knowledge and training required on the subject and its interaction with marine ecosystem. For this reason, we will carry out a deep bibliographic review in which we will support our later study. We will analyze the results obtained in an online questionnaire answered by experienced maritime professionals. The results show a lack of general knowledge in the field of maritime cybersecurity. Therefore, it is necessary to increase training levels in the maritime sector and the port interface connection with the supply chain. Critical Infrastructures. Cybersecurity. Maritime Sector.

Cybersecurity and its integration with safety for transport systems: Not a formal fulfillment but an actual commitment. Vulnerabilities and hacking cases in transport systems are already documented. In the last two or three years guidelines and methods for cybersecurity in transport systems have been drafted and the importance of convergence of safety and cybersecurity has been stressed. Many companies today offer products and services for this field. There is the risk, however, that such an important matter will be considered as a formal fulfillment. In order to promote a real awareness about vulnerabilities affecting transport systems technologies, which rely mostly on embedded devices, and about the attacks that can exploit them, we use as an example a real incident involving a safety-critical subsystem of a railway vehicle (that we think of as a  cyber-physical system ) to develop a case study concerning a cyberattack, aiming to show that devices and technological systems vulnerabilities must not be neglected in risk analysis. Conversely, they must be taken into account the same way as hazards in safety assessments for an effective integration between cybersecurity and safety. Therefore we propose an attack-fault tree for the case study as an example of integrated risk analysis. attack-fault tree. cyberattacks. cybersecurity standards. cybersecurity-integrated safety. transport systems vulnerabilities 
Customers' perception of cybersecurity threats toward e-banking adoption and retention: A conceptual study. Internet technology keeps transforming the nature and processes of organizational goals because of its capacity to assist and enhance operational and managerial performance in both the business and non-business industries. However, the presence of cybersecurity threat and privacy issues have become rampant nowadays, considering the magnitude of digital-related transactions, particularly on internet banking systems. The harmful impact perceived from the said threats negatively affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information to financial institutions (bank) and its customers. Again, the perception formed out of this displeasure (cybersecurity threat) interferes with bank customer's decision process regarding the e-banking adoption (or engagement) and retention. In view of this, the present article seeks to. (1) review empirical constructs (cybersecurity threats) in the previous work regarding customer's perception of cybersecurity threats that impedes e-banking adoption and retention and (2) propose a conceptual framework depicting the direct and indirect relationship among the constructs studied. Since the present study is entirely based on a conceptual study, we deployed both document and content analysis as a composite technique for executing the general aim of the study. Findings show that knowledge of perceived identity theft, perceived impersonation, and perceived account hijacked are regarded as cybersecurity threats from the customer's viewpoint that impedes their e-banking adoption and retention. The review discovered that victims (bank customers) of such perceived threats are apparently skeptical in their quest to engage in e-banking adoption and retention. Similarly, the cybersecurity threat-related information, however, poses a danger to users and a sense of unwillingness to engage or retain in e-banking transaction space. Practically, the survival of every business largely depends on its customer base (retention), hence this study propels the financial institutions as a reminder to strategically strengthen their security and privacy concern inasmuch as cybercrime in the banking sector is concerned. In theory, the paper adds up to the concept of cybersecurity repercussion especially in the scope of internet banking. Limitations of this present study are highlighted in the concluding part of the entire paper. Adoption. Customer's perception. Cybersecurity. E-banking. Retention. Threats 
Distributed authority as a guiding set of principles for transnational cyber security governance.Based on philosophical grounds, the concept of 'distributed authority' posits that the information age is changing the nature of power by increasing its diffusion to a vast number of actors, away from the governments towards non-state actors (such as corporations, civil society and academia). As they share power and authority, state and non-state actors alike are collectively responsible for the way the world is, will and should be. As primary agents in the international system, states are responsible for spearheading governance models in relation to transnational security issues, but in doing so they also bear the responsibility to include a variety of perspectives and actors. Correspondingly, these actors bear duties to heed those calls to participate in the co-creation of governance models. Building on the concept of distributed authority and its underlying principles, this paper proposes a set of principles that underpin transnational governance of cyber security. It argues that any governance strategy for the digital age needs to be based on an ethical framework which puts collaboration at the centre. Digital Cooperation. Distributed Authority.

Electronic healthcare record and cyber security threats: A development of an agile framework.The implementation of EHR (electronic health record) in the health sector offers significant benefits over paper-based records, especially with the current technological advancements. However, many cases of implementation failure proved to be the cause of various cybersecurity threats in the health care system. Based on a grounded theory approach, the researcher conducted interviews with IT professionals to understand the obstacles they face when implementing EHR. The data collected was organized and analyzed using NVIVO software to develop new concepts and propose a more efficient framework to successfully implement EHR and reduce cyber threats. Agile.

Leveraging the benefits of big data with fast data for effective and efficient cybersecurity analytics systems: A robust optimisation approach.In recent times, major cybersecurity breaches and cyber fraud within the public and private sectors are making international headlines. Majority of organisations are facing cybersecurity adversity and advanced threats. On the one hand, we have asynchronous cybersecurity practices, many standards and frameworks to consider while on the other hand, we have to deal and secure our organisations against cyber-criminals, organised hacktivists, insider threats, hackers and nation-states with malafide intentions. The Center for Cyber Safety and Education's Global Information Security Workforce Study (GISWS) confirms that globally we are not only loosing but also backpedalling against threats and risks at cyberspace. How do national-protection actors and organisations conduct and practice their cybersecurity to protect against dramatic attack surfaces? Most importantly, how do they allocate limited cybersecurity resources in defence? Most organisations advice to adopt systematic approaches using standards, framework, audits and best practices. However, the current security technologies, policies and processes are lacking robust cybersecurity capabilities and a mechanism to solve advanced cyber threats and risks. In this paper, we are proposing a novel solution to detect and protect against advanced cybersecurity challenges by leveraging the benefits of big data security intelligence with fast data technologies. The paper is presenting a technology-independent reference model utilising a robust optimisation approach for the cybersecurity analytic systems. This study is utilising state-of-the-art and cutting-edge reference model and solution that enables cyber secure internet and digital technologies usage along with underlying data network and information systems in the multiorganisational environment. The underlying solution enables interoperability and flawless message and information exchanges within national protection actors. The study concludes with the proof-of-concept in the cyber secure decentralised multipurpose communications network. Advanced cyber threats. Big data. Big data analytics. Cybersecurity.

Resilient cybersecurity architecture.Resilient cybersecurity is the degree of regular operation an organization can keep during a data breach, cyber-attack, system fault, or security incident. As there is no single or standard approach for how to create a resilient cybersecurity system architecture, each existing system has been built differently based on the builder's understanding of the system operation and business continuity plans. In this work, we present a methodology and procedure for how to create a resilient cybersecurity system architecture. The methodology based on situation awareness decision making constructed using a knowledge base of all previously identified unbalanced operation and (potential) breakpoints. This methodology uses specific criteria, such as time, date, situation, incident, and some indications for system behavior. We then create a recovery procedure to return the system to regular and stable operation. The architecture presented in this work based on a full understanding of the system operations and their sub-functionalities, as well as a full system threat analysis, understanding, and identification.

A strategic roadmap for cybersecurity capability engineering across different environments. Digital transformation is not without risks as the threats posed by cyber-attacks in this day and age are continually on the rise. Cyber-attacks have become pervasive and thus calling for organisations to be vigilant at all times and intentional in preserving the security of critical assets. Inopportunely, cyber-attacks are not selective in nature. as such no organisation is immune to their potential impact that often manifests in financial losses and reputational damage. This challenge gives the development of a cybersecurity capability indisputable primacy as it is relevant to all organisations that reap the benefits of interconnectedness regardless of shape, size, and environment. Be that as it may, it cannot be disputed that each business environment warrants unique consideration for cybersecurity efforts to yield effective results. While capability planning exists as a discipline, there is a lack of a consistent and coherent guide for cybersecurity capability development. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing an adaptable roadmap for developing cybersecurity capability following design science research. This roadmap will contribute by presenting practical and flexible guidelines for the development of a cybersecurity capability that can be employed in any business environment. This approach will leverage from an existing capability engineering framework while striving to augment the adaptability of the framework to cybersecurity. Capability Engineering. Cybersecurity.

Psychometric modelling of cybersecurity roles.Human psychology plays a role in career satisfaction and performance in every industry. In the face of a global shortage of cybersecurity professionals, and an often difficult team dynamic around these individuals, it is important to define and understand methods of measurement to provide maximum effectiveness and efficiency within an organization. This research analyzes predictors of individual factors of satisfaction and performance for cybersecurity roles through the integration of prominent psychometric analyses. A combination of these psychometric profiles may provide significant predictors for satisfaction and performance in broad categories of cybersecurity roles that are aggregated and condensed from NIST and several other sources. This research could provide organizations with tools to increase both agility and performance within cybersecurity functions and teams. The work is being conducted through the design science research methodology (DSRM). This allows for the creation of artifacts that address the use of psychometric measurements as predictors for individual psychological factors in cybersecurity roles. Organizations are faced with non-traditional, asymmetric threats from a myriad of cyber-connected sources. A positive conclusion would result in organizational predictors for cybersecurity functions, as well as, opportunities for organizational realignment to allow for unique psychological traits in non-traditional business operations. The findings will contain the created artifacts and results of surveys of cybersecurity professionals. The artifacts will reveal the correlation between the integrated psychometric profiles and cybersecurity functions, exposing their potential to be used as predictors for increased organizational efficiency and effectiveness as reflected by individual satisfaction.

Career development in cyber security: Bootcamp training programs. Growing number of cyber security incidents across the globe shifted the focus of governments and the IT sector to deal with the skills shortage in this domain. Developing competent individuals for this growing area triggered government institutions to craft strategy documents as well. Other than traditional undergraduate or MSc programs, there is one particular solution which receives lots of attention: cyber security training bootcamp programs. These short, focused and intense training programs, also known as bootcamps, have particularly appealed to adult learners during the past decade. The bootcamps which focus on IT and cybersecurity domains have emerged as an important pipeline to help individuals get started in IT careers. One of the key factors driving the advancement of bootcamp programs is related to the high demand for IT programs which traditional education institutes, such as universities, cannot keep up with. In this paper, we evaluated how bootcamp training programs perform in comparison with traditional training faculties. We identified several factors which could affect the popularity of bootcamp programs. cost, student satisfaction, duration, eligibility requirements, hands-on learning opportunities and industry certifications. We also presented our findings based on our own bootcamp training program results. In that bootcamp program, we created a partnership with Montclair State University and delivered an 8-week course combined with 6-week apprenticeship via our industry partners. Our approach was novel in 5 major areas. we focused on adult learners and delivered our courses during the evenings and weekends with live-online solutions using mobile and web videoconferences, we provided hands-on practices with Labtainer Docker Containers in our private cloud infrastructure, we provided courses with industry certifications, accountability and mentoring support throughout the program. The initial results indicate a very promising future for our bootcamp training program. 80% of our students were successfully accepted for an internship program and 20% of our students received a job offer and started working as a full-time cybersecurity analyst.

From simple scoring towards a meaningful interpretation of learning in cybersecurity exercises.To overcome the current skills shortfall in cybersecurity, a broad range of IT professionals and users should be educated in the fundamentals of protecting computer systems and the data they contain. This requires novel and scalable teaching methods. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce an approach of how to create cybersecurity exercises that can measure relevant competencies. We demonstrate how technical event logging can be linked to learning outcomes and skills measurement by defining intermediate abstraction layers. These take raw forensic data from the game-system and network, and gradually group them into events and abstract measurements until they can be mapped to learning theories. The suggested approach enables deeper insights into learning. This approach has been applied for developing labs using our cloud-based open-source tool. The labs have been used by more than 2 000 learners in over 15 000 sessions. A thorough hands-on skills assessment was conducted before and after a set of exercises for 27 participants. Results show that the suggested method can be used for creating and improving cybersecurity exercises. Cybersecurity education. Exercises. Learning. Skill assessment 
Cybersecurity knowledge requirements for strategic level decision makers.Assuring an organization's cyber security posture requires the active involvement of decision makers at all levels, particularly strategic level decision makers such as C-level executives. These leaders have the primary responsibility of initiating security programs, publishing organization-wide security policies and are responsible for the oversight of security policy implementation. It is necessary for these executives to be properly informed, trained, and being provided with the tools required to fulfil their strategic management responsibilities. This study aims to provide a list of topics that would serve as knowledge requirements to be used as a basis for training or cyber exercises addressing strategic level decision-makers who do not have IT or security background, which is the case in most organizations. First, we conducted a literature review to identify an initial topic list. Then, this list was processed in a card sorting survey in which professionals in the roles of CTO, CIO or CISO were requested to determine the required level of knowledge strategic leaders should ideally have on each topic. The results indicate survey participants are more prone to not excluding any topic regardless of its level of technical expertise. They believe strategic leaders should have, at least, a general understanding and awareness of the topics chosen, even if the topics represent a more technical perspective. A general trend was found wherein topics in which business knowledge intersects with security knowledge were consistently ranked with a higher knowledge requirement, mainly relating to business impact.

A Study of Ensemble Methods for Cyber Security.Ensemble methods for machine learning serve to increase the predictive power of preexisting models by applying a meta-algorithm on top of the underlying workings of one or many prediction models. These ensemble models show promise for anomaly detection over the simpler prediction models they are built on-top of without much more admin work and theory, making them ideal for network intrusion detection. This study looks at the advantages of these methods when applied to the cybersecurity domain by using the widely used NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. The types of ensemble methods studied are voting, bagging, and boosting, specifically the algorithms experimented with are the Voting classifier, boosting, Random forest classifier, and AdaBoost classifier.

Game theoretic approach applied in cybersecurity information exchange framework.In CYBersecurity information EXchange (CYBEX) framework, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is shared among multiple organizations with a view of creating situational awareness. But there is a possibility that malicious organizations coexist with regular ones in this framework, which can get hold of the threat data shared by other organizations and can use it for carrying out malicious activities. We formulate the aforementioned problem as an incomplete information game assuming that whenever CYBEX receives any information, it processes the information for anomaly detection. We find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium probabilities and corresponding Bayesian belief updates. We simulate the game to find the best response strategies with which regular and malicious organizations can play to increase their payoffs. Based on the best response strategies of organizations, we analyze that achieving more anomaly detection rate while keeping the processing rate minimum is the best action strategy with which CYBEX can play to increase the gain of both CYBEX and regular organizations over malicious organizations. We also find the approximate average minimum processing rate and anomaly detection rate with which CYBEX can play in order to maintain the payoff of itself and regular organizations higher than the malicious ones.
BloCyNfo-Share: Blockchain based Cybersecurity Information Sharing with Fine Grained Access Control.To build a proactive cyber defense system, sharing the cybersecurity information has been very popular by which any organization can get more information about unknown and new threats. Cybersecurity Information Exchange (CYBEX) is one of the important platforms which has been playing an important role in implementing proactive cyber defense system by allowing organizations sharing their cybersecurity information. However, they are centralized and therefore they may suffer from complete failure in case of any damage or accident. Moreover, while sharing private information it lacks the mechanism of providing rights to query organizations i.e., enabling the access control over the shared sensitive information. Finally, nonrepudiation of the system does not exist i.e., there is no way to track or keep the record what any organization is sharing and it is necessary to keep the record in case anyone denies after sharing false information. To address these issues, in this paper we propose blockchain based privacy preserving cybersecurity information sharing using proxy re-encryption and attribute-based encryption (BloCyNfo-Share) where the organization can achieve fine-grain access control by delegating which organization can have the access to its cybersecurity information leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology. We conduct privacy and experimental analysis of the proposed system and the findings show that the model is private as well as efficient. Access Control. Blockchain.

Legislation and the negative impact on cybersecurity in healthcare. Healthcare is a rapidly growing industry that is continuously expanding with technological advances. Similar to many other critical industries, healthcare faces an onslaught of daily cybersecurity challenges, however is largely at a disadvantage due to outdated and antiquated legislation. As of 2019, no legislation or regulatory body in healthcare adequately cover the needs of cybersecurity. However, regulations have forced healthcare to deploy technology at an expansive rate as well as having them deploy FDA, a regulatory body, approved medical devices from the assembly line that are inherently insecure. By looking at reported incidents, the authors will examine modifications to legislation in healthcare and the impact on cybersecurity-related events facing the organizational vertical. Legislation such as the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989 adversely impacts healthcare as cybersecurity is not considered a  service,  and as such, cannot be shared between two healthcare organizations. By bringing light to the inadequacies of cybersecurity in legislation and regulation of the United States healthcare system, the paper aim to bring cybersecurity to the forefront of future legislation and regulation.

Methodology and feedback about systematic cybersecurity experts auditing in Belgium.Increasing the maturity of SMEs with respect to cybersecurity threats is crucial as they are less prepared and less resilient. They are also increasingly exposed and targeted by malicious actors. Providing support means ensuring an effective ecosystem is available to help companies all along the process. Resources have to be available, from raising awareness to performing audit, increasing protection and building response capabilities. In this paper, we report about the progress achieved after one year of deployment of a Belgian cybersecurity initiative focusing on SMEs. An important goal is to make sure minimal requirements will be checked and enforced by cybersecurity experts while letting them use their own methodology. We explain how the expertise is validated using an evaluation grid based on the NIST Cybersecurity framework and CIS 20 criteria directly reflecting protection priorities for SMEs. We also highlight some interesting characteristics and lessons learned in our data set of 25 experts evaluated so far. Assessment. Cybersecurity. Lightweight framework. SME. Survey 
Quantifying the significance of cybersecurity text through semantic similarity and named entity recognition. In order to proactively mitigate the risks of cybersecurity, security analysts have to continuously monitor threat information sources. However, the sheer amount of textual information that needs to be processed is overwhelming and requires a great deal of mundane labor. We propose a novel approach to automate this process by analyzing the text document using semantic similarity and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods. The semantic representation of the given text has been compared with pre-defined  significant  text and, by using a NER model, the assets relevant to the organization are identified. The analysis results then act as features of the linear classifier to generate the significance score. The experimental result shows that the overall system could determine the significance of the text with 78% accuracy. Cyber threat. NER. Semantic similarity. Text analysis 
A study of classification of texts into categories of cybersecurity incident and attack with topic models. To improve and automate cybersecurity incident handling in security operations centers (SOCs) and computer emergency response teams (CERTs), security intelligences extracted from various internal and external sources, including incident response playbooks, incident reports in each SOCs and CERTs, the National Vulnerability Database, and social media, must be utilized. In this paper, we apply various topic models to classify text related to cybersecurity intelligence and incidents according to topics derived from incidents and cyber attacks. We analyze cybersecurity incident reports and related text in our CERT and security blog posts using naive latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), seeded LDA, and labeled LDA topic models. Labeling text based on designated categories is difficult and time-consuming. Training the seeded model does not require text to be labeled. instead, seed words are given to allow the model to infer topic-word and document-topic distributions for the text. We show that a seeded topic model can be used to extract and classify intelligence in our CERT, and we infer text more precisely compared with a supervised topic model. CERT. Cybersecurity incidents.

Methodology for the Efficiency and Cybersecurity Improvement of the SCADA Communication Network in EmelNorte Substations.This paper presents the development and pilot implementation of the methodological proposal for the improvement to the efficiency and cybersecurity of the SCADA communication network in EmelNorte substations. This is justified by the fact that the modern substations operation requires that the SCADA will become to an open system, which can be integrated with others systems related with administration and management of Energy Business. This situation, on the one hand, bring with it the need for a SCADA communication network that should be characterized by a high availability and efficiency, but on the other hand, as the SCADA becomes an open system, its cybersecurity could be compromised. In this regard, a design methodology for improving efficiency and cybersecurity of the SCADA communication network is developed by taking as references standards IEC-61850 and NERC-CIP-7. This methodology propose design guidelines for: (1) LAN architecture design in substations, (2) administration and management of SCADA communication network, and (3) cybersecurity of SCADA communication network. In order to validate the proposed guidelines, these were implemented in the communication network of substation El Retorno, and then efficiency and cybersecurity were evaluated and contrasted to that of network before the implementation. The results show significant performance improvements, and with it the potential benefits of the methodology implementation are evidenced. Communication network. Cybersecurity. Efficiency. SCADA.

An Industrial Trial of an Approach to Identification and Modelling of Cybersecurity Risks in the Context of Digital Secondary Substations.We have in an earlier study proposed a set of requirements and an approach to identification and modelling of cybersecurity risks and their impacts on safety, within the context of smart power grids. The approach, which consisted of a process and a modelling language, was a partially customized version of the existing CORAS risk-analysis approach. As a part of the study, feasibility of the approach was evaluated by applying it on an industrial pilot for so-called self-healing functionality of a smart power grid. The results obtained were promising, but further empirical evaluation was strongly needed in order to further assess usefulness and applicability of the approach in the context of smart power grids. This paper provides a detailed account of results of applying the same approach to cybersecurity risk identification and modelling in the context of another smart grid pilot, namely digital secondary substations. The trial was conducted in a real setting, in the form of an industrial case study, in close collaboration with the major Norwegian distribution system operator that has been running the pilot for about two years. The evaluation indicates that the approach can be applied in a real setting to identify and model cybersecurity risks. The experiences from the case study moreover show that the presented approach is, to a large degree, well suited for its intended purpose, but it also points to areas in need for improvement and further evaluation.

An Open and Flexible CyberSecurity Training Laboratory in IT/OT Infrastructures.There are significant concerns regarding the lack of proficient cybersecurity professionals with a background in both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). To alleviate this problem, we propose an open and flexible laboratory for experimenting with an IT/OT infrastructure and the related cybersecurity problems, such as emulating attacks and understanding how they work and how they could be identified and mitigated. We also report our experience in using the laboratory during a one-week training event with 24 students from 7 different high-schools at the mechatronics prototyping facility ProM in Rovereto (Italy).

Model-Driven Cyber Range Training: A Cyber Security Assurance Perspective.Security demands are increasing for all types of organisations, due to the ever-closer integration of computing infrastructures and smart devices into all aspects of the organisational operations. Consequently, the need for security-aware employees in every role of an organisation increases in accordance. Cyber Range training emerges as a promising solution, allowing employees to train in both realistic environments and scenarios and gaining hands-on experience in security aspects of varied complexity, depending on their role and level of expertise. To that end, this work introduces a model-driven approach for Cyber Range training that facilitates the generation of tailor-made training scenarios based on a comprehensive model-based description of the organisation and its security posture. Additionally, our approach facilitates the auto- mated deployment of such training environments, tailored to each defined scenario, through simulation and emulation means. To further highlight the usability of the proposed approach, this work also presents scenarios focusing on phishing threats, with increasing level of complexity and difficulty. Cyber Range training.

The THREAT-ARREST Cyber-Security Training Platform.Cyber security is always a main concern for critical infrastructures and nation-wide safety and sustainability. Thus, advanced cyber ranges and security training is becoming imperative for the involved organizations. This paper presets a cyber security training platform, called THREAT-ARREST. The various platform modules can analyze an organization’s system, identify the most critical threats, and tailor a training program to its personnel needs. Then, different training programmes are created based on the trainee types (i.e. administrator, simple operator, etc.), providing several teaching procedures and accomplishing diverse learning goals. One of the main novelties of THREAT-ARREST is the modelling of these programmes along with the runtime monitoring, management, and evaluation operations. The platform is generic. Nevertheless, its applicability in a smart energy case study is detailed. CTTP. Cyber range. Dynamic adaptation. Security training. Smart energy. Smart grid. Training exercises. Training programmes 
A Model Driven Approach for Cyber Security Scenarios Deployment.Cyber ranges for training in threat scenarios are nowadays highly demanded in order to improve people ability to detect vulnerabilities and to react to cyber-threats. Among the other components, scenarios deployment requires a modeling language to express the (software and hardware) architecture of the underlying system, and an emulation platform. In this paper, we exploit a model-driven engineering approach to develop a framework for cyber security scenarios deployment. We develop a domain specific language for scenarios construction, which allows the description of the architectural setting of the system under analysis, and a mechanism to deploy scenarios on the OpenStack cloud infrastructure by means of HEAT templates. On the scenario model, we also show how it is possible to detect network configuration problems and structural vulnerabilities.

sD&D: Design and Implementation of Cybersecurity Educational Game with Highly Extensible Functionality.Cybersecurity issues have gained more attention due to the rapid development of new technology. In many cases, cyber theft happened due to a lack of understanding of how to secure a single piece of private information. In the present paper, we attempt to provide an inexpensive and easy tool for learning cybersecurity through a board game simulation called Security Defense and Dungeons (sD&D). The basic concept is not only to introduce the latest cybersecurity equipment and solutions, but also to provide cybersecurity education for players to raise awareness regarding cybersecurity threats. In addition, we attempt to train users in good practices concerning team communication and human resources. The simple game interface includes cybersecurity task scenarios, featured intuitive game design for users, and easy exploration of the provided scenario. In addition, the proposed game, in which players can share game resources and bits of knowledge, communicate via a chat room. In the present study, in order to evaluate the proposed method and prototype implementation, we performed a user study with student users. The questionnaire results were mostly positive comments and opinions. Cybersecurity education. Gaming education. Security awareness 
CAMLPAD: Cybersecurity Autonomous Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly Detection.As machine learning and cybersecurity continue to explode in the context of the digital ecosystem, the complexity of cybersecurity data combined with complicated and evasive machine learning algorithms leads to vast difficulties in designing an end-to-end system for intelligent, automatic anomaly classification. On the other hand, traditional systems use elementary statistics techniques and are often inaccurate, leading to weak centralized data analysis platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel system that addresses these two problems, titled CAMLPAD, for Cybersecurity Autonomous Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly Detection. The CAMLPAD system’s streamlined, holistic approach begins with retrieving a multitude of different species of cybersecurity data in real-time using elasticsearch, then running several machine learning algorithms, namely Isolation Forest, Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS), Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), and K-Means Clustering, to process the data. Next, the calculated anomalies are visualized using Kibana and are assigned an outlier score, which serves as an indicator for whether an alert should be sent to the system administrator that there are potential anomalies in the network. After comprehensive testing of our platform in a simulated environment, the CAMLPAD system achieved an adjusted rand score of 95%, exhibiting the reliable accuracy and precision of the system. All in all, the CAMLPAD system provides an accurate, streamlined approach to real-time cybersecurity anomaly detection, delivering a novel solution that has the potential to revolutionize the cybersecurity sector.

A domain adaptation technique for deep learning in cybersecurity.In this paper we discuss an algorithm for transfer learning in cybersecurity. In particular, we develop a new image-based representation for the feature set in the source domain and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the training data. The CNN model is then augmented with one dense layer in the target domain before applying on the target dataset. The data we have used for our experimental results are taken from the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity. The results show that transfer learning is feasible in cybersecurity which offers many potential applications including resource-constrained environments such as edge computing.

Cognitive Computing Cybersecurity: Social Network Analysis.The structure and basic principles of technology for increasing the probability of identifying subjects of information processes of open Internet resources based on ontology methods are considered. Based on this ontology the knowledge base intended for creation of the program systems supporting ensuring information security has been realized. The first step in building the domain theory is a formal description of the domain ontology, i.e. the meaning of all used terms specific to the given subject area. Cognitive ontology’s of subject areas are a tool necessary to achieve high pertinence of information retrieval and are needed to describe key concepts of a given subject area. The developed ontological knowledge base has been used when developing the software complex intended for identification of the user of social networks when ensuring information security, monitoring and preventing threats. This article is next in a series of articles by the authors in which they continue to monitor and analyze the current state and new tendencies in the field of information security and safety of information.

Development of BI-Platforms for Cybersecurity Predictive Analytics.The distribution of analytical information systems, the so-called BI platforms (BI – business intelligence) in leading state and commercial companies, allows the top-managers and analysts to work in real time with large information volumes (Big Data). However, the issue of choosing tools for secure access to these new sources of corporate data becomes relevant. The trend of recent years is the integration of business security software products, and the transition from specialized analytical solutions to multipurpose BI platforms. The article considers approaches to providing security in information systems of banks and electronic commerce using multipurpose BI-platforms. The analysis of key problems in arrangement of the Big Data was performed and the problems of implementation, operation and maintenance of BI systems were identified. The analysis of the advantages of the systems of the class Advanced Analytics (Big Data, NoSQL-storages, processing of streaming data on-line) over traditional BI-systems (ETL + SQL + reports) is made. The system features of the BI-platform of security are considered: typical agents and formats of data loading agents, possible types and model of data, the structure of the computing cluster and the gateway. An algorithm for detecting security incidents is given. It has been proven that in order to reduce the dependence level on foreign technologies, the public sector should completely switch to work with Russian software and hardware platform developers. In turn, the commercial segment should also facilitate the transition to Russian developments and more actively use them in their activities. Algorithm. Analytical information systems. BI-platform.

New Methods of the Cybersecurity Knowledge Management Analytics.The article discusses the possibilities of using Master Data Management (MDM) technology to solve the problem of developing a corporate (institutional) state system segment to detect, prevent and eliminate the cyber - attack consequences (hereinafter - SOPKA). Typical objectives of semantic cyber security MDM is identified in article. The semantic cyber security MDM means a data management system that operates rules of the object behavior and interaction in cyberspace to solve the SOPKA problems in order to prevent the protected critical infrastructure transition to catastrophic states. Cyber security ontology (meta-ontology) as the knowledge presentation way about qualitative characteristics and quantitative patterns of information confrontation is proposed. Shown, that by combining cyber security data from various external and internal information sources and corresponding rules to detect, prevent, and eliminate the cyber-attacks consequences into a single semantic domain model, it is possible to build the required intellectual (and, in the future, cognitive) information space, then to develop the appropriate artificial cognitive agents and the corresponding intelligent semantic cyber security MDM software and hardware complex to support SOPKA operations as a whole. The basic development principles of the semantic cyber security MDM software and hardware complex are formulated. The possible architecture of the Warning-2016 software and hardware complex that is intended for early cyber-attack warning on corporate and institutional information resources of the Russian Federation is shown. It is based on SAP HANA, and the required semantic MDM is implemented on the basis of SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management (SAP NW MDM). Big data technologies. Convergent NBIC technologies.

How to develop a national cybersecurity strategy for developing countries. Ecuador case.The increase use of Information and Communication Technologies entails associated risks, which must be systematically managed by those responsible for state security. This need has led to the development of National Cybersecurity Strategies, which in one way or another have been created and formalized, without applying a specific model previously analyzed in reference to the good practices that have been published by international organizations working in. In these matters, the lessons learned in similar exercises carried out by states that have developed their national strategies in various ways, often with foreign consultants far from local reality, have not been considered. This work aims to cover this need and provide a systematically analyzed methodology based on the good practices developed so far, adapted to Latin American reality with an example applied in Ecuador, so that it can be used by other countries in the region or similar conditions as a methodological guide to develop your strategies.

A Cybersecurity Framework for Classifying Non Stationary Data Streams Exploiting Genetic Programming and Ensemble Learning. Intrusion detection systems have to cope with many challenging problems, such as unbalanced datasets, fast data streams and frequent changes in the nature of the attacks (concept drift). To this aim, here, a distributed genetic programming (GP) tool is used to generate the combiner function of an ensemble. this tool does not need a heavy additional training phase, once the classifiers composing the ensemble have been trained, and it can hence answer quickly to concept drifts, also in the case of fast-changing data streams. The above-described approach is integrated into a novel cybersecurity framework for classifying non stationary and unbalanced data streams. The framework provides mechanisms for detecting drifts and for replacing classifiers, which permits to build the ensemble in an incremental way. Tests conducted on real data have shown that the framework is effective in both detecting attacks and reacting quickly to concept drifts. Cybersecurity. Genetic programming. Intrusion detection 
Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Past, Presence, and Future.The rapid development of Internet services also led to a significant increase in cyber-attacks. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and automation, make the protections ineffective. Conventional cybersecurity approaches have a limited effect on fighting new cyber threats. Therefore, we need new approaches, and artificial intelligence can aid to counter cybercrime. In this paper, we present the capability of adopting artificial intelligence techniques in cybersecurity and present some of those intelligent-based approaches already in place in practice. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of AI-based approaches in cybersecurity as well as suggest some directions for research in the future. Advanced persistent threat. AI. Cybersecurity.

Derivation of a Conceptual Framework to Assess and Mitigate Identified Customer Cybersecurity Risks by Utilizing the Public Cloud.The number of end points connecting to the cloud can increase distributed attack vectors due to vulnerable devices connecting from the front end. The risk is also enhanced due to the technological abstractions associated with public cloud computing models at the back end. On the one hand, cloud service providers make sets of defined service criteria and supporting documentation, publicly available to assist customers with their public cloud deployments. However, on the other hand, a cacophony of security incidents over the past five years involving vulnerable cloud customer instantiations reveals that cloud security risks may not be completely comprehended. Essentially, the fundamental principle of cloud computing is the ‘shared security responsibility’ model. It is argued in this paper that from a cloud customer perspective, there is either too much reliance upon legacy risk assessment methods and/or standards orientated compliance-mapping approaches when trying to apply due diligence for cybersecurity. This can be amplified by different cloud service providers using terms like ‘core services’ and ‘managed services’ rather than traditional terms such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service. This extended paper describes the myriad of techniques used to derive a conceptual framework through post-graduate research. Based around a defense-in-depth model, the proposed conceptual framework is a proof of concept to enable customers to focus on the contextualized risks when using the public cloud. A method of reducing the risks using mitigation categories is also proposed. Consequently, a method of calculating residual risk against the identified risks levels is theoretically defined and dependent upon the rigor of counter-measure selection. Cloud risk. Cloud security.

Exploring how component factors and their uncertainty affect judgements of risk in cyber-security.Subjective judgements from experts provide essential information when assessing and modelling threats in respect to cyber-physical systems. For example, the vulnerability of individual system components can be described using multiple factors, such as complexity, technological maturity, and the availability of tools to aid an attack. Such information is useful for determining attack risk, but much of it is challenging to acquire automatically and instead must be collected through expert assessments. However, most experts inherently carry some degree of uncertainty in their assessments. For example, it is impossible to be certain precisely how many tools are available to aid an attack. Traditional methods of capturing subjective judgements through choices such as high, medium or low do not enable experts to quantify their uncertainty. However, it is important to measure the range of uncertainty surrounding responses in order to appropriately inform system vulnerability analysis. We use a recently introduced interval-valued response-format to capture uncertainty in experts’ judgements and employ inferential statistical approaches to analyse the data. We identify key attributes that contribute to hop vulnerability in cyber-systems and demonstrate the value of capturing the uncertainty around these attributes. We find that this uncertainty is not only predictive of uncertainty in the overall vulnerability of a given system component, but also significantly informs ratings of overall component vulnerability itself. We propose that these methods and associated insights can be employed in real world situations, including vulnerability assessments of cyber-physical systems, which are becoming increasingly complex and integrated into society, making them particularly susceptible to uncertainty in assessment.

Everything is awesome! or is it? Cyber security risks in critical infrastructure.Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play an important role in the monitoring, control and automation of critical infrastructure such as water, gas, oil and electricity. Recent years have seen a number of high profile cyber attacks on such infrastructure exemplified by Stuxnet and the Ukrainian Power Grid attacks. This naturally begs the question: how should we manage cyber security risks in such infrastructure on which the day-to-day functioning of societies rely? What are the complexities of managing security in a landscape shaped by the often competing demands of a variety of stakeholders, e.g., managers, control engineers, enterprise IT personnel and field site operators? What are the challenges posed by the convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and critical infrastructure through the so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)? In this paper, we discuss insights from a multi-year programme of research investigating these issues and the challenges to addressing them. Critical infrastructure. Cyber risk decisions.

Using datasets from industrial control systems for cyber security research and education.The availability of high-quality benchmark datasets is an important prerequisite for research and education in the cyber security domain. Datasets from realistic systems offer a platform for researchers to develop and test novel models and algorithms. Such datasets also offer students opportunities for active and project-centric learning. In this paper, we describe six publicly available datasets from the domain of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Five of these datasets are obtained through experiments conducted in the context of operational ICS while the sixth is obtained from a widely used simulation tool, namely EPANET, for large scale water distribution networks. This paper presents two studies on the use of the datasets. The first study uses the dataset from a live water treatment plant. This study leads to a novel and explainable anomaly detection method based upon Timed Automata and Bayesian Networks. The study conducted in the context of education made use of the water distribution network dataset in a graduate course on cyber data analytics. Through an assignment, students explored the effectiveness of various methods for anomaly detection. Research outcomes and the success of the course indicate an appreciation in the research community and positive learning experience in education. Anomaly detection. Cyber Data Analytics.

On the Design of a Privacy Preserving Collaborative Platform for Cybersecurity.Nowadays, cyber-attacks are targeting mobile devices, bank accounts, connected vehicles and cyber-physical systems. These attacks are becoming more complex and are raising safety problems when targeting physical environment. An efficient way to protect against these attacks is making several security actors collaborate in defining appropriate countermeasures. However, in practice, security actors refrain from collaborating to avoid sharing their proprietary security processes. These processes represent a critical knowledge as they reflect these actors brand images. In this work, we investigate the use of homomorphic encryption to define a privacy preserving framework for sharing processes between different cybersecurity actors and for providing confidential data analysis. We describe a high level design for a secure cloud platform managing encrypted data. The data analysis algorithms provided by the cloud platform are designed with our open source tool Cingulata, which enables designers to implement any data analysis function, compile it and run it on homomorphically encrypted data.

An analysis of cybersecurity legislation and policy creation on the state level.To best create an effective cybersecurity strategy, it is imperative to understand the policy discussions and trends on a federal and state level. Effective cybersecurity legislation is vital to maintaining our country’s infrastructure and protecting our citizenry. Since cybersecurity is often decided on the state level, states need to be aware of the trends in cybersecurity legislation. The purpose of this research was to conduct an analysis of cybersecurity policy from across the United States in an effort to assist the State-level understanding on their cybersecurity risk profile. This analysis included an examination of common trends in cybersecurity legislation. It involved researching cybersecurity policies from all 50 states and the federal government. After creating this baseline, the next phase of the research was to find and record relevant metadata for each policy. This data contained additional data, such as did it pass, who were the supporters, was it revised and other information that is useful to cybersecurity policy creators. The final goal of the research was to provide a searchable tool that could be utilized to fashion a successful cybersecurity bill and a summary of cybersecurity trends from 2011 to Spring 2018.

A survey of cyber security practices in small businesses.Small businesses are a unique class of organization with challenging cyber security problems that are frequently overlooked. These firms are being increasingly targeted for cyber-attack. These firms are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attack due to the often-valuable information they handle coupled with overworked and undertrained IT support. The University of Alabama in Huntsville is conducting an on-going survey of the cyber security practices of small businesses seeking to implement the NIST SP 800-171 cyber security standard. The data gathered indicates that small businesses in this field are likely to engage in poor security practices arising from common cyber security misconceptions. Compliance. Information assurance.

A comparison study of cybersecurity workforce frameworks and future directions.The cybersecurity industry is continuing to grow in workforce participation due to the growing popularity of its services in both commercial and government organizations. The government has recognized and created several frameworks that outline the work role standards for the multiple sectors. A comparison of these frameworks would not only provide a perspective of the purpose for maintaining different frameworks, but also provide a model of their relationships and the sectors that they cover. This paper will compare frameworks, outline the differences and similarities among them, and suggest ways to promote the workforce participation even more. Cybersecurity frameworks. Knowledge Units.

Capacity building for a cybersecurity workforce through hands-on labs for internet-of-things security.There is growing concern about a cybersecurity skills gap nationwide, as an insufficient number of students are entering this field. Hence, innovative approaches to capacity building are required. We advocate an approach that taps into public awareness and usage of internet-of-things (IoT) devices, which constitute a major source of security vulnerabilities. There is increasing student curiosity about these devices, and a growing tinkering movement. We tap into this zeitgeist by proposing educational courseware to give students hands-on laboratory experience in designing secure embedded systems. Our initial experience at offering this courseware on the Raspberry-Pi computing platform resulted in significant student interest and engagement. We propose building on this momentum by creating further laboratory exercises focused on IoT devices in the medical and healthcare domain. This is a rich domain for security applications due to patient privacy concerns, the need to secure medical devices, and the need to share patient medical records. The newly proposed labs will deploy RFID and barcodes to tag medical devices used in hospitals, sensors to measure patient vitals, biometrics to identify patients, and blockchain to create immutable patient records. These labs can be easily implemented with cheap sensors on the Raspberry-Pi platform, and can be replicated easily. By using this approach, we can build a national talent pool in the area of secure embedded devices. We are in the process of developing these proposed labs. We plan to test them in a classroom setting in Fall 2019. Upon successful testing, we plan to release our labs to interested institutions. Curriculum development. Cybersecurity. Internet of things 
Cybersecurity framework requirements to quantify vulnerabilities based on GQM.Of particular importance for an organization in building an effective and comprehensive secure system is to addressing a mechanism to provide a standard framework that is free from vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity experts and security requirement engineers have been addressing security issues that originated from cybersecurity requirements. Many security issues can be avoided if the security requirements are configured appropriately. In this paper, we proposed a hierarchy security requirements model based on the Goal Question Metrics (GQM) and its application mapped with the security standards towards constructing vulnerability measurements at the early stage of security development of the system design.

Developing and implementing a cybersecurity course for middle school.Investing in raising a generation with more security-aware minds is vital in preventing many of the security incidents that threaten individuals, organizations, businesses and nations today. In addition, there is a high need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals to protect our networks, computer systems, and infrastructure. Early exposure to basic cybersecurity concerns and concepts is key to developing awareness, piquing student interest, and laying foundation for more complex skill development. In this work, authors present their work developing a middle school cybersecurity curriculum for U.S. grade 8 students. This includes standards, objectives, and lessons for implementation within a year-long business and computer science course. The authors also share their experience and results from piloting the curriculum with nearly sixty grade 8 students in two classes at a Title I middle school in Columbus, GA during the 2017–2018 school year. A comparison of pre and post test results on the content show a significant growth in mastery of key cybersecurity concepts. In addition, artifacts from the course indicate an increased student interest in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity curriculum. K-12 education. Middle school 
Integration of cyber security in healthcare equipment.The expansion of digital technologies in operational technologies (OT) has significantly supported the development of new features and capabilities. However, the integration of information technologies (IT) in such environments, has also led to the inheritance of cyber security risks. This has also created new potential operational risks due to the fact that operations are controlled by a computer or digital device. Most of the equipment, such as from healthcare, that has IT systems embedded and performing certain processes, is subject to vulnerabilities and prone to cyber-attacks similar to computers. The developing capabilities and integration of IT in various operations offers the capability to introduce new features and monitoring capacity that were not possible before, or had a very high cost. The applications and integrations are countless, and do bring improvements for the society, both for the healthcare providers, as well as for the patients. However, the healthcare systems were designed with the focus on operation and safety. The security concept was not always known or taken into account due to the technologies used before. In addition, if we refer to healthcare equipment that uses nuclear or radiological sources for treatment, then safety, as well as security, should be of core importance. Even if there are certain cyber security prevention or monitoring capabilities that are possible to be enabled in some devices, these were not always used due to the perceived high risk of an operational risk. Recent research has proven that the compromise of an OT via a cyber security attack is possible, and thus, security controls and mitigation are not to be neglected anymore [1]. In this paper we will look into the current issues that cyber security risks could create to operational technologies, with a focus on the healthcare sector. Cyber security. Healthcare.

Cyber Security Metrics Evaluation Using Multi-criteria Decision-Making Approach.Cyberspace is the trust-worthy environment in which message transmission over computer networks occurs. Cyber security aims to protect the information and other resources from malicious users, external or internal within the organization. Metrics is a general name that used to the set of measures that describe a suitable applications. The aim of security metrics is to make certain business and minimize business damage by preventing or lowering the impact of cyber incidents. A metric can be developed to measure cyber security trust-worthiness of a company. The measurement of security metrics can be viewed as multiple-criteria decision-making problem (MCDM). In the present paper we are comparing two MCDM approaches: AHP and Electre III to evaluate cyber security metrics. AHP. ELECTRE III. MCDM. Outranking. Security metrics 
5G Cybersecurity Based on the Blockchain Random Neural Network in Intelligent Buildings. 5G promises much faster Internet transmission rates at minimum latencies with indoor and outdoor coverage. 5G potentially could replace traditional Wi-Fi for network connectivity and Bluetooth technology for geolocation with a seamless radio coverage and network backbone that will accelerate new services such as the Internet of Things (IoT). New infrastructure applications will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks to connect devices. however, this will increase cybersecurity risks as radio networks and mobile access channels will be shared between independent services. To address this issue, this paper presents a digital channel authentication method based on the Blockchain Random Neural Network to increase Cybersecurity against rogue 5G nodes. in addition, the proposed solution is applied to Physical Infrastructure: an Intelligent Building. The validation results demonstrate that the addition of the Blockchain Neural Network provides a cybersecure channel access control algorithm that identifies 5G rogue nodes where 5G node identities are kept cryptographic and decentralized. 5G.

A fuzzy based MCDM methodology for risk evaluation of cyber security technologies.Cyber security that also known as information technology security is to protect computers, mobile devices, servers, electronic systems and networks from malicious digital attacks. In recent years, cyber security threats have been a growing problem for any critical digital infrastructure and various cyber-attacks created over the Internet are also becoming a big issue for the society. Therefore, the use of technologies developed to provide cyber security is very important. However, the risks of cyber security technologies should be taken into account when choosing among cyber security technologies. For this aim, we have proposed a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) that gives experts extra flexibility in using linguistic terms to evaluate the criteria and alternatives to determine the best cyber security technology. For this aim, a study has also been discussed which deals with risk factors in the selection of cyber security technologies via fuzzy MCDM process. Cyber security technology. Hesitant fuzzy sets.

Cyber Security Situation Prediction Model Based on GWO-SVM.Human life and work are inseparable from information technology, and the cyber security issues that follow have become increasingly severe. In order to predict the development trend of cyber safety more accurately, this paper establishes a kind of network safety situation forecast model based on Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to optimize support vector machine (SVM) parameters, and solves the problem of support vector machine (SVM) parameter optimization. It overcomes the problems of neural network training and local optimization, which makes it more generalized, also effectively improve the prediction effect of SVM. The simulation experiments indicate that this model has improved the accuracy of prediction and shows the general tendency of the network security situation.
Cyber resilient behavior: Integrating human behavioral models and resilience engineering capabilities into cyber security. Cybercrime is on the rise. With the ongoing digitization of our society, it is expected that, sooner or later, all organizations have to deal with cyberattacks. hence organizations need to be more cyber resilient. This paper presents a novel framework of cyber resilience, integrating models from resilience engineering and human behavior. Based on a pilot study with nearly 60 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands, this paper shows that the proposed framework holds the promise for better development of human aspects of cyber resilience within organizations. The framework provides organizations with diagnostic capability into how to better prepare for emerging cyber threats, while assuring the viability of human aspects of cyber security critical to their business continuity. Moreover, knowing the sources of behavior that predict cyber resiliency may help in the development of successful behavioral intervention programs. Cyber hygiene behavior.

Cyber security on sea transport.Automation and digitization of the transport industry is a global priority. In place of the traditional pilot vehicle control comes the technology of using autonomous crewless control. The developments of various crewless vehicles, trains, aircraft, and ships are carried out. Crewless vehicles for various economic assessments will give a significant increase in the economy, not only the transport industry. However, in the absence of the pilot (crew), various situations arise that lead to a violation of transport safety. One of the main problems can be considered cybersecurity on vehicles of any type. In this paper, an analysis of the cybersecurity status of information systems on the maritime crewless vessels of the new generation is carried out. Data for the study were taken from open sources. The analysis is based on the Maritime Cyber-Risk Assessment model. The least protected systems that are most valuable for cybercriminals are identified: an automatic identification system, global navigation satellite systems, and sensor systems. AIS.

Singapore’s cybersecurity act 2018: A new generation standard for critical information infrastructure protection. National mechanisms of critical information infrastructure (CII) protection differ depending on the information assets, authorities’ powers, methods of regulation, etc. Singapore implements the state-driven approach for CII protection that is balanced and calibrated in order to harmonize the efficient powers of authorities with the burdens imposed on IT industry parties. Singapore’s Cybersecurity Act 2018 (CSA) establishes a solid and precise framework for the CII protection specifying three core aspects: constant cooperation of public authorities and private sector in envisaging a CII system. broad authorities for prevention, management and response to cybersecurity threats and incidents in Singapore, and compulsory licensing of cybersecurity services. It emphasizes compliance with promulgated codes of practice and expresses designation of CII and cybersecurity threats. The distinctive feature of the act is its significant reduction of the compliance burden on cybersecurity professionals and CII owners. As for the CII protection it’s important that computer systems in the supply chain supporting the operation of a CII (i.e. data centre owners and cloud services operators) will not be designated as CIIs. Thus the CSA illustrates the narrow approach of law makers in envisaging its jurisdiction – it implies just CII owners and not any network operators. Singapore is a first jurisdiction in South-East region that has developed its cybersecurity legislation to impose requirements on certain businesses to implement protections against cybersecurity risks into their computer systems.

Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics – Course Development in a Higher Education Institution.Individuals and companies have a feeling of insecurity in the Internet, as every day a reasonable amount of attacks take place against users’ privacy and confidentiality. The use of digital equipment in illicit and unlawful activities has increasing. Attorneys, criminal polices, layers and courts staff have to deal with crimes committed with digital weapons, whose evidences have to be examined and reported by applying digital forensics methods.

Implementation of Active Learning in the Master’s Program on Cybersecurity.The paper examines the possibility and practical approach of combining the higher education standards in Ukraine and the best international practices in the training Cybersecurity specialists, since the process of transformation and formation of the world information society will gain momentum. The National Sustainable Development Strategy (see 3.1 National Security and Defense Reform [1]) for the period up to 2020 gives opportunity for a competitive global environment and the implementation of a number of innovations at the national level. It is impossible to handle these issues without assurance of having access to the modern infrastructure by all population sectors in order to effectively use it in practice. Essentially, the approach proposed in the CDIO standard, which creates conditions for active learning of technical students, is applied. The approach has been tested at two higher educational institutions of Ukraine (State University of Telecommunications and Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University) and described through of the program of the course Wireless and Mobile Security. The paper presents the results of master’s research. Active learning. Cybersecurity. Information and communication systems. Learning outcomes. Professional competences. Wireless security 
Algorithms for Forming a Knowledge Base for Decision Support Systems in Cybersecurity Tasks.The article proposes a general structure of the modular decision support system (DSS) in cybersecurity tasks. A model is described for the subsystem of fuzzy inference (FI). Based on the FI rules for input values that can be obtained from sensors, multi-agent systems, SIEM sensors that detect the presence of threats, cyberattacks, anomalies, it is suggested to determine the output values for estimating the protection degree of critical computer systems (CCS) using DSS. The model assumes that the input values for the FI subsystem were obtained as a result of the fuzzification procedure in the corresponding module. Each element of the output values characterizes the presence or absence of a sign of unforeseen situations associated with anomalies, attacks or other attempts to interfere with the work of the CCS without authorization. An algorithm is proposed for forming a knowledge base of unforeseen (emergency) and typical situations in CCS. The algorithm differs from the known ones in that it made it possible to form a set of cases of typical responses to threats, anomalies and attacks in CCS, as well as rules for the output for authentication of unforeseen situations which are primarily associated with a targeted destructive impact on CCS. The use of the fuzzy logic output module allows one to display the state of the most vulnerable components of CCS as a multiparameter image. The obtained multiparameter image can be applied in DSS for a qualitative assessment of the security of CCS. Critical computer systems. Cybersecurity. Decision support system. Multiparameter image.
