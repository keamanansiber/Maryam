One thing I've been torn between is going the software dev route, or the information technology route. I know in the long run, I would enjoy IT, and specifically cyber security more than dev work, but I don't want to go this route if I'm looking at making half the salary as a dev. I know that on the high end of things, devs make more money. But I was wondering if you guys had any insight on what an average dev vs average IT professional would make. From my own research so far, it seems as if they are very close in salary, with devs making marginally more. Any help insight would be great! Thanks!\u001b[m\n",

There is nothing quite like the feeling of finally running some successful code. Hours upon hours of troubleshooting and BAM it finally runs! I honestly loved it. I get jealous of programmers that get to code cool stuff all the time. Not to mention their paychecks/ light workload. I had a passion for it; I always made sure my code was neat and organized, that the code was well commented and easily readable. My professor even used my code as an example to the class a few times. I always liked helping my fellow classmates troubleshoot their own code.. it was so rewarding. One time, my professor reached out to me about an internship. I declined because I had another one lined up, a fraud analyst in the cybersecurity dept of an insurance company, which I do now.  I am on the tail end of my college career, one more summer class and I'm done with my BA. My job will convert from part time to full time.\n",

I do some light coding with XML in Splunk from time to time but thats about it. I feel my coding skills are slipping away. As if it were a spoken language that I no longer speak. It makes me sad man.

And when I refer to cybersecurity jobs I'm meaning like analysts more than SWEs or MLEs specializing in security. In comparison to other fields when you take the amount of work and education required into account, it just seems... terrible? I get that you don't really need a degree to be an analyst but every job seems to require a B.S. or higher. A lot of people I've met who work in the field are expected to be on call all the time, do their own research in their free time, and typically work 60+ hours per week. Insanely stressful job too from what I've heard. And the skills required seem to be much more difficult to acquire. And companies claim there's an insane shortage of cybersecurity talent (which I know is true) but I still see most analyst positions outside of CA/WA around the 50-70k range. Maybe I'm just seeing a subset of the market. Is this something you all have experienced?\u001b[m\n",
