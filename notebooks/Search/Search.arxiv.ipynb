      "            \"d\": \"Cybersecurity is increasingly a concern for small and medium-sized\\nenterprises (SMEs), and there exist many awareness training programs and tools\\nfor them. The literature mainly studies SMEs as a unitary type of company and\\nprovides one-size-fits-all recommendations and solutions. However, SMEs are not\\nhomogeneous. They are diverse with different vulnerabilities, cybersecurity\\nneeds, and competencies. Few studies considered such differences in standards\\nand certificates for security tools adoption and cybersecurity tailoring for\\nthese SMEs. This study proposes a classification framework with an outline of\\ncybersecurity improvement needs for each class. The framework suggests five SME\\ntypes based on their characteristics and specific security needs: cybersecurity\\nabandoned SME, unskilled SME, expert-connected SME, capable SME, and\\ncybersecurity provider SME. In addition to describing the five classes, the\\nstudy explains the framework's usage in sampled SMEs. The framework proposes\\nsolutions for each class to approach cybersecurity awareness and competence\\nmore consistent with SME needs.
